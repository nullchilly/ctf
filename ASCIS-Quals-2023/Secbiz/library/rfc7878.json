To utilize this framework, one needs a substrate protocol.\r\nGiven that the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is currently\r\nwidely used for messaging between elements of such provisioning\r\nsystems, this document specifies the usage of SOAP (via HTTPS) as the\r\nsubstrate protocol for SPPF.  The benefits include leveraging\r\nprevalent expertise and a higher probability that existing\r\nprovisioning systems will be able to easily migrate to using an \\%SPPF-\r\nbased protocol.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["SPPP","SIP","Peering","SED","Provisioning"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7878","errata_url":null}
