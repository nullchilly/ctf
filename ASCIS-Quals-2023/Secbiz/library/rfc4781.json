This document extends this mechanism to minimize the\r\nnegative effects on MPLS forwarding caused by the Label Switching\r\nRouter's (LSR's) control plane restart, and specifically by the\r\nrestart of its BGP component when BGP is used to carry MPLS labels\r\nand the LSR is capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding state across\r\nthe restart.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism described in this document is agnostic with respect to\r\nthe types of the addresses carried in the BGP Network Layer\r\nReachability Information (NLRI) field.  As such, it works in\r\nconjunction with any of the address families that could be carried\r\nin BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc.).
