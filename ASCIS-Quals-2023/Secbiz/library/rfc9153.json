These solutions will support Unmanned Aircraft System Remote\r\nIdentification and tracking (UAS RID) for security, safety, and other\r\npurposes (e.g., initiation of identity-based network sessions\r\nsupporting UAS applications). DRIP will facilitate use of existing\r\nInternet resources to support RID and to enable enhanced related\r\nservices, and it will enable online and offline verification that RID\r\ninformation is trustworthy.","pub_date":"February 2022","keywords":["DRIP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9153","errata_url":null}
