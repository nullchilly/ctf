The\r\nderivation of Session-Id was not given for EAP Subscriber Identity\r\nModule (EAP-SIM) or EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA)\r\nwhen using the fast reconnect exchange instead of full\r\nauthentication.  The derivation of Session-Id for full authentication\r\nis clarified for both EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  The derivation of\r\nSession-Id for Protected EAP (PEAP) is also given.  The definition\r\nfor PEAP follows the definition for other TLS-based EAP methods.","pub_date":"October 2020","keywords":["EAP","PEAP","EAP-AKA","EAP-SIM","ERP","FILS","Session-ID","fast reconnect","TLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5247"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8940","errata_url":null}
