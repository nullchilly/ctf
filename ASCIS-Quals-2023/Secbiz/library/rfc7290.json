Observing that the metric\r\ndefinitions themselves should be the primary focus rather than the\r\nimplementations of metrics, this memo describes the test procedures\r\nto evaluate specific metric requirement clauses to determine if the\r\nrequirement has been interpreted and implemented as intended.  Two\r\ncompletely independent implementations have been tested against the\r\nkey specifications of RFC 2680.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":["packet loss","IPPM implementation comparison","perfas+","netem","IPPM comparison","metric\u00a0test","\u00a0WIPM","NetProbe"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7290","errata_url":null}
