{"draft":"draft-templin-ranger-09","doc_id":"RFC5720","title":"Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER)","authors":["F. Templin"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"26","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and\r\naddressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term\r\n\"enterprise network\" within this context extends to a wide variety of\r\nuse cases and deployment scenarios, where an \"enterprise\" can be as\r\nsmall as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a\r\nMobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational\r\ncorporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks\r\nwill require an architected solution for the coordination of routing\r\nand addressing plans with accommodations for scalability,\r\nprovider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These\r\nconsiderations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the\r\nsame principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER\r\narchitecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive\r\nframework for IPv6\/IPv4 coexistence.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["enterprise network"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5720","errata_url":null}
