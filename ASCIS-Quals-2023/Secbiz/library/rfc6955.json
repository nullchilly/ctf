These\r\nalgorithms are designed to provide a Proof-of-Possession of the\r\nprivate key and not to be a general purpose signing algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2875.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":["POP","ECDH","DH"],"obsoletes":["RFC2875"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6955","errata_url":null}
