Similar to home agents in\r\nMobile IPv6, Local Mobility Anchors of Proxy Mobile IPv6 serve as\r\nmulticast subscription anchor points, while Mobile Access Gateways\r\nprovide Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy functions.  In this\r\nscenario, mobile nodes remain agnostic of multicast mobility\r\noperations.  Support for mobile multicast senders is outside the\r\nscope of this document.  This document is not an Internet Standards \r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":["MLD proxy","multicast routing","mobility management","transparent handover"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6224","errata_url":null}
