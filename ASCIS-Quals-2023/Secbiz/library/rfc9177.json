The Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 options\r\nare not intended to replace the Block1 and Block2 options but rather\r\nhave the goal of supporting Non-confirmable (NON) messages for large\r\namounts of data with fewer packet interchanges. Also, the Q-Block1\r\nand Q-Block2 options support faster recovery should any of the blocks\r\nget lost in transmission.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":["Quick-Block","Robust-Block","R-Block","Tough-Block","Resilient-Block","Fast-Block","Resilience","Filtering","Faster transmission","Large amounts of data","Less packet interchange","Fast recovery","DOTS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9177","errata_url":null}
