The discussions\r\ncovered issues of terminology, the role of user interfaces, classes\r\nof mitigation, some specific use cases, transition strategies\r\n(including opportunistic encryption), and more.  The workshop ended\r\nwith a few high-level recommendations, that it is believed could be\r\nimplemented and could help strengthen the Internet.  This is the\r\nreport of that workshop.\r\n\r\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\r\nworkshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\r\nthose of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB\r\nviews and positions.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["IAB","W3C","STREWS","security","pervasive monitoring","London"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7687","errata_url":null}
