The package allows for fax calls to\r\nbe supported in two different ways.  The first one utilizes ITU-T\r\nRecommendation T.38 for fax relay under the control of the Call\r\nAgent.  The second one lets the gateway decide upon a method for fax\r\ntransmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without\r\nCall Agent involvement.  This memo provides information for the Internet \r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":["mgcp","fax calls","fax relay","fax transmission"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5347","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5347"}
