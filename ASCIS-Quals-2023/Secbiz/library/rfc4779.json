The\r\nemerging Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC\/BPL) access\r\ntechnology is also discussed for completeness.  In this document we\r\nwill discuss main components of IPv6 BB networks, their differences\r\nfrom IPv4 BB networks, and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in\r\neach of these networks using tunneling mechanisms and native IPv6.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2007","keywords":["v6ops","isp","ipv6","deployment","scenarios","broadband","networks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4779","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4779"}
