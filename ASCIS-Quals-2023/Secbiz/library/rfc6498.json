Although the focus is\r\non VBD, the General-Purpose Media Descriptor Parameter package can be\r\nused to authorize other modes of operation, not relevant to VBD, for\r\na particular codec.  In addition to defining these new packages, this\r\ndocument describes the use of the Media Format Parameter package and\r\nFax package with VBD, redundancy, and FEC.
