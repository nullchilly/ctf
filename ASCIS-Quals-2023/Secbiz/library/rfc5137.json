With ASCII coding,\r\nthe traditional escape has been either the decimal or hexadecimal\r\nnumeric value of the character, written in a variety of different\r\nways.  The move to Unicode, where characters occupy two or more\r\noctets and may be coded in several different forms, has further\r\ncomplicated the question of escapes.  This document discusses some\r\noptions now in use and discusses considerations for selecting one for\r\nuse in new IETF protocols, and protocols that are now being\r\ninternationalized.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"February 2008","keywords":["[--------]","Text","internationalization","ascii","unicode","utf-8","encoding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0137"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5137","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5137"}
