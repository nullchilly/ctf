A CDNI\r\nRequest Routing Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface\r\n(FCI) is needed to achieve the goals of a CDNI. RFC 8008 defines the\r\nFCI semantics and provides guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the\r\nexact protocol is not specified. This document defines a new\r\nApplication-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service, called \"CDNI\r\nAdvertisement Service\", that provides an implementation of the FCI,\r\nfollowing the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.","pub_date":"July 2022","keywords":["ALTO"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9241","errata_url":null}
