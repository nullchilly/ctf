In addition to NAT's many\r\nserious disadvantages, there is a perception that other benefits\r\nexist, such as a variety of management and security attributes that\r\ncould be useful for an Internet Protocol site.  IPv6 was designed\r\nwith the intention of making NAT unnecessary, and this document shows\r\nhow Local Network Protection (LNP) using IPv6 can provide the same or\r\nmore benefits without the need for address translation.
