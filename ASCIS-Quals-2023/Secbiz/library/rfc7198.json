In unicast transmissions, recovering from such an outage\r\ncan be difficult depending on the outage duration, due to the\r\npotentially large number of missing packets.  In multicast\r\ntransmissions, recovery is even more challenging as many receivers\r\ncould be impacted by the outage.  For this challenge, one solution\r\nthat does not incur unbounded delay is to duplicate the packets and\r\nsend them in separate redundant streams, provided that the underlying\r\nnetwork satisfies certain requirements.  This document explains how\r\nReal-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without\r\nbreaking RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["RTP duplication","live\/live","redundancy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7198","errata_url":null}
