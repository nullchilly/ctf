Exploratory Groups may be created as the\r\nfirst step toward Working Group formation, or as an\r\nintermediate step between a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session\r\nand Working Group creation.  Exploratory Groups are focused on\r\ncompletion of prerequisites for Working Group formation, and\r\nas a result they have a short life-time, with limited\r\nopportunities for milestone extension.
