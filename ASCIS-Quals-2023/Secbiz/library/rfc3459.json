Burger"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"24","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Voice Profile for Internet Mail","abstract":" This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message.  The mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC 3204. By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  Critical content can help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward.  It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to  deliver a body part.  It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the receiving system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the receiver must process.
