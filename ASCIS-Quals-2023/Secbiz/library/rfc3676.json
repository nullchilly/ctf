In the presence of these parameters, trailing whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and a canonical quote indicator is used to indicate quoted lines.  This results in an encoding which appears as normal Text\/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact normal Text\/Plain, yet provides for superior wrapping\/flowing, and quoting.  This document supersedes the one specified in RFC 2646, \"The Text\/Plain Format Parameter\", and adds the DelSp parameter to accommodate languages\/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces are not used or appear rarely.
