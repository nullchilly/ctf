The registration mechanism can also\r\nbe used to export resource information.  The prefix and resource\r\ninformation can then be passed on to a Telephony Routing over IP\r\n(TRIP) Location Server, which in turn can propagate that routing\r\ninformation within and between Internet Telephony Administrative\r\nDomains (ITADs).  TGREP shares a lot of similarities with the TRIP\r\nprotocol.  It has similar procedures and finite state machine for\r\nsession establishment.  It also shares the same format for messages\r\nand a subset of attributes with TRIP.
