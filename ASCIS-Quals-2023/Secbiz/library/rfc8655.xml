      <t pn="section-abstract-1">
		This document provides the overall architecture for
		Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability
		to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for
		real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and
		bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used
		include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or
		aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate
		nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes
		for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the
		network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow
		packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each
		packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates
		at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer
		technologies such as MPLS and Time-Sensitive
		Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.

      <t pn="section-1-1">
        This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic
        Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability for the delivery of
        data flows with extremely low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end
        delivery latency.  DetNet is for networks that are under a single
        administrative control or within a closed group of administrative
        control; these include campus-wide networks and private WANs. DetNet
        is not for large groups of domains such as the Internet.  </t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">
        DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer
        technologies such as MPLS and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking
        (TSN).

DetNet provides a reliable and available service by dedicating network
resources such as link bandwidth and buffer space to DetNet flows and/or
classes of DetNet flows, and by replicating packets along multiple paths.
Unused reserved resources are available to non-DetNet packets as long as all
guarantees are fulfilled.  </t>
      <t pn="section-1-3"> The <xref target="RFC8557" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8557">"Deterministic
Networking Problem Statement"</xref> introduces DetNet, and <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578">"Deterministic Networking Use Cases"</xref> summarizes the
need for it.  See <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DETNET-FRAMEWORK"/> for specific techniques
that can be used to identify DetNet flows and assign them to specific paths
through a network.  </t>
      <t pn="section-1-4"> A goal of DetNet is a converged network in all
respects, including the convergence of sensitive non-IP networks onto a common
network infrastructure.  The presence of DetNet flows does not preclude
non-DetNet flows, and the benefits offered DetNet flows should not, except in
extreme cases, prevent existing Quality-of-Service (QoS) mechanisms from
operating in a normal fashion, subject to the bandwidth required for the
DetNet flows.  A single source-destination pair can trade both DetNet and
non-DetNet flows.  End systems and applications need not instantiate special
interfaces for DetNet flows.  Networks are not restricted to certain
topologies; connectivity is not restricted.  Any application that generates a
data flow that can be usefully characterized as having a maximum bandwidth
should be able to take advantage of DetNet, as long as the necessary resources
can be reserved.

Reservations can be made by the application itself, via network management,
centrally by an application's controller, or by other means, for instance, by
placing on-demand reservation via a distributed Control Plane, e.g.,
leveraging the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) <xref target="RFC2205" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2205"/>.

QoS requirements of DetNet flows can be met if all network
nodes in a DetNet domain implement DetNet capabilities. DetNet nodes can be
interconnected with different sub-network technologies (<xref target="sec_dt_dp" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.1.2"/>) where the nodes of the subnet are not DetNet aware
(<xref target="netref" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.1.3"/>).  </t>
      <t pn="section-1-5"> Many applications that are intended to be
served by DetNet require the ability to synchronize the clocks in end systems
to a sub-microsecond accuracy.  Some of the queue-control techniques defined
in <xref target="QueuingModels" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.5"/> also require time synchronization among
network nodes.  The means used to achieve time synchronization are not
addressed in this document.  DetNet can accommodate various
time-synchronization techniques and profiles that are defined elsewhere to
address the needs of different market segments.

        </ul>

            Resource allocation operates by assigning resources, e.g., buffer
            space or link bandwidth, to a DetNet flow (or flow aggregate) along
            its path. Resource allocation greatly reduces, or even eliminates
            entirely, packet loss due to output packet contention within the
            network, but it can only be supplied to a DetNet flow that is limited
            at the source to a maximum packet size and transmission rate. 
			
			As DetNet flows are assumed to be rate limited and DetNet is designed
			to provide sufficient allocated resources (including provisioned
			capacity), the use of transport-layer congestion control 
			<xref target="RFC2914" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2914"/> for App-flows is not required; however,
			if resources are allocated appropriately, use of congestion control
			should not impact transmission negatively. 
			
        </t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-7"> Resource allocation addresses two of the DetNet QoS requirements: latency
and packet loss. Given that DetNet nodes have a finite amount of buffer space,
resource allocation necessarily results in a maximum end-to-end
latency. Resource allocation also addresses contention-related packet loss.
</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-8"> Other important contributions to packet loss are random media errors
and equipment failures.  Service protection is the name for the mechanisms
used by DetNet to address these losses.  The mechanisms employed are
constrained by the need to meet the users' latency requirements. Packet
replication and elimination (<xref target="Seamless" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2.2.2"/>) and packet encoding
(<xref target="PacketEncoding" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2.2.3"/>) are described in this document to provide
service protection, but other mechanisms may also be found. For instance,
packet encoding can be used to provide service protection against random media
errors, while packet replication and elimination can be used to provide
service protection against equipment failures. This mechanism distributes the
contents of DetNet flows over multiple paths in time and/or space, so that the
loss of some of the paths does need not cause the loss of any packets.

results that eight combinations, including none (no DetNet), are
possible. Some combinations, however, are of wider utility than others.  This

supported at all). They may also work only if the critical traffic constitutes only a small portion of
the network's theoretical capacity, if all systems are functioning properly,

       serial-digital cables (or buses) for highly reliable, synchronized, and
       jitter-free communications. While the latency of analog transmissions is
       basically the speed of light, legacy serial links are usually slow (in the

In networks controlled by typical dynamic control protocols such as IS-IS or
OSPF, a network topology event in one part of the network can impact, at least
briefly, the delivery of data in parts of the network remote from the failure
or recovery event. Even the use of redundant paths through a network, e.g., as
defined by <xref target="RFC6372" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6372"/>, does not eliminate the chances of packet
loss. Furthermore, out-of-order packet delivery can be a side effect of route
changes.  </t>
          <t pn="section-3.2.3-2"> Many real-time networks rely on physical rings of two-port
devices, with a relatively simple ring control protocol.  This supports
redundant paths for service protection with a minimum of wiring.  As an
additional benefit, ring topologies can often utilize different topology
management protocols from those used for a mesh network, with a consequent
reduction in the response time to topology changes.  Of course, this comes at
some cost in terms of increased hop count, and thus latency, for the typical
path.  </t>
          <t pn="section-3.2.3-3"> In order to get the advantages of low hop count and still ensure against
even very brief losses of connectivity, DetNet employs explicit routes where
the path taken by a given DetNet flow does not change, at least not
immediately and likely not at all, in response to network topology events.
Service protection (see Sections <xref target="srvcprot" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.2.2"/>
and <xref target="PacketEncoding" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.2.2.3"/>) over explicit routes
provides a high likelihood of continuous connectivity.  Explicit routes can be
established in various ways, e.g., with RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3209"/>, with
Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8402"/>, via a SDN approach <xref target="RFC8453" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8453"/>, with IS-IS <xref target="RFC7813" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7813"/>, etc.  Explicit routes
are typically used in MPLS TE (Traffic Engineering) Label Switched Paths
(LSPs). </t>
          <t pn="section-3.2.3-4"> Out-of-order packet delivery can be a side effect of distributing a single
flow over multiple paths, especially when there is a change from one path to
another when combining the flow. This is irrespective of the distribution
method used and also applies to service protection over explicit routes. As
described in <xref target="inorder" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2.2.1"/>, out-of-order packets influence the
jitter of a flow and impact the amount of buffering needed to process the
data; therefore, the guarantees of a DetNet service include a maximum amount
of misordering as a constraint. The use of explicit routes helps to provide in-order delivery
because there is no immediate route change with the network topology, but the

              A DetNet network supports the dedication of a high proportion of
              the network bandwidth to DetNet flows.  But, no matter how much
              is dedicated for DetNet flows, it is a goal of DetNet to coexist
              with existing Class-of-Service schemes (e.g., DiffServ).  It is
              also important that non-DetNet traffic not disrupt the DetNet

              Robust real-time systems require reducing the number of possible
              failures. Filters and policers should be used in a DetNet
              network to detect if DetNet packets are received on the wrong
              interface, at the wrong time, or in too great a volume.
              Furthermore, filters and policers can take actions to discard
              the offending packets or flows, or trigger shutting down the
              offending flow or the offending interface.  </t>
          <t pn="section-3.3.2-2"> It is also
              essential that filters and service remarking be employed at the

              for DetNet packets and thus impinging on the resources
              allocated to DetNet packets. In particular, sending DetNet
              traffic into networks that have not been provisioned in advance
              to handle that DetNet traffic has to be treated as a fault.  The
              use of egress traffic filters, or equivalent mechanisms, to
              prevent this from happening are strongly recommended at the
              edges of DetNet networks and DetNet supporting networks.  In
              this context, the term 'provisioned' has a broad meaning, e.g.,
              provisioning could be performed via an administrative decision
              that the downstream network has the available capacity to carry
              the DetNet traffic that is being sent into it.  </t>

   			  transport-layer congestion control even if the

   			  congestion control because PREOF can remove

            In some networking scenarios, the end system initially provides a
            DetNet flow encapsulation, which contains all information needed
            by DetNet nodes (e.g., DetNet flow based on the Real-time Transport
            Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/> that is carried over a

            One of the most fundamental differences between different

            nodes.  For example, the basic service can be delivered based on
            an MPLS label or an IP header. This decision impacts the basic
            forwarding logic for the DetNet service sub-layer. Note that in
            both cases, IP addresses are used to address DetNet nodes.  The
            selected DetNet forwarding sub-layer technology also needs to be
            mapped to the subnet technology used to interconnect DetNet
            nodes. For example, DetNet flows will need to be mapped to TSN

                  DetNet flows can be synchronous or asynchronous.
                  In synchronous DetNet flows, at least the DetNet nodes (and possibly
                  the end systems) are closely time
                  synchronized, typically to better than 1 microsecond.  By transmitting
                  packets from different DetNet flows or classes of DetNet flows at different times,
                  using repeating schedules synchronized among the DetNet nodes, resources
                  such as buffers and link bandwidth can be shared over the time domain
                  among different DetNet flows.  There is a trade-off among techniques for
                  synchronous DetNet flows between the burden of fine-grained scheduling and the
                  benefit of reducing the required resources, especially buffer space.

                  among DetNet flows contending for buffer resources.

              system to non-DetNet packets as long as all guarantees are
              fulfilled.  However, making those resources available to DetNet
              packets in other DetNet flows would serve no purpose.  Those
              other DetNet flows have their own dedicated resources, on the

 application to allow it to shift from a special-purpose digital network to an
 Internet Protocol network, one fundamental shift in the behavior of network
 applications is impossible to avoid: the reservation of resources before the
 application starts.  In the first place, a network cannot deliver finite
 latency and practically zero packet loss to an arbitrarily high offered load.
 Secondly, achieving practically zero packet loss for DetNet flows means that
 DetNet nodes have to dedicate buffer resources to specific DetNet flows or to
 classes of DetNet flows.  The requirements of each reservation have to be
 translated into the parameters that control each DetNet system's queuing,
 shaping, and scheduling functions, and they have to be delivered to the DetNet nodes and end

required to deliver a particular DetNet service. If a node itself is not
DetNet service aware, the DetNet nodes that are adjacent to them must ensure
that the node that is non-DetNet aware is provisioned to appropriately support
the DetNet service. For example, a TSN node (as defined by IEEE 802.1) may be used to
interconnect DetNet-aware nodes, and these DetNet nodes can map DetNet flows
to 802.1 TSN flows. As another example, an MPLS-TE or MPLS-TP (Transport Profile) domain may be used to
interconnect DetNet-aware nodes, and these DetNet nodes can map DetNet flows
to TE LSPs, which can provide the QoS requirements of the DetNet service.

      <name slugifiedName="name-security-considerations">Security Considerations</name>
      <t pn="section-5-1">
		  Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail
		  in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-security" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DETNET-SECURITY"/>. This section considers
		  exclusively security considerations that are specific to the
		  DetNet architecture.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-2"> Security aspects that are
		  unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to provide the
		  specific QoS aspects of DetNet, which are
		  primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet
		  loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery latency. A DetNet
		  may be implemented using MPLS and/or IP (including both v4
		  and v6) technologies and thus inherits the security
		  properties of those technologies at both the Data Plane and
		  the Controller Plane.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-3"> Security considerations for
		  DetNet are constrained (compared to, for example, the open
		  Internet) because DetNet is defined to operate only within a
		  single administrative domain (see <xref target="introduction" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 1"/>). The primary
		  considerations are to secure the request and control of
		  DetNet resources, maintain confidentiality of data
		  traversing the DetNet, and provide the availability of the
		  DetNet QoS.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-4"> To secure the request
		  and control of DetNet resources, authentication and
		  authorization can be used for each device connected to a
		  DetNet domain, most importantly to network controller
		  devices. Control of a DetNet network may be centralized or
		  distributed (within a single administrative domain). In the
		  case of centralized control, precedent for security
		  considerations as defined for Abstraction and Control of
		  Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) can be found in <xref target="RFC8453" sectionFormat="of" section="9" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8453#section-9" derivedContent="RFC8453"/>. In the case of distributed
		  control protocols, DetNet security is expected to be
		  provided by the security properties of the protocols in
		  use. In any case, the result is that manipulation of
		  administratively configurable parameters is limited to
		  authorized entities.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-5"> To maintain confidentiality of
		  data traversing the DetNet, application flows can be
		  protected through whatever means is provided by the
		  underlying technology. For example, encryption may be used,
		  such as that provided by IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4301"/>, for
		  IP flows and by MACSec <xref target="IEEE802.1AE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE802.1AE"/> for
		  Ethernet (Layer 2) flows.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-6"> DetNet flows are
		  identified on a per-flow basis, which may provide attackers
		  with additional information about the data flows (when
		  compared to networks that do not include per-flow
		  identification).  This is an inherent property of DetNet
		  that has security implications that should be considered
		  when determining if DetNet is a suitable technology for any
		  given use case.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-7"> To provide uninterrupted
		  availability of the DetNet QoS, provisions
		  can be made against DoS attacks and delay attacks. To
		  protect against DoS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious
		  or malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated, for
		  example, through the use of traffic admission control
		  applied at the input of a DetNet domain as described in
		  <xref target="Zero" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2.1"/> and through the fault-mitigation
		  methods described in <xref target="FaultMitigation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.3.2"/>. To
		  prevent DetNet packets from being delayed by an entity
		  external to a DetNet domain, DetNet technology definition
		  can allow for the mitigation of man-in-the-middle attacks,
		  for example, through use of authentication and authorization
		  of devices within the DetNet domain.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-8"> Because DetNet
		  mechanisms or applications that rely on DetNet can make
		  heavy use of methods that require precise time
		  synchronization, the accuracy, availability, and integrity
		  of time synchronization is of critical importance. Extensive
		  discussion of this topic can be found in <xref target="RFC7384" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7384"/>.  </t>
      <t pn="section-5-9"> DetNet use cases are known to
		  have widely divergent security requirements. The intent of
		  this section is to provide a baseline for security
		  considerations that are common to all DetNet designs and
		  implementations, without burdening individual designs with
		  specifics of security infrastructure that may not be
		  germane to the given use case. Designers and implementors of
		  DetNet systems are expected to take use-case-specific considerations
		  into account in their DetNet designs
		  and implementations.

          <abstract>
            <t>A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real- time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.  Deterministic networks have been successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years (for example [ARINC664P7]).  However, such networks are typically isolated from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low.  IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into contact with Information Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft).  These DetNet technologies have not previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present security considerations that may be new to IP- based wide area network designers.  This draft, intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security considerations.  In addition, this draft collects all security- related statements from the various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into a single location Section 8.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs) in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).  Since the flow along an LSP is completely identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may be treated as tunnels.  A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

          <abstract>
            <t>Network survivability is the ability of a network to recover traffic delivery following failure or degradation of network resources.  Survivability is critical for the delivery of guaranteed network services, such as those subject to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that place maximum bounds on the length of time that services may be degraded or unavailable.</t>
            <t>The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS data plane that reuses many aspects of the MPLS management and control planes.</t>
            <t>This document comprises a framework for the provision of survivability in an MPLS-TP network; it describes recovery elements, types, methods, and topological considerations.  To enable data-plane recovery, survivability may be supported by the control plane, management plane, and by Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions. This document describes mechanisms for recovering MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  A detailed description of pseudowire recovery in MPLS-TP networks is beyond the scope of this document.</t>
            <t>This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet-based transport network as defined by the ITU-T.  </t>

This document aims to clarify the SDN landscape by providing a perspective on requirements, issues, and other considerations about SDN, as seen from within a service provider environment.</t>
            <t>It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used under an SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.  As such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open interfaces.  SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what the layer structure is in an SDN architecture, and how layers interface with each other.  This document, a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise reference for the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation.  As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.  There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
            <t>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations.  The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

            <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments".  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.  A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain.  SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.</t>
            <t>SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  The segment to process is on the top of the stack.  Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.</t>
            <t>SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.  The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane.  They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.  These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.  The term "Traffic Engineered network" refers to a network that uses any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity.</t>
            <t>Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources.</t>
            <t>This document provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network services and connectivity services.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in common a need for "deterministic flows".  "Deterministic" in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.</t>
