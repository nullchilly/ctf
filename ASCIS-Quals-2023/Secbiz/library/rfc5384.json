Each tree is identified by the combination\r\nof a multicast group address and a source address (where the source\r\naddress is possibly a \"wild card\").  Under certain conditions it can\r\nbe useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional information\r\nrelated to the construction of the tree.  However, there has been no\r\nway to do so until now.  This document\r\ndescribes a modification of the Join message that allows a node to\r\nassociate attributes with a particular tree.  The attributes are\r\nencoded in Type-Length-Value format.
