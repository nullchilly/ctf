The Reed-Solomon codes considered have\r\nattractive properties, since they offer optimal protection against\r\npacket erasures and the source symbols are part of the encoding\r\nsymbols, which can greatly simplify decoding.  However, the price to\r\npay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum\r\nnumber of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher\r\nthan that of the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, for instance.","pub_date":"February 2013","keywords":["Forward Error Correction","Reed-Solomon"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6865","errata_url":null}
