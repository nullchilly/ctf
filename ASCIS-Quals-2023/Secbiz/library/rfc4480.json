This format\r\ndefines a textual note, an indication of availability (open or\r\nclosed) and a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for communication.\r\nThe Rich Presence Information Data format (RPID) described here is an\r\nextension that adds optional elements to the Presence Information\r\nData Format (PIDF).  These extensions provide additional information\r\nabout the presentity and its contacts.  The information is designed\r\nso that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar\r\nfiles or user activity.\r\n\r\nThis extension includes information about what the person is doing, a\r\ngrouping identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last\r\nused, the type of place a person is in, what media communications\r\nmight remain private, the relationship of a service tuple to another\r\npresentity, the person's mood, the time zone it is located in, the\r\ntype of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's\r\nstatus, and the overall role of the presentity.\r\n\r\nThese extensions include presence information for persons, services\r\n(tuples), and devices.
