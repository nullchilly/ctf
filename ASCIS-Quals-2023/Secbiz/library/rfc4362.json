The profile is built as an extension to\r\nthe ROHC RTP profile.  It defines additional mechanisms needed in\r\nROHC, states requirements on the assisting layer to guarantee\r\ntransparency, and specifies general logic for compression and\r\ndecompression related to the usage of the header-free packet\r\nformat.  This document is a replacement for RFC 3242, which it\r\nobsoletes.
