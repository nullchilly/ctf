The UA might want to\r\nprotect the message bodies and\/or headers from intermediaries, except\r\nthose that provide services based on its content.  This situation\r\nrequires a mechanism called \"end-to-middle security\" to secure the\r\ninformation passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not\r\ninterfere with end-to-end security.  This document defines a set of\r\nrequirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2005","keywords":["user agent","ua","intermediaries"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4189","errata_url":null}
