In many remote access scenarios, a mechanism for making the remote host appear to be present on the local corporate network is quite useful.  This may be accomplished by assigning the host a \"virtual\" address from the corporate network, and then tunneling traffic via IPsec from the host's ISP-assigned address to the corporate security gateway.  In IPv4, DHCP provides for such remote host configuration.
