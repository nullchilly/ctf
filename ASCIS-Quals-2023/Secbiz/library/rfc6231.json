The package defines dialog management\r\nrequest elements for preparing, starting, and terminating dialog\r\ninteractions, as well as associated responses and notifications.\r\nDialog interactions are specified in a dialog language.  This package\r\ndefines a lightweight IVR dialog language (supporting prompt\r\nplayback, runtime controls, Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)\r\ncollection, and media recording) and allows other dialog languages to\r\nbe used.  The package also defines elements for auditing package\r\ncapabilities and IVR dialogs.
