One example is a resource list service.  If a user sends a\r\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) SUBSCRIBE message to the URI\r\nrepresenting the resource list service, the server will obtain the\r\nstate of the users in the associated group, and provide it to the\r\nsender.  To facilitate definition of these services, this\r\nspecification defines two Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents.\r\nOne document contains service URIs, along with their service\r\ndefinition and a reference to the associated group of users.  The\r\nsecond document contains the user lists that are referenced from the\r\nfirst.  This list of users can be utilized by other applications and\r\nservices.  Both documents can be created and managed with the XML\r\nConfiguration Access Protocol (XCAP).
