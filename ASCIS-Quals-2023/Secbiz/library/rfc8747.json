Being able to prove\r\npossession of a key is also sometimes described as being the\r\nholder-of-key. This specification provides equivalent functionality\r\nto \"Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\"\r\n(RFC 7800) but using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and\r\nCWTs rather than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and JSON Web\r\nTokens (JWTs).","pub_date":"March 2020","keywords":["CBOR Web Token","CWT","Proof-of-Possession","Holder-of-Key"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8747","errata_url":null}
