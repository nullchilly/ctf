It is\r\nexpected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG\r\nmodules defining data models for control-plane protocols, route\r\nfilters, and other functions.  The core routing data model provides\r\ncommon building blocks for such extensions -- routes, Routing\r\nInformation Bases (RIBs), and control-plane protocols.\r\n\r\nThe YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management\r\nDatastore Architecture (NMDA).
