The Encapsulating\r\nSecurity Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) provide\r\ntwo mechanisms for protecting data being sent over an IPsec Security\r\nAssociation (SA).  To ensure interoperability between disparate\r\nimplementations, it is necessary to specify a set of\r\nmandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one\r\nalgorithm that all implementations will have available.  This document\r\ndefines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP\r\nand AH as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented\r\nbecause they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.
