The extensions focus on the use of\r\npublic-key-based identifiers discovered via DNS resolution, but\r\nalso define interfaces for manual bindings between Host Identity Tags\r\n(HITs) and locators.  With the extensions, the application can also support\r\nmore relaxed security models where communication can be non-HIP-based,\r\naccording to local policies.  The extensions in this document are\r\nexperimental and provide basic tools for further experimentation with\r\npolicies.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["host identity tag","cryptographic identity","cryptographic namespace","sockets API","Shim6","opportunistic mode","resolver","HIP wildcard address","ORCHID","source address selection","HIT prefix","locator handling"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6317","errata_url":null}
