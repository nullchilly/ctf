Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was\r\npublished in 2007, security and efficiency have been rigorously\r\nevaluated through academic and industrial studies.  As of the\r\npublication of this document, no security vulnerabilities have been\r\nfound.  KCipher-2 offers fast encryption and decryption by means of\r\nsimple operations that enable efficient implementation.  KCipher-2\r\nhas been used for industrial applications, especially for mobile\r\nhealth monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.","pub_date":"August 2013","keywords":["encryption","stream cipher","cipher"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7008","errata_url":null}
