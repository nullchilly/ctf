A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\r\nclient that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and\r\nSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the\r\nnext.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes\r\nwith one command, limiting the delays caused by many round trips and\r\nnot requiring disruption of the currently selected mailbox.  This\r\nextension also uses MAILBOX, UIDVALIDITY, and TAG fields in ESEARCH\r\nresponses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.\r\nThis document updates RFC 4466 and obsoletes RFC 6237.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["IMAP","email","search","multiple mailboxes","imapext"],"obsoletes":["RFC6237"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4466"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7377","errata_url":null}
