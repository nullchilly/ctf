Structured\r\nbusiness data may be XML; Electronic Data Interchange\r\n(EDI) in either the American National Standards Committee (ANSI)\r\nX12 format or the UN Electronic Data Interchange for\r\nAdministration, Commerce, and Transport (UN\/EDIFACT) format;\r\nor other structured data formats.  The data is packaged using\r\nstandard MIME structures.  Authentication and data confidentiality\r\nare obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax with S\/MIME\r\nsecurity body parts.  Authenticated acknowledgements make use of\r\nmultipart\/signed Message Disposition Notification (MDN)\r\nresponses to the original HTTP message.  This applicability\r\nstatement is informally referred to as \"AS2\" because it is the\r\nsecond applicability statement, produced after \"AS1\", RFC 3335.
