In its current\r\nform, it allows session invitations, instant messages, and other\r\nrequests to be delivered from one party to another without requiring\r\nexplicit consent of the recipient.  Without such consent, it is\r\npossible for SIP to be used for malicious purposes, including\r\namplification and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  This document\r\nidentifies a framework for consent-based communications in SIP. \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8217"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5360","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5360"}
