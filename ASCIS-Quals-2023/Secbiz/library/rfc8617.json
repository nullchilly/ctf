As messages\r\ntraverse ARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers, additional ARC assertions\r\ncan be attached to messages to form ordered sets of ARC assertions\r\nthat represent the authentication assessment at each step of the\r\nmessage-handling paths.\r\n\r\nARC-enabled Internet Mail Handlers can process sets of ARC assertions\r\nto inform message disposition decisions, identify Internet Mail\r\nHandlers that might break existing authentication mechanisms, and\r\nconvey original authentication assessments across trust boundaries.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":["DKIM","DMARC","signature","email","domian authentication","email authentication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8617","errata_url":null}
