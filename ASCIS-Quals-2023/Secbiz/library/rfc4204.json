Furthermore, the\r\nmanagement of TE links is not restricted to in-band messaging, but\r\ninstead can be done using out-of-band techniques.  This document\r\nspecifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs between a pair\r\nof nodes and is used to manage TE links.  Specifically, LMP will be\r\nused to maintain control channel connectivity, verify the physical\r\nconnectivity of the data links, correlate the link property\r\ninformation, suppress downstream alarms, and localize link failures\r\nfor protection\/restoration purposes in multiple kinds of networks.
