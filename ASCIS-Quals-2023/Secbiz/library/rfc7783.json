Appointed Forwarders provide\r\nVLAN-based load sharing with an active-standby model.\r\nHigh-performance applications require an active-active\r\nload-sharing model.  The active-active load-sharing model can be\r\naccomplished by representing any given non-TRILL network with a\r\nsingle virtual RBridge (also referred to as a virtual Routing Bridge\r\nor virtual TRILL switch).  Virtual representation of the non-TRILL\r\nnetwork with a single RBridge poses serious challenges in\r\nmulti-destination RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations.\r\nThis document specifies required enhancements to build Coordinated\r\nMulticast Trees (CMT) within the TRILL campus to solve related RPF\r\nissues.  CMT, which only requires a software upgrade, provides\r\nflexibility to RBridges in selecting a desired path of association to\r\na given TRILL multi-destination distribution tree.
