The existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the\r\nexpansion of PLC deployments due to its potential advantages in terms\r\nof cost and convenience.  Moreover, a wide variety of accessible\r\ndevices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.\r\nThis document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over\r\nconstrained PLC networks, such as those described in ITU-T G.9903,\r\nIEEE 1901.1, and IEEE 1901.2.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":["6lo","6lowpan","6lo-plc","6loplc","plc"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9354","errata_url":null}
