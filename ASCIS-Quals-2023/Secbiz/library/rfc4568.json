The attribute\r\ndescribes a cryptographic key and other parameters that serve to\r\nconfigure security for a unicast media stream in either a single\r\nmessage or a roundtrip exchange.  The attribute can be used with a\r\nvariety of SDP media transports, and this document defines how to use\r\nit for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) unicast media\r\nstreams.  The SDP crypto attribute requires the services of a data\r\nsecurity protocol to secure the SDP message.
