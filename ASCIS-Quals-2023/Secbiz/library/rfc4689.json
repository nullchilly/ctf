The terminology is to be applied to\r\nmeasurements made on the data plane to evaluate IP traffic control\r\nmechanisms.  Rules for packet classification can be based on any\r\nfield in the IP header, such as the Differentiated Services Code Point\r\n(DSCP), or any field in the packet payload, such as port number.
