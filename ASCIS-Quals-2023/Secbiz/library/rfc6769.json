This document describes\r\na technique, Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA), that allows some BGP routers\r\nnot to install all of those routes into the Forwarding Information Base (FIB).\r\n\r\nSome routers in an Autonomous System (AS) announce an aggregate (the\r\nVA prefix) in addition to the routes they already announce.  This\r\nenables other routers not to install the routes covered by the VA\r\nprefix into the FIB as long as those routes have the same next-hop as\r\nthe VA prefix.\r\n\r\nThe VA prefixes that are announced within an AS are not announced to\r\nany other AS.  The described functionality is of very low operational\r\ncomplexity, as it proposes a confined BGP speaker solution without any\r\ndependency on network-wide configuration or requirement for any form\r\nof intra-domain tunneling.
