TRILL\r\naccomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate\r\nSystem) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a\r\nheader that includes a hop count.  Devices that implement TRILL are\r\ncalled \"RBridges\" (Routing Bridges).\r\n\r\nTRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can\r\nhave multiple end stations and RBridges attached.  Where multiple\r\nRBridges are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end\r\nstations on that link is handled by a subset of those RBridges called\r\n\"Appointed Forwarders\", with the intent that native traffic in each\r\nVLAN (Virtual LAN) be handled by at most one RBridge.  The purpose of\r\nthis document is to improve the documentation of the Appointed\r\nForwarder mechanism; thus, it updates RFC 6325.
