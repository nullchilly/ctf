This document describes PCEP extensions for\r\nauto-bandwidth adjustment when employing an active stateful PCE for\r\nboth PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["Bandwidth optimization","PCEP Overwhelm","LSP re-optimization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8733","errata_url":null}
