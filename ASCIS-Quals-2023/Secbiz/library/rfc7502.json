Terminology\r\nrelated to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion\r\nterminology document (RFC 7501).  Using these two documents,\r\nbenchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of\r\ndevices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border\r\nControllers.  The term \"performance\" in this context means the\r\ncapacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages.\r\nMedia streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling\r\nbehavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized\r\nset of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity\r\nof SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are\r\nnecessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and\r\noperational conditions that can influence performance benchmark\r\nmeasurements.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7502","errata_url":null}
