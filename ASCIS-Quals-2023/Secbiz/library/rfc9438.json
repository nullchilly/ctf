CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP\r\ncongestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks.\r\n\r\nThis document updates the specification of CUBIC to include\r\nalgorithmic improvements based on these implementations and recent\r\nacademic work. Based on the extensive deployment experience with\r\nCUBIC, this document also moves the specification to the Standards\r\nTrack and obsoletes RFC 8312. This document also updates RFC 5681, to\r\nallow for CUBIC's occasionally more aggressive sending behavior.","pub_date":"August 2023","keywords":["Congestion control","large BDP","window scalability","RTT fairness"],"obsoletes":["RFC8312"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5681"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9438","errata_url":null}
