This document describes the use of authenticated\r\nencryption algorithms with the Encrypted Payload of the Internet Key\r\nExchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.\r\n\r\nThe use of two specific authenticated encryption algorithms with the\r\nIKEv2 Encrypted Payload is also described; these two algorithms are\r\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois\/Counter Mode (AES\r\nGCM) and AES in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (AES CCM).  Additional\r\ndocuments may describe the use of other authenticated encryption\r\nalgorithms with the IKEv2 Encrypted Payload.
