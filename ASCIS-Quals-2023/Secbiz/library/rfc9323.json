The objective is to allow for the creation of an\r\nattestation, termed an \"RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC)\", which contains\r\none or more checksums of arbitrary digital objects (files) that are\r\nsigned with a specific set of Internet Number Resources. When\r\nvalidated, an RSC confirms that the respective Internet resource\r\nholder produced the RSC.","pub_date":"November 2022","keywords":["security","cryptography","X.509"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9323","errata_url":null}
