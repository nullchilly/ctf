Some of this shared\r\nstate is vital for operation, but may be volatile in nature,\r\nsuch as packet sequence numbers used on the L2TP Control\r\nConnection.  When failure of one side of a control connection occurs, a\r\nnew control connection is created and associated with the old\r\nconnection by exchanging information about the old connection.  Such a\r\nmechanism is not intended as a replacement for an active fail over\r\nwith some mirrored connection states, but as an aid for those\r\nparameters that are particularly difficult to have immediately\r\navailable.  Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this document are\r\nintended to facilitate state recovery, providing additional resiliency\r\nin an L2TP network, and improving a remote system's layer 2\r\nconnectivity.
