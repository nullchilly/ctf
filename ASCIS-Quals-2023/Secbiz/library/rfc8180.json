This minimal mode\r\nof operation specifies the baseline set of protocols that need to be\r\nsupported and the recommended configurations and modes of operation\r\nsufficient to enable a 6TiSCH functional network.  6TiSCH provides\r\nIPv6 connectivity over a Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mesh\r\ncomposed of IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH links.  This minimal mode uses a\r\ncollection of protocols with the respective configurations, including\r\nthe IPv6 Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN)\r\nframework, enabling interoperable IPv6 connectivity over IEEE Std\r\n802.15.4 TSCH.  This minimal configuration provides the necessary\r\nbandwidth for network and security bootstrapping and defines the\r\nproper link between the IETF protocols that interface to IEEE Std\r\n802.15.4 TSCH.  This minimal mode of operation should be implemented\r\nby all 6TiSCH-compliant devices.","pub_date":"May 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0210"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8180","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8180"}
