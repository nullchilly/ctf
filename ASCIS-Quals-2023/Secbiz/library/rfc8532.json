The data model is defined using the\r\nYANG data modeling language, as specified in RFC 7950.  It provides a\r\ntechnology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM\r\nprotocols that use connectionless communication.  The base model\r\npresented here can be extended to include technology-specific\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThere are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to\r\nuniformity between OAM protocols.  Second, it supports both nested\r\nOAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level or\r\ndifferent levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive\r\nOAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same level\r\nthrough a unified interface).","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8532","errata_url":null}
