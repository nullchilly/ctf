In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the\r\ntransit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities\r\nwithin the network.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches)\r\nprovide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches need\r\nto explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do\r\nnot allow users to manage resource usage policies for content in the\r\ncache.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network\r\nstorage for P2P applications and shows the need for a standard\r\nprotocol for accessing this storage.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":["In-network storage","P2P"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6646","errata_url":null}
