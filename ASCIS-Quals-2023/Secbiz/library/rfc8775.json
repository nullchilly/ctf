One of the\r\nresponsibilities of the Designated Router is to track local multicast\r\nlisteners and forward data to these listeners if the group is\r\noperating in PIM-SM. This document specifies a modification to the\r\nPIM-SM protocol that allows more than one of the PIM-SM routers to\r\ntake on this responsibility so that the forwarding load can be\r\ndistributed among multiple routers.","pub_date":"April 2020","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8775","errata_url":null}
