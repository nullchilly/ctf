Kelly"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"28","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force\r\nattacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed\r\nadversary.  As a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the\r\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications\r\ncontinue to rely on DES for security, and designers and implementers\r\ncontinue to support it in new applications.  While this is not always\r\ninappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security\r\nimplications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all\r\nthe information they need to make judicious decisions regarding its\r\nuse.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2006","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4772","errata_url":null}
