Such services include network announcements, user\r\ninteraction, and conferencing services.  These services are basic\r\nbuilding blocks, from which one can construct interesting\r\napplications.  In order to have interoperability between servers\r\noffering these building blocks (also known as Media Servers) and\r\napplication developers, one needs to be able to locate and invoke\r\nsuch services in a well defined manner.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a mechanism for providing an interoperable\r\ninterface between Application Servers, which provide application\r\nservices to SIP-based networks, and Media Servers, which provide the\r\nbasic media processing building blocks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["session initiation protocol","network media services","media servers","application servers"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4240","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4240"}
