Unfortunately, spam is not limited to email.\r\nIt can affect any system that enables user-to-user communications.\r\nThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines a system for user-to-\r\nuser multimedia communications.  Therefore, it is susceptible to\r\nspam, just as email is.  In this document, we analyze the problem of\r\nspam in SIP.  We first identify the ways in which the problem is the\r\nsame and the ways in which it is different from email.  We then\r\nexamine the various possible solutions that have been discussed for\r\nemail and consider their applicability to SIP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2008","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5039","errata_url":null}
