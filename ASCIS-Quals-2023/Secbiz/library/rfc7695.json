Used in conjunction with a protocol that provides\r\nflooding of information among a set of participating nodes, prefix\r\nconfiguration within a network may be automated.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["distributed","prefix","address","assignment","homenet"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7695","errata_url":null}
