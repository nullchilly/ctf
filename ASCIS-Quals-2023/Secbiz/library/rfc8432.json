Some\r\nparts of the resulting model may be generic and could also be used by\r\nother technologies, e.g., Ethernet technology.","pub_date":"October 2018","keywords":["Microwave","millimeter waves","YANG Model","interface management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8432","errata_url":null}
