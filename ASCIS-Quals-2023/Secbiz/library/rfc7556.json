It outlines a solution framework for some\r\nof the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple\r\nnetworks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a\r\nProvisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network\r\nconfiguration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific\r\ninformation from the networks they are attached to and\/or other\r\nsources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration\r\nconsistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7556","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7556"}
