This mapping occurs as part of the process of\r\nrouting emergency calls through the IP network.\r\n\r\nBased on the identified threats, this document establishes a set of\r\nsecurity requirements for the mapping protocol and for the handling\r\nof emergency-marked calls.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2008","keywords":["ecrit","public safety answering points","pasp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5069","errata_url":null}
