This is in accordance with the guidelines for\r\nauthorization extensions as specified in RFC 5878.  As with other TLS\r\nextensions, this authorization data can be included in the client and\r\nserver hello messages to confirm that both parties support the\r\ndesired authorization data types.  If supported by both the client\r\nand the server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental\r\ndata TLS handshake message as specified in RFC 4680.  This\r\nauthorization data type extension is in support of devices containing\r\nDTCP certificates issued by the Digital Transmission Licensing\r\nAdministrator (DTLA).","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["Transport Layer Security","TLS","SupplementalData","DTCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8996"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7562","errata_url":null}
