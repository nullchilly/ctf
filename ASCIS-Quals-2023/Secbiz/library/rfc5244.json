It supersedes and adds to the original assignment\r\nof event codes for this purpose in Section 3.14 of RFC 2833.  As\r\ndocumented in Appendix A of RFC 4733, some of the RFC 2833 events have\r\nbeen deprecated because their specification was ambiguous, erroneous,\r\nor redundant.  In fact, the degree of change from Section 3.14 of RFC\r\n2833 is such that implementations of the present document\r\nwill be fully backward compatible with RFC 2833 implementations only\r\nin the case of full ABCD-bit signalling.  This document expands and\r\nimproves the coverage of signalling systems compared to RFC 2833.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2008","keywords":["[--------]","event code","telephony event rtp payload"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4733"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5244","errata_url":null}
