The\r\npath-computation response from a PCE helps the PCC to gracefully\r\nestablish the computed LSP.\r\n\r\nThe Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture allows\r\nthe optimum sequence of interconnected domains to be selected and\r\nnetwork policy to be applied if applicable, via the use of a\r\nhierarchical relationship between PCEs.\r\n\r\nCombining the capabilities of stateful PCE and the hierarchical PCE\r\nwould be advantageous. This document describes general considerations\r\nand use cases for the deployment of stateful, but not stateless, PCEs\r\nusing the hierarchical PCE architecture.","pub_date":"March 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8751","errata_url":null}
