Begen"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"31","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"FEC Framework","abstract":"This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error\r\nCorrection (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code\r\nfrom a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity\r\ncode is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are\r\ngenerated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow\r\nseparate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The\r\n1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty\r\npacket losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload\r\nformat defined in this document should only be used (with some\r\nexceptions) as a part of the Digital Video Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB-\r\nIPTV) Application-layer FEC specification.
