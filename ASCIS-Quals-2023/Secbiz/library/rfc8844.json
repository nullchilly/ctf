Similar attacks are described on the use of\r\nDTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time\r\nCommunications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are\r\ndifficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the\r\nidentity of a communicating peer.  This document defines mitigation\r\ntechniques that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["Unknown Key-Share Attack","SDP","DTLS-SRTP","WebRTC","SIP identity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8122"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8844","errata_url":null}
