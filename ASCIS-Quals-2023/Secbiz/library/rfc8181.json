Even though the RPKI will have many\r\nparticipants issuing certificates and creating other objects, it is\r\noperationally useful to consolidate the publication of those objects.\r\nEven in cases where a certificate issuer runs its own publication\r\nrepository, it can be useful to run the certificate engine itself on\r\na different machine from the publication repository.  This document\r\ndefines a protocol which addresses these needs.","pub_date":"July 2017","keywords":["SIDR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8181","errata_url":null}
