They are intended to provide\r\nprotocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in\r\nfuture-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes\r\nformats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with\r\nnotes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the\r\nDelay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by\r\nthat group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised. \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["SDNV","DTN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6256","errata_url":null}
