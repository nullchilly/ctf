The use of PCE in MPLS networks is\r\nalready established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimes\r\ncomplex to compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs.\r\n\r\nGeneric requirements for a communication protocol between Path\r\nComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, \"Path\r\nComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic\r\nRequirements\".  This document complements the generic requirements and\r\npresents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol\r\nrequirements for point-to-multipoint MPLS\/GMPLS traffic engineering.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2010","keywords":["mpls","gmpls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5862","errata_url":null}
