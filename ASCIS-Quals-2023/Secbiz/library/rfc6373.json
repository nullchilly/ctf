This\r\ndocument provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning\r\nand covers control-plane addressing, routing, path computation,\r\nsignaling, traffic engineering, and path recovery.  MPLS-TP uses\r\nGMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths\r\n(LSPs).  MPLS-TP also uses the pseudowire (PW) control plane for\r\npseudowires.  Management-plane functions are out of scope of\r\nthis document.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) \/ International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\r\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\r\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\r\n(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\r\nof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.\r\n\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6373","errata_url":null}
