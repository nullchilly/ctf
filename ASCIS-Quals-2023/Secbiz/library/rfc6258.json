This Metadata\r\nExtension Block is designed to carry additional information that DTN\r\nnodes can use to make processing decisions regarding bundles, such as\r\ndeciding whether to store a bundle or determining to which nodes to\r\nforward a bundle.  The metadata that is carried in a metadata block\r\nmust be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified\r\nin the block's metadata type field.  One specific metadata type, for\r\ncarrying URIs as metadata, is defined in this document.  Other\r\nmetadata types may be defined in separate documents.  This document\r\nis a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has\r\nbeen reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an\r\nRFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["DTN","Delay-Tolerant Networking","Distruption-Tolerant Networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6258","errata_url":null}
