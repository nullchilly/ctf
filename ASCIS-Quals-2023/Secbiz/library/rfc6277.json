This may lead to\r\navoidable interoperability failures in contexts where multiple\r\nsignature algorithms are in use.  This document specifies rules for\r\nserver signature algorithm selection and an extension that allows a\r\nclient to advise a server that specific signature algorithms are\r\nsupported.
