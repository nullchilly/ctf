In some of these\r\ntechnologies, network elements and links may impose additional\r\nrouting constraints such as asymmetric switch connectivity, non-\r\nlocal label assignment, and label range limitations on links.  This\r\ndocument describes Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol\r\nextensions to support these kinds of constraints under the control\r\nof GMPLS.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["WSON","Optical Routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7580","errata_url":null}
