This memo updates the\r\nIP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework, RFC 2330, with advanced\r\nconsiderations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing\r\nframework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a\r\nsingle test stream will represent the characteristics of the path\r\nwhen it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and\r\ntest stream descriptions must evolve with them; otherwise, unexpected\r\nnetwork features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo\r\ndescribes new stream parameters for both network characterization and\r\nsupport of application design using IPPM metrics.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":["Measurement","Wireless","Reactive","Repeatability","Continuity","Actionable","Conservative","Spatial Composition","Temporal Composition"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2330"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7312","errata_url":null}
