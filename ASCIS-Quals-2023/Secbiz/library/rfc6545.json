Service\r\nproviders and Computer Security Incident Response Teams need to be\r\nequipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security\r\nincidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of\r\nan attack.  Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a\r\nproactive inter-network communication method to facilitate sharing\r\nincident-handling data while integrating existing detection, tracing,\r\nsource identification, and mitigation mechanisms for a complete\r\nincident-handling solution.  Combining these capabilities in a\r\ncommunication system provides a way to achieve higher security levels\r\non networks.  Policy guidelines for handling incidents are\r\nrecommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security\r\nrecommendations and considerations.  This document obsoletes RFC\r\n6045.
