These services in-turn provide transport for a\r\nvariety of client networks, e.g., IP and MPLS.  This document uses\r\nprocedures defined in the existing IETF specifications of Ethernet\r\npseudowires carried over MPLS networks.\r\n\r\nMany of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms\r\nexplained in this document are also recognized by the MPLS transport\r\nprofile (MPLS-TP) design effort formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T.\r\nThe solution described here does not address all of the MPLS-TP\r\nrequirements, but it provides a viable form of packet transport\r\nservice using tools that are already available.\r\n\r\nThis document also serves as an indication that existing MPLS\r\ntechniques form an appropriate basis for the design of a fully-\r\nfeatured packet transport solution addressing all of the requirements\r\nof MPLS-TP.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["mpls-tp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5994","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5994"}
