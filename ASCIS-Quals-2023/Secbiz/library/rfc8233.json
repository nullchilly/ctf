These metrics are\r\nassociated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers\r\nand service providers.  The link bandwidth utilization (the total\r\nbandwidth of a link in actual use for the forwarding) is another\r\nimportant factor to consider during path computation.\r\n\r\nIGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions describe mechanisms\r\nwith which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and\r\nIS-IS, respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication\r\nProtocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements\r\n(PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation\r\nClient (PCC) requests.  This document describes the extension to PCEP\r\nto carry latency, delay variation, packet loss, and link bandwidth\r\nutilization as constraints for end-to-end path computation.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["PCE","PCEP","service-aware","metric","BU","LBU","LRBU"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8233","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8233"}
