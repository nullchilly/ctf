When\r\nthose records change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning\r\nthe updated results when polled, as long as the polling rate is not\r\ntoo high. But, there exists no mechanism for a client to be\r\nasynchronously notified when these changes occur.  This document\r\ndefines a mechanism for a client to be notified of such changes to\r\nDNS records, called DNS Push Notifications.","pub_date":"June 2020","keywords":["dns","update","push","notification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8765","errata_url":null}
