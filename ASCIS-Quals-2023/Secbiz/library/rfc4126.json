MAR performance is analyzed\r\nrelative to the criteria for selecting a Bandwidth Constraints Model, in\r\norder to provide guidance to user implementation of the model in their\r\nnetworks.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2005","keywords":["diffserv-enabled mpls traffic engineering","ds-te","mar","bandwidth reservation","bandwidth allocation","bandwidth protection","performance evaluation","cac","network model"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4126","errata_url":null}
