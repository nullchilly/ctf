It extends the ALTO cost information\r\nservice so that applications decide not only 'where' to connect but\r\nalso 'when'.  This is useful for applications that need to perform\r\nbulk data transfer and would like to schedule these transfers during\r\nan off-peak hour, for example.  This extension introduces the ALTO\r\nCost Calendar with which an ALTO Server exposes ALTO cost values in\r\nJSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval. \r\nThe time intervals, as well as other Calendar attributes, are\r\nspecified in the Information Resources Directory and ALTO Server\r\nresponses.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8896","errata_url":null}
