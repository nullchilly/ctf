One of the key\r\ngoals of Seamless MPLS is to meet requirements specific to access\r\nnetworks including high number of devices, device position in network\r\ntopology, and compute and memory constraints that limit the amount of\r\nstate access devices can hold.  This can be achieved with LDP\r\nDownstream-on-Demand (DoD) label advertisement.  This document\r\ndescribes LDP DoD use cases and lists required LDP DoD procedures in\r\nthe context of Seamless MPLS design.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new optional TLV type in the LDP Label Request message\r\nis defined for fast-up convergence.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7032","errata_url":null}
