LCAS can be used for hitless dynamic\r\nresizing of the inverse multiplex group.  These techniques apply to\r\nOptical Transport Network (OTN), Synchronous Optical Network\r\n(SONET), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), and Plesiochronous\r\nDigital Hierarchy (PDH) signals.  This document updates RFC 4606 by\r\nmaking modifications to the procedures for supporting virtual\r\nconcatenation.
