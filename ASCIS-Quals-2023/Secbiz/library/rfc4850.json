This document describes a Public Extension Key for the\r\npurpose of enhancing iSCSI supportability.  The key accomplishes this\r\nobjective by allowing iSCSI nodes to communicate architecture details\r\nduring the iSCSI login sequence.  The receiving node can then use\r\nthis information for enhanced logging and support.  This document\r\nupdates RFC 3720 to allow iSCSI extension items to be defined by\r\nstandards track RFCs and experimental RFCs in addition to\r\ninformational RFCs.
