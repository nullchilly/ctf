These algorithms may be used as the basis for\r\ndata origin authentication and integrity verification mechanisms for\r\nthe Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),\r\nInternet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE), and IKEv2 protocols, and also\r\nas Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs) for IKE and IKEv2.  Truncated\r\noutput lengths are specified for the authentication-related variants,\r\nwith the corresponding algorithms designated as HMAC-SHA-256-128,\r\nHMAC-SHA-384-192, and HMAC-SHA-512-256.  The PRF variants are not\r\ntruncated, and are called PRF-HMAC-SHA-256, PRF-HMAC-SHA-384, and\r\nPRF-HMAC-SHA-512.
