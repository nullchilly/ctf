Currently, fundamental features\r\nof HTTP-level authentication are insufficient for complex\r\nrequirements of various Web-based applications.  This forces these\r\napplications to implement their own authentication frameworks by\r\nmeans such as HTML forms, which becomes one of the hurdles against\r\nintroducing secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by\r\nservers and user agents.  The extended framework fills gaps between\r\nWeb application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to\r\nsolve the above problems, while maintaining compatibility with\r\nexisting Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentication.","pub_date":"January 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8053","errata_url":null}
