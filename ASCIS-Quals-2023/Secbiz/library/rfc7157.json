For\r\nIPv6 hosts, one approach could be the use of IPv6-to-IPv6 Network\r\nPrefix Translation (NPTv6).  However, NAT and NPTv6 should be\r\navoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent end-to-end\r\nconnectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of\r\nmultihoming.  We also describe functional requirements and possible\r\nsolutions for multihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts\r\nand small IPv6 networks that would otherwise be unable to meet\r\nminimum IPv6-allocation criteria.  We conclude that DHCPv6-based\r\nsolutions are suitable to solve the multihoming issues described in\r\nthis document, but NPTv6 may be required as an intermediate solution.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["NPTv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7157","errata_url":null}
