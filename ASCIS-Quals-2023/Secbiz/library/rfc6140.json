In order to function properly, this\r\nmechanism requires that each of the Addresses of Record (AORs)\r\nregistered in bulk map to a unique set of contacts.  This requirement\r\nis satisfied by AORs representing phone numbers regardless of the\r\ndomain, since phone numbers are fully qualified and globally unique.\r\nThis document therefore focuses on this use case.
