The algorithms\r\nspecify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)\r\nimplementations.  They do not override choices made by applications\r\nor upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of\r\nmore advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms\r\nshare a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing\r\nadministrators to provide policy that can override the default\r\nbehavior.  In dual-stack implementations, the destination address\r\nselection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses --\r\ndepending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might\r\nprefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nDefault address selection as defined in this specification applies to\r\nall IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers.
