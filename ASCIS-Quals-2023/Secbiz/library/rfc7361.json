The procedure also removes MAC addresses in the\r\nVPLS that do not require relearning due to such topology changes.\r\nThis document defines an enhancement to the MAC address withdraw\r\nprocedure with an empty MAC list (RFC 4762); this enhancement enables\r\na Provider Edge (PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses that need\r\nto be relearned.  Additional extensions to RFC 4762 MAC withdraw\r\nprocedures are specified to provide an optimized MAC flushing for the\r\nProvider Backbone Bridging (PBB) VPLS specified in RFC 7041.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["MAC flush message","MAC Flush TLV","MAC flushing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7361","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7361"}
