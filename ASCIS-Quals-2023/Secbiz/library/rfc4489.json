The extension allows the use of\r\nInterface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.  When a\r\nlink-local unicast address is configured at each interface of a node,\r\nan IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node can generate its\r\nunique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  The\r\nalternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses proposed\r\nin this document is better than known methods like unicast-prefix-based\r\nIPv6 multicast addresses.
