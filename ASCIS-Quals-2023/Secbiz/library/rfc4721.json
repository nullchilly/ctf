This new extension is provided so that a mobile node can\r\nsupply credentials for authorization, using commonly available AAA\r\ninfrastructure elements.  This authorization-enabling extension MAY\r\nco-exist in the same Registration Request with authentication\r\nextensions defined for Mobile IP Registration by RFC 3344.  This\r\ndocument obsoletes RFC 3012.
