The network is responsible for managing IP mobility on\r\nbehalf of the host.  The mobility entities in the network are\r\nresponsible for tracking the movements of the host and initiating the\r\nrequired mobility signaling on its behalf.  This specification\r\ndescribes a network-based mobility management protocol and is\r\nreferred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6.
