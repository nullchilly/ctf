This highly restricts what the customer can do\r\nuntil the customer has authenticated.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement (RA)\r\nextension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal\r\ndevice and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access.  It is\r\nnot a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may\r\nhave with captive portals; it is designed to be used in larger\r\nsolutions.  The method of authenticating to and interacting with the\r\ncaptive portal is out of scope for this document.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8910"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7710","errata_url":null}
