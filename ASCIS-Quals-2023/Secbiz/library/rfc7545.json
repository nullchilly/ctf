This available spectrum is called\r\n\"white space\".  Allowing secondary users access to available spectrum\r\n\"unlocks\" existing spectrum to maximize its utilization and to\r\nprovide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater overall\r\nspectrum utilization.\r\n\r\nOne approach to managing spectrum sharing uses databases to report\r\nspectrum availability to devices.  To achieve interoperability among\r\nmultiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be\r\ndefined and implemented.  This document defines such a protocol, the\r\n\"Protocol to Access White-Space (PAWS) Databases\".","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["dynamic spectrum","radio spectrum","wireless spectrum","spectrum","spectrum database","TV white space","TVWS","TVBD","white space device","WSD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7545","errata_url":null}
