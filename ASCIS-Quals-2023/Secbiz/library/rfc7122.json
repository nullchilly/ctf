It covers convergence layers for the\r\nBundle Protocol (RFC 5050), as well as the transportation of segments\r\nusing the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326).  UDP and\r\nthe Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate\r\ndatagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local\r\nnetwork or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion\r\ncontrol.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use\r\nis recommended whenever possible.  This document is a product of the\r\nDelay-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG) and represents the\r\nconsensus of the DTNRG.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7122","errata_url":null}
