The protocol uses UDP\r\nencapsulation and unicast replication to provide this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe AMT protocol is specifically designed to support rapid deployment\r\nby requiring minimal changes to existing network infrastructure.","pub_date":"February 2015","keywords":["AMT","IGMPv2","IGMPv3","MLDv1","MLDv2","ASM","SSM","amt gateway","amt relay","multicast replication","multicast encapsulation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8777"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7450","errata_url":null}
