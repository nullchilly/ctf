If a LoST client wants\r\nto discover available services for a particular location, it will\r\nperform a <listServicesByLocation> query to the LoST server.\r\nHowever, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context\r\ninformation; that is, it does not provide any additional information\r\nabout the geographical region within which the returned list of\r\nservices is considered valid.  Therefore, this document defines a\r\nService List Boundary that returns a local context along with the\r\nlist of services returned, in order to assist the client in not\r\nmissing a change in available services when moving.  This document \r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":["listservicesbylocation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6197","errata_url":null}
