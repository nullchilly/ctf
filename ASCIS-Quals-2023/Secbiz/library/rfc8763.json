This document provides a number of deployment\r\nconsiderations in the interest of helping the ICN community move\r\nforward to the next step of live deployments. First, the major\r\ndeployment configurations for ICN are described, including the key\r\noverlay and underlay approaches. Then, proposed deployment migration\r\npaths are outlined to address major practical issues, such as network\r\nand application migration. Next, selected ICN trial experiences are\r\nsummarized. Finally, protocol areas that require further\r\nstandardization are identified to facilitate future interoperable ICN\r\ndeployments.
