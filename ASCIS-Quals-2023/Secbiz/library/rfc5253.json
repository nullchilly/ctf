The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic\r\nMode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Basic Mode of operation does not\r\nfeature any exchange of routing information between the Layer 1\r\nnetwork and the customer domain.  This document examines how GMPLS\r\nprotocols can be used to satisfy the requirements of a Basic Mode\r\nL1VPN.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2008","keywords":["gmpls","generalized multiprotocol label switching","l1vpn bm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5253","errata_url":null}
