This document presents extensions to the Mobile IP protocol and a tunnelling method which permits mobile nodes using Mobile IP to operate in private address networks which are separated from the public internet by NAT devices.  The NAT traversal is based on using the Mobile IP Home Agent UDP port for encapsulated data traffic.
