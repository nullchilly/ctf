In order to send changes to an XML document, an entire copy\r\nof the new version must be sent, unless there is a means of\r\nindicating only the portions that have changed.  This document\r\ndescribes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath)\r\nselectors.  These selector values and updated new data content\r\nconstitute the basis of patch operations described in this document.\r\nIn addition to them, with basic &lt;add&gt;, &lt;replace&gt;, and &lt;remove&gt;\r\ndirectives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing\r\nXML document.
