It is a\r\nlocal, per-connection parameter.  This document specifies a new TCP\r\noption -- the TCP User Timeout Option -- that allows one end of a TCP\r\nconnection to advertise its current user timeout value.  This\r\ninformation provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection to\r\nadapt its user timeout accordingly.  Increasing the user timeouts on\r\nboth ends of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods\r\nwithout end-to-end connectivity.  Decreasing the user timeouts allows\r\nbusy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will\r\nmaintain the connection state only for a short time without\r\nconnectivity.
