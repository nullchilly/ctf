This\r\ndocument describes modifications to the deployment and use of AS112\r\ninfrastructure that will allow zones to be added and dropped much\r\nmore easily, using DNAME resource records.\r\n\r\nThis approach makes it possible for any DNS zone administrator to\r\nsink traffic relating to parts of the global DNS namespace under\r\ntheir control to the AS112 infrastructure without coordination with\r\nthe operators of AS112 infrastructure.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["DNS","root server"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7535","errata_url":null}
