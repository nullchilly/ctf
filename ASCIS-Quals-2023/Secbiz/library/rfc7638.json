It defines which fields in a JWK are used in the\r\nhash computation, the method of creating a canonical form for those\r\nfields, and how to convert the resulting Unicode string into a byte\r\nsequence to be hashed.  The resulting hash value can be used for\r\nidentifying or selecting the key represented by the JWK that is the\r\nsubject of the thumbprint.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["JavaScript Object Notation","JSON","JSON Web Key","JWK","ThumbprintOB","Fingerprint","Digest"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7638","errata_url":null}
