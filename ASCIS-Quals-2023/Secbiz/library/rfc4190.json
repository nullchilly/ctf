From these objectives, we\r\npresent a corresponding set of protocols and capabilities, which\r\nprovide a more specific set of recommendations regarding existing\r\nIETF protocols.  Finally, we present two scenarios that act as\r\nguiding models for the objectives and functions listed in this\r\ndocument.  These models, coupled with an example of an existing\r\nservice in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), contribute to\r\na constrained solution space.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2005","keywords":["disaster communications","prioritized voip"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4190","errata_url":null}
