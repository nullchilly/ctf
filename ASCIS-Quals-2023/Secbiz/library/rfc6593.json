A typical domain\r\nmay contain web servers, remote desktop servers, printers, file servers, video\r\ncontent servers, automatons, Points of Presence using artificial intelligence,\r\netc., all advertising their presence.  Unsurprisingly, it\r\nis expected that some protocols and services will choose the comfort\r\nof anonymity and avoid discovery.\r\n\r\nThis memo describes a new experimental protocol for this purpose\r\nutilizing the Domain Pseudonym System (DPS), and discusses strategies\r\nfor its successful implementation and deployment.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"1 April 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6593","errata_url":null}
