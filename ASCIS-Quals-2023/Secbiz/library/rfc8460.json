These protocols can fail due to\r\nmisconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered messages or\r\ndelivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.  This document\r\ndescribes a reporting mechanism and format by which sending systems\r\ncan share statistics and specific information about potential\r\nfailures with recipient domains.  Recipient domains can then use this\r\ninformation to both detect potential attacks and diagnose\r\nunintentional misconfigurations.","pub_date":"September 2018","keywords":["DANE","MTA-STS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8460","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8460"}
