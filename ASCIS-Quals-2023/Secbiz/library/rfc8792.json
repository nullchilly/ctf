One strategy, called the \"single\r\nbackslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single\r\nbackslash ('\\') character to indicate where line-folding has\r\noccurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character\r\nthat is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second\r\nstrategy, called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first\r\nstrategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the\r\ncontinuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported\r\nby the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header\r\nenabling automated reconstitution of the original content.","pub_date":"June 2020","keywords":["sourcecode","artwork"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8792","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8792"}
