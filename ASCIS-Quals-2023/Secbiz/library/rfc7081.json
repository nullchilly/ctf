Such strategies, which mainly consist of\r\nconfiguration changes and minimal software modifications to existing\r\nclients and servers, aim to provide a single, full-featured,\r\nreal-time communication service by using complementary subsets of\r\nfeatures from SIP and from XMPP.  Typically, such subsets consist of\r\ntelephony capabilities from SIP and instant messaging and presence\r\ncapabilities from XMPP.  This document does not define any new\r\nprotocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP and, by intent, does not\r\nattempt to standardize \"best current practices\".  Instead, it merely\r\naims to provide practical guidance to those who are interested in the\r\ncombined use of SIP and XMPP for real-time communication.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["real-time communication","unified communication","voice","video","instant messaging","chat","presence","telephony"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7081","errata_url":null}
