This document extends the current location configuration\r\nprotocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are\r\napplied to a URI so that the host can view or set these rules.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["geopriv","geolocation","privacy","policy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7199","errata_url":null}
