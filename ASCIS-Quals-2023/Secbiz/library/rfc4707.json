Data for the administration of newsgroups and\r\nhierarchies are kept in a distributed hierarchical database and are\r\navailable through a client-server protocol.\r\n\r\nThe database is accessible by news servers, news administrators, and\r\nnews readers.  News servers can update their configuration\r\nautomatically; administrators are able to get the data manually.  News\r\nreader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS\r\nserver, automatically or at a user's discretion, which provides detailed\r\ninformation about groups and hierarchies to the user.\r\n\r\nNAS is usable in coexistence with the current, established process of\r\ncontrol messages; an unwanted interference is impossible.\r\nFurthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of\r\nUsenet in a hierarchical database.  NAS can be used without\r\nmodification of existing news relay, news server, or news reader\r\nsoftware; however, some tasks will be better accomplished with\r\nNAS-compliant software.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2006","keywords":["[--------|e]","news servers","news administrator","news reader"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4707","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4707"}
