The complexity raised by the control of such data planes\r\nis similar to that seen in classical IP\/MPLS networks.  By extending\r\nMPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a\r\ncomprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered network of\r\neither a single switching technology or multiple switching\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\nIn GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a\r\nnetwork of multiple switching types is referred to in this document as\r\na multi-region network (MRN).  When referring in general to a layered\r\nnetwork, which may consist of either single or multiple regions, this\r\ndocument uses the term multi-layer network (MLN).  This document\r\ndefines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region \/ multi-layer\r\nnetworks and lists a set of functional requirements.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2008","keywords":["generalized mpls","switching technology"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5212","errata_url":null}
