This semantic is available in all popular\r\noperating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.\r\nLogical-interface support is required on the mobile node attached to\r\na Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for leveraging various network-based\r\nmobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs,\r\nmultihoming, and flow mobility support.  This document explains the\r\noperational details of the logical-interface construct and the\r\nspecifics on how link-layer implementations hide the physical\r\ninterfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the\r\nattached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the\r\napplicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and\r\nanalyzes the issues around it when used in conjunction with various\r\nmobility management features.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["Logical-interface","virtual-interface","Logical interface"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7847","errata_url":null}
