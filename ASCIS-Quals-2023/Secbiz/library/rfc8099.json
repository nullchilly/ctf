A TTZ comprises a group of routers and a number of links\r\nconnecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is not\r\naware of the zone.  A TTZ hides the internal topology of the TTZ from\r\nthe outside.  It does not directly advertise any internal information\r\nabout the TTZ to a router outside of the TTZ.  The information about\r\nthe links and routers such as a link down inside the TTZ is not\r\nadvertised to any router outside of the TTZ.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":["IGP","OSPF","TTZ"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8099","errata_url":null}
