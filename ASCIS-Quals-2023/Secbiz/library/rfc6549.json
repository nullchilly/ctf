OSPFv2 can utilize such a\r\nmechanism in order to support multiple routing domains on the same\r\nsubnet.\r\n\r\nThis document defines the OSPFv2 Instance ID to enable separate\r\nOSPFv2 protocol instances on the same interface.  Unlike OSPFv3 where\r\nthe Instance ID can be used for multiple purposes, such as putting\r\nthe same interface in multiple areas, the OSPFv2 Instance ID is\r\nreserved for identifying protocol instances.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 2328.
