Even though it is designed to be totally\r\nbackward compatible to applications, the data transport differs\r\ncompared to regular TCP, and there are several additional degrees of\r\nfreedom that applications may wish to exploit.  This document\r\nsummarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such as\r\nchanges in performance.  Furthermore, it discusses compatibility\r\nissues of MPTCP in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.\r\nFinally, the document describes a basic application interface that is\r\na simple extension of TCP's interface for MPTCP-aware applications.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6897","errata_url":null}
