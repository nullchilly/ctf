   This document is about Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence
   (CLUE) signaling.  It specifies how the CLUE protocol and the CLUE
   data channel are used in conjunction with each other and with existing
   signaling mechanisms, such as SIP and the Session Description Protocol
   (SDP), to produce a telepresence call.

To enable devices to participate in a telepresence call, where they select the sources
they wish to view, receive those media sources, and display them in an
optimal fashion, Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) employs
two principal and interrelated protocol negotiations.
SDP <xref target="RFC4566" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4566"/>, conveyed via 
SIP <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/>, is used to negotiate the specific media
capabilities that can be delivered to specific addresses on a device.
Meanwhile, CLUE protocol messages <xref target="RFC8847" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8847"/>, transported via a 
CLUE data channel <xref target="RFC8850" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8850"/>, are used to
negotiate the Capture Sources available, their attributes, and any constraints
in their use. They also allow the far-end device to specify which Captures
they wish to receive. It is recommended that those documents be read prior to
this one as this document assumes familiarity with those protocols and hence
uses terminology from each with limited introduction.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">
Beyond negotiating the CLUE channel, SDP is also used to negotiate the details
of supported media streams and the maximum capability of each of those
streams. As the CLUE Framework <xref target="RFC8845" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8845"/>
defines a manner in which the Media Provider expresses their maximum Encoding
Group capabilities, SDP is also used to express the encoding limits for each
potential Encoding. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
Backwards compatibility is an important consideration of the protocol: it is
vital that a CLUE-capable device contacting a device that does not support
CLUE is able to fall back to a fully functional non-CLUE call. The document
also defines how a non-CLUE call may be upgraded to CLUE mid-call and,
similarly, how CLUE functionality can be removed mid-call to return to a
standard non-CLUE call.

SDP, which defines media addresses and limits, and the CLUE channel,
which defines properties of Capture Devices available, scene information, and
additional constraints. As a result, certain operations, such as advertising

To avoid the need to implement interlocking state machines with the potential
to reach invalid states if messages were to be lost, or be rewritten en route
by middleboxes, the state machines in SDP and CLUE operate independently. The
state of the CLUE channel does not restrict when an implementation may send a
new SDP Offer or Answer; likewise, the implementation's ability to send a
new CLUE 'advertisement' or 'configure' message is not restricted by the
results of or the state of the most recent SDP negotiation (unless the SDP
negotiation has removed the CLUE channel).

CLUE 'advertisement' message providing the corresponding capture information
would typically include corresponding "a=inactive" lines in its answer, and

A CLUE call may involve sending and/or receiving significant numbers of media
streams. Conventionally, media streams are sent and received on unique ports.
However, each separate port used for this purpose may impose costs that a
device wishes to avoid, such as the need to open that port on firewalls and
NATs, the need to collect Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidates <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/>, etc.

This specification imposes no additional requirements or restrictions on the
usage of BUNDLE when used with CLUE. There is no restriction on combining
CLUE-controlled media lines and non-CLUE-controlled media lines in the same
BUNDLE group or in multiple such groups. However, there are several steps an

BUNDLE mandates that the initial SDP Offer <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use a unique address for each
"m=" line with a non-zero port. Because CLUE implementations generally will
not include CLUE-controlled media lines, with the exception of the data
channel in the initial SDP Offer, CLUE devices that support large numbers of

successfully negotiate BUNDLE.

An implementation that does include CLUE-controlled media lines in its initial
SDP Offer while also using BUNDLE must take care to avoid rendering its
CLUE-controlled media lines unusable in the event the far end does not
negotiate BUNDLE if it wishes to avoid the risk of additional SDP exchanges to
resolve this issue. This is best achieved by not sending any CLUE-controlled
media lines in an initial offer with the 'bundle-only' attribute unless it has
been established via some other channel that the recipient supports and is
able to use BUNDLE.

corresponding non-CLUE-controlled audio and video lines. Bob also includes the
"sip.clue" media feature tag in the 200 OK. Alice and Bob are each now able to
send a single audio and video stream. This is illustrated as MEDIA 1.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-7">
With the successful initial SDP Offer/Answer exchange complete, Alice and Bob
are also free to negotiate the CLUE data channel. This is illustrated as CLUE
DATA CHANNEL ESTABLISHED.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-8">
Once the data channel is established, CLUE protocol negotiation begins. In this
case, Bob was the DTLS client (sending "a=active" in his SDP Answer) and hence is
the CLUE Channel Initiator. He sends a CLUE OPTIONS message describing his
version support. On receiving that message, Alice sends her corresponding CLUE
OPTIONS RESPONSE.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-9">
With the OPTIONS phase complete, Alice now sends her CLUE 'advertisement'
message (CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1). She advertises three static Captures
representing her three cameras. She also includes switched Captures suitable
for systems with one or two screens. All of these Captures are in a single Capture
Scene, with suitable Capture Scene Views that tell Bob he should
subscribe to the three static Captures, the two switched Captures, or the one
switched Capture. Alice has no simultaneity constraints, so all six
Captures are included in one simultaneous set. Finally, Alice includes an Encoding Group
with three Encoding IDs: "enc1", "enc2", and "enc3". These Encoding IDs aren't
currently valid but will match the next SDP Offer she sends.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-10">
Bob received CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1 but does not yet send a 'configure' message, 
because he has not yet received Alice's Encoding information; thus, he
does not know if she will have sufficient resources in order to send him the two
streams he ideally wants at a quality he is happy with. Because Bob is not
sending an immediate 'configure' message with the "ack" element set, he must
send an explicit 'ack' message (CLUE ACK 1) to signal receipt of CLUE
ADVERTISEMENT 1. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-11">
Bob also sends his CLUE 'advertisement' message (CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 2) --
though the diagram shows that this occurs after Alice sends CLUE ADVERTISEMENT
1, Bob sends his 'advertisement' message independently and does not wait for
CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1 to arrive. He advertises two static Captures representing
his cameras. He also includes a single composed Capture for single-screen
systems, in which he will composite the two camera views into a single video
stream. All three Captures are in a single Capture Scene, with suitable
Capture Scene Views that tell Alice she should subscribe to either the two
static Captures or the single composed Capture. Bob also has no simultaneity
constraints, so he includes all three Captures in one simultaneous set. Bob also
includes a single Encoding Group with two Encoding IDs: "foo" and "bar".
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-12">
Similarly, Alice receives CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 2 but does not yet send a
'configure' message, because she has not yet received Bob's Encoding
information; instead, she sends an 'ack' message (CLUE ACK 2).
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-13">
Both sides have now sent their CLUE 'advertisement' messages, and an SDP
exchange is required to negotiate Encodings. For simplicity, in this case,
Alice is shown sending an INVITE with a new offer; in many implementations,
both sides might send an INVITE, which would be resolved by use of the 491
Request Pending resolution mechanism from <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/>.

Alice now sends SIP INVITE 2. She maintains the sendrecv audio, video, and CLUE

      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-1">
CLUE makes use of a number of protocols and mechanisms, either defined by CLUE
or long-standing. The Security Considerations section of the 
CLUE Framework document <xref target="RFC8845" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8845"/> addresses the
need to secure these mechanisms by following the recommendations of the
individual protocols.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-2">
Beyond the need to secure the constituent protocols, the use of CLUE does
impose additional security concerns. One area of increased risk involves the
potential for a malicious party to subvert a CLUE-capable device to attack a
third party by driving large volumes of media (particularly video) traffic at
them by establishing a connection to the CLUE-capable device and directing the
media to the victim. While this is a risk for all media devices, a
CLUE-capable device may allow the attacker to configure multiple media streams
to be sent, significantly increasing the volume of traffic directed at the
victim.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-3">
This attack can be prevented by ensuring that the media recipient intends to
receive the media packets. As such, all CLUE-capable devices <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support key 
negotiation and receiver intent assurance via DTLS / Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) <xref target="RFC5763" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5763"/> on CLUE-controlled RTP "m=" lines, and they
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use it or some other mechanism that provides receiver intent assurance.
All CLUE-controlled RTP "m" lines must be secured and implemented using
mechanisms such as SRTP <xref target="RFC3711" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3711"/>. CLUE implementations
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose not to require the use of SRTP to secure legacy
(non-CLUE-controlled) media for backwards compatibility with older SIP clients
that are incapable of supporting it.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-4">
CLUE also defines a new media feature tag that indicates CLUE support. This
tag may be present even in non-CLUE calls, which increases the metadata
available about the sending device; this can help an attacker differentiate
between multiple devices and identify otherwise anonymized users
via the fingerprint of features their device supports. To prevent this, SIP
signaling used to set up CLUE sessions <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> always be encrypted using
TLS <xref target="RFC5630" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5630"/>.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-11-5">
The CLUE protocol also carries additional information that could be used to
help fingerprint a particular user or to identify the specific version of
software being used. 
The CLUE Framework <xref target="RFC8847" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8847"/> provides details
about these issues and how to mitigate them.

In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.  The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer Units (NALUs), produced by an H.264 video encoder, in each RTP payload.  The payload format has wide applicability, as it supports applications from simple low bitrate conversational usage, to Internet video streaming with interleaved transmission, to high bitrate video-on-demand.</t>
