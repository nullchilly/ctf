A threshold is used to clearly define when a packet is\r\nconsidered lost, to bound computational complexity at O(N), and to\r\nkeep the memory requirement for evaluation independent of N, where N\r\nis the length of the packet sequence.  RD is a comprehensive metric\r\nthat captures the characteristics of reordering, while RBD evaluates\r\nthe sequences from the point of view of recovery from reordering.\r\n\r\nThese metrics are simple to compute yet comprehensive in their\r\ncharacterization of packet reordering.  The measures are robust and\r\northogonal to packet loss and duplication.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2008","keywords":["reorder density","rd","reorder buffer-occupancy density","rbd"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5236","errata_url":null}
