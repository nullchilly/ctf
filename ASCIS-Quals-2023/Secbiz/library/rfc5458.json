This document\r\nprovides a threat analysis and derives the security requirements\r\nwhen using the Transport Stream, TS, to support an Internet\r\nnetwork-layer using Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation\r\n(ULE) defined in RFC 4326.  The document also provides the\r\nmotivation for link-layer security for a ULE Stream.  A ULE Stream\r\nmay be used to send IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets, and other\r\nProtocol Data Units (PDUs) to an arbitrarily large number of\r\nReceivers supporting unicast and\/or multicast transmission.\r\n\r\nThe analysis also describes applicability to the Generic Stream\r\nEncapsulation (GSE) defined by the Digital Video Broadcasting\r\n(DVB) Project.  This memo provides information for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["iso 13818-1","transport stream","ts","ule stream","gse","generic stream encapsulation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5458","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5458"}
