A prime use of MRTs is for unicast\r\nand multicast IP\/LDP Fast Reroute, which we will refer to as\r\n\"MRT-FRR\".\r\n\r\nThe sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the ability to advertise\r\nan MRT Capability.  This document describes that extension and the\r\nassociated behavior expected for Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and\r\nLabel Edge Routers (LERs) advertising the MRT Capability.\r\n\r\nMRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions, so three multi-topology\r\nIDs have been allocated from the MPLS MT-ID space.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["fast-reroute","MRT","MRT-FRR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8320","errata_url":null}
