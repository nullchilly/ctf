For each type of egress failure, it defines the\r\nroles of Point of Local Repair (PLR), protector, and backup egress\r\nrouter and the procedures of establishing a bypass tunnel from a PLR\r\nto a protector. It describes the behaviors of these routers in\r\nhandling an egress failure, including local repair on the PLR and\r\ncontext-based forwarding on the protector. The framework can be used\r\nto develop egress protection mechanisms to reduce traffic loss before\r\nglobal repair reacts to an egress failure and control-plane protocols\r\nconverge on the topology changes due to the egress failure.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["fast reroute","egress protection","local repair"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8679","errata_url":null}
