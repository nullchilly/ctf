There\r\nare, however, circumstances where hash algorithms are used, such as\r\nindirect signatures, where the hash of one or more contents are\r\nsigned, and identification of an X.509 certificate or other object by\r\nthe use of a fingerprint. This document defines hash algorithms that\r\nare identified by COSE algorithm identifiers.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["SHA-1 Hash Algorithm","SHA-2 Hash Algorithm","SHAKE Algorithm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9054","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9054"}
