No changes are\r\nrequired to either host protocol stacks or to the \"core\" of the\r\nInternet infrastructure.  The Locator\/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)\r\ncan be incrementally deployed, without a \"flag day\", and offers\r\nTraffic Engineering, multihoming, and mobility benefits to early\r\nadopters, even when there are relatively few LISP-capable sites.\r\n\r\nDesign and development of LISP was largely motivated by the problem\r\nstatement produced by the October 2006 IAB Routing and Addressing\r\nWorkshop.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9300","RFC9301"],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8113"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6830","errata_url":null}
