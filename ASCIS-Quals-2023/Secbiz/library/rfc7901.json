Wouters"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"16","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"Domain Name System Operations","abstract":"This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a\r\nsecurity-aware validating resolver configured to use a forwarding\r\nresolver to send a single query, requesting a complete validation\r\npath along with the regular query answer.  The reduction in queries\r\npotentially lowers the latency and reduces the need to send multiple\r\nqueries at once.  This extension mandates the use of source-IP-\r\nverified transport such as TCP or UDP with EDNS-COOKIE, so it cannot\r\nbe abused in amplification attacks.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["DNSSEC","EDNS0","latency"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7901","errata_url":null}
