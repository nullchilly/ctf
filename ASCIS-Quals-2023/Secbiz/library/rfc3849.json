Since site-local and link-local unicast addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these addresses cannot be used in many example situations.  The document describes the use of the IPv6 address prefix 2001:DB8::\/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
