It specifies the motivation, requirements, and use cases,\r\nand defines an information model for recording interactions between\r\nelements implementing the I2RS protocol.  This framework provides a\r\nconsistent tracing interface for components implementing the I2RS\r\narchitecture to record what was done, by which component, and when.\r\nIt aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be\r\nused for troubleshooting, auditing, forensics, and accounting\r\npurposes.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["I2RS","I2RS Traceability","I2RS Traceability"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7922","errata_url":null}
