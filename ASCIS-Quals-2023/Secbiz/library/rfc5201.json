HIP is based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie-\r\nHellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host\r\nIdentity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is\r\ndesigned to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-\r\nmiddle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable\r\nsecurity protocol, such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP),\r\nit provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper-\r\nlayer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.  This memo defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2008","keywords":["[--------]","hip","ip-layer state","integrity protection","optional encryption"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7401"],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6253"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5201","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5201"}
