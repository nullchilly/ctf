      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">Note that the change to the Expert Review guidelines makes the registry and the designated experts slightly more
         vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks through excessive and bogus requests for code points.  It is expected that
         the registry cannot be effectively attacked because the designated experts would, themselves, fall to any such
         attack first.  Designated experts are expected to report to the IDR Working Group chairs and responsible Area
         Director if they believe an attack to be in progress and should immediately halt all requests for allocation.
         This may temporarily block all legitimate requests until mitigations have been put in place.</t>

            <t indent="0">Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
            <t indent="0">To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t>
