They\r\nalso have a range of management and provisioning protocols to\r\nconfigure and activate network resources.  These mechanisms represent\r\nkey technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.  The\r\nterm \"Traffic Engineered network\" refers to a network that uses any\r\nconnection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or\r\ncentralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to-\r\nend connectivity.\r\n\r\nAbstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied\r\nto a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a\r\nsingle virtualized network that is under the control of a network\r\noperator or the customer of the operator that actually owns the\r\nnetwork resources.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of TE\r\nNetworks (ACTN) to support virtual network services and connectivity\r\nservices.","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["SDN","Orchestration"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8453","errata_url":null}
