In order to protect a node N, the\r\nPoint of Local Repair (PLR) Label Switching Router (LSR) of N must\r\nlearn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that traffic can be\r\nredirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting the traffic\r\naround the failed node N depends on existing Point-to-Point (P2P)\r\nLabel Switched Paths (LSPs).  The pre-established LSPs originate from\r\nthe PLR LSR and terminate on the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR N.","pub_date":"January 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7715","errata_url":null}
