<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The ICMP specification [<a href="./rfc0792" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol&quot;">RFC0792</a>] defined the ICMP Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant as a mechanism for
   congestion control.  ICMP Source Quench has been known to be an
   ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and generation of
   ICMP Source Quench messages by routers has been formally deprecated
   by [<a href="./rfc1812" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>] since 1995.  However, reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages in transport protocols has never been formally deprecated.

   This document formally deprecates reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages by transport protocols such as TCP [<a href="./rfc0793" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">RFC0793</a>], formally
   updating [<a href="./rfc0792" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol&quot;">RFC0792</a>], [<a href="./rfc1122" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers&quot;">RFC1122</a>], and [<a href="./rfc1812" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>].  Additionally, it
   provides a recommendation against the implementation of [<a href="./rfc1016" title="&quot;Something a host could do with source quench: The Source Quench Introduced Delay (SQuID)&quot;">RFC1016</a>].
   The rationale for these specification updates is as follows:

   o  Processing of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers has been
      deprecated for nearly 17 years [<a href="./rfc1812" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>].

   o  Virtually all popular host implementations have removed support
      for ICMP Source Quench messages since (at least) 2005 [<a href="./rfc5927" title="&quot;ICMP Attacks against TCP&quot;">RFC5927</a>].

   o  Widespread deployment of ICMP filtering makes it impossible to
      rely on ICMP Source Quench messages for congestion control.

   o  The IETF has moved away from ICMP Source Quench messages for
      congestion control (e.g., note the development of Explicit
      Congestion Notification (ECN) [<a href="./rfc3168" title="&quot;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC3168</a>] and the fact that ICMPv6
      [<a href="./rfc4443" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC4443</a>] does not even specify a Source Quench message).

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6633">RFC 6633</a>            Deprecation of ICMP Source Quench           May 2012</span>


         ICMP Source Quench messages are not normally seen in the
         deployed Internet and were considered rare at least as far back
         as 1994 [<a href="#ref-Floyd1994" title="&quot;TCP and Explicit Congestion Notification&quot;">Floyd1994</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="./rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  ICMP Source Quench Messages</span>

   The ICMP specification [<a href="./rfc0792" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol&quot;">RFC0792</a>] defined the ICMP Source Quench
   message (type 4, code 0), which was meant to provide a mechanism for
   congestion control.  The Host Requirements RFC [<a href="./rfc1122" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers&quot;">RFC1122</a>] stated in
   <a href="#section-4.2.3.9">Section 4.2.3.9</a> that hosts MUST react to ICMP Source Quench messages
   by slowing transmission on the connection, and further added that the
   RECOMMENDED procedure was to put the corresponding connection in the
   slow-start phase of TCP's congestion control algorithm [<a href="./rfc5681" title="&quot;TCP Congestion Control&quot;">RFC5681</a>].

   [<a id="ref-RFC1812">RFC1812</a>] noted that research suggested that ICMP Source Quench was
   an ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion, and formally
   deprecated the generation of ICMP Source Quench messages by routers,
   stating that routers SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages in
   response to congestion.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5927">RFC5927</a>] discussed the use of ICMP Source Quench messages for
   performing "blind throughput-reduction" attacks, and noted that most
   TCP implementations silently ignore ICMP Source Quench messages.

   We note that TCP implements its own congestion control mechanisms
   [<a href="./rfc5681" title="&quot;TCP Congestion Control&quot;">RFC5681</a>] [<a href="./rfc3168" title="&quot;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP&quot;">RFC3168</a>], which do not depend on ICMP Source Quench
   messages.

      It is interesting to note that ICMPv6 [<a href="./rfc4443" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification&quot;">RFC4443</a>] does not specify a
      Source Quench message.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Updating <a href="./rfc1122">RFC 1122</a></span>

   This document hereby updates <a href="./rfc1122#section-3.2.2.3">Section&nbsp;3.2.2.3 of [RFC1122]</a> as follows:

      A host MUST NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages.

      If a Source Quench message is received, the IP layer MAY silently
      discard it.

   <a href="./rfc1122#section-4.2.3.9">Section&nbsp;4.2.3.9 of [RFC1122]</a> is updated as follows:

      TCP MUST silently discard any received ICMP Source Quench
      messages.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6633">RFC 6633</a>            Deprecation of ICMP Source Quench           May 2012</span>


   The consensus of the TSV WG was that there are no valid reasons for a
   host to generate or react to an ICMP Source Quench message in the
   current Internet.  The recommendation that a sender "MUST NOT" send
   an ICMP Source Quench message is because there is no known valid
   reason for a host to generate this message.  The only known impact of
   a sender ignoring this requirement is that it may necessarily consume
   network and endpoint resources.  Discarding ICMP Source Quench
   messages at the Internet layer (rather than at the transport layer)
   is a performance optimization that is permitted by this update.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Updating <a href="./rfc1812">RFC 1812</a></span>

   This document hereby updates <a href="./rfc1812#section-4.3.3.3">Section&nbsp;4.3.3.3 of [RFC1812]</a> as follows:

      A router MUST ignore any ICMP Source Quench messages it receives.

   The consensus of the TSV WG was that there are no valid reasons for a
   router to react to ICMP Source Quench messages in the current
   Internet.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Clarification for UDP, SCTP, and DCCP</span>

   UDP [<a href="./rfc0768" title="&quot;User Datagram Protocol&quot;">RFC0768</a>] did not explicitly specify support for ICMP Source
   Quench messages.  Hereby, we clarify that UDP endpoints MUST silently
   discard received ICMP Source Quench messages.

   It is understood that SCTP [<a href="./rfc4960" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>] and DCCP [<a href="./rfc4340" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>] did not
   specify support for processing received ICMP Source Quench messages.
   Hereby, we clarify that DCCP and SCTP endpoints MUST silently discard
   received ICMP Source Quench messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  General Advice to Transport Protocols</span>

   If a Source Quench message is received by any other transport-
   protocol instance, it MUST be silently ignored.

   The TSV WG is not aware of any mechanism that requires processing of
   these messages and therefore expects other transports to follow the
   recommendations in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  Note that since generation of ICMP
   Source Quench messages has been deprecated for many years, and since
   this document additionally deprecates reaction to ICMP Source Quench
   messages by IETF-specified transports, future applications cannot
   expect to receive these messages.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Recommendation Regarding <a href="./rfc1016">RFC 1016</a></span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC1016">RFC1016</a>] describes an experimental approach to the handling of ICMP
   Source Quench messages in hosts that was considered in 1987.  Even
   though <a href="./rfc1016">RFC 1016</a> has never been on the IETF Standards Track, for
   clarity and avoidance of doubt we note that the approach described in
   [<a href="./rfc1016" title="&quot;Something a host could do with source quench: The Source Quench Introduced Delay (SQuID)&quot;">RFC1016</a>] MUST NOT be implemented.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   ICMP Source Quench messages could be leveraged for performing blind
   throughput-reduction attacks against TCP and similar protocols.  This
   attack vector, along with possible countermeasures, has been
   discussed in great detail in [<a href="./rfc5927" title="&quot;ICMP Attacks against TCP&quot;">RFC5927</a>] and [<a href="#ref-CPNI-TCP" title="&quot;Security Assessment of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&quot;">CPNI-TCP</a>].  Silently
   ignoring ICMP Source Quench messages, as specified in this document,
   eliminates the aforementioned attack vector.

   For current TCP implementations, receipt of an ICMP Source Quench
   message should not result in security issues because, as noted in
   [<a href="./rfc5927" title="&quot;ICMP Attacks against TCP&quot;">RFC5927</a>] and [<a href="#ref-CPNI-TCP" title="&quot;Security Assessment of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&quot;">CPNI-TCP</a>], virtually all current versions of popular
   TCP implementations already silently ignore ICMP Source Quench
   messages.  This is also the case for SCTP and DCCP implementations.

   Hosts, security gateways, and firewalls MUST silently discard
   received ICMP Source Quench packets and SHOULD log such drops as a
   security fault with at least minimal details (IP Source Address, IP
   Destination Address, ICMP message type, and date/time the packet was
   seen).

      We note that security devices such as the Snort Network Intrusion
      Detection System (NIDS) have logged ICMP Source Quench messages as
      such for more than ten years [<a href="#ref-Anderson2002" title="&quot;Heterogeneous Sensor Correlation: A Case Study of Live Traffic Analysis&quot;">Anderson2002</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   IANA has marked ICMP type 4 (Source Quench) as "Deprecated" in the
   ICMP Parameters registry [<a href="#ref-ICMPPARREG" title="&quot;Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Parameters&quot;">ICMPPARREG</a>] with a reference to this
   document.

   A large number of implementations completely ignore ICMP Source
   Quench messages meant for TCP connections.  This behavior has been
   implemented in, at least, Linux [<a href="#ref-Linux">Linux</a>] since 2004, and in FreeBSD
   [<a href="#ref-FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>], NetBSD [<a href="#ref-NetBSD">NetBSD</a>], OpenBSD [<a href="#ref-OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a>], and Solaris 10 since
   2005.  Additionally, OpenSolaris [<a href="#ref-OpenSolaris">OpenSolaris</a>] has always shipped
   with support for ICMP Source Quench messages disabled.
