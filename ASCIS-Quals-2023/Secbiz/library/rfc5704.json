Some of\r\nthese problems may cause significant harm to the Internet.  The\r\ndocument suggests that a robust procedure is required prevent this\r\nfrom occurring in the future.  The IAB has selected a number of case\r\nstudies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS), as recent examples to\r\ndescribe the hazard to the Internet architecture that results from\r\nuncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.\r\n\r\nThis experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the\r\nrelationship between the IETF and the ITU-T.  In particular, this was\r\nachieved via the establishment of the \"Joint working team on\r\nMPLS-TP\".  In addition, the leadership of the two organizations\r\nagreed to improve inter-organizational working practices so as to\r\navoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF\r\nRFCs.\r\n\r\nWhilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the\r\nscope of the document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping\r\nprotocol interest with the IETF.  This memo provides information for\r\nthe Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2009","keywords":["ITU-T","MPLS-TP","T-MPLS","Joint working team","JWT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5704","errata_url":null}
