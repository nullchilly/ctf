HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying\r\nand latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC\r\ndevices behind NATs to communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nThis document is non-normative and is only written to explain HNT in\r\norder to provide a reference to the Internet community and an\r\ninformative description to manufacturers and users.\r\n\r\nLatching, which is one of the HNT components, has a number of\r\nsecurity issues covered here.  Because of those, and unless all\r\nsecurity considerations explained here are taken into account and\r\nsolved, the IETF advises against use of the latching mechanism over\r\nthe Internet and recommends other solutions, such as the Interactive\r\nConnectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["VoIP","firewall traversal"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7362","errata_url":null}
