This version of the TCPCL protocol\r\nresolves implementation issues in the earlier TCPCL version 3 as\r\ndefined in RFC 7242 and provides updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP)\r\ncontents, encodings, and convergence-layer requirements in BP version\r\n7 (BPv7). Specifically, TCPCLv4 uses BPv7 bundles encoded by the\r\nConcise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) as its service data unit\r\nbeing transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.\r\nThis TCPCL version also includes security and extensibility\r\nmechanisms.","pub_date":"January 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9174","errata_url":null}
