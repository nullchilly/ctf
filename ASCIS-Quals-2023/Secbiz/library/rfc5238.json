DTLS provides communications privacy for\r\napplications that use datagram transport protocols and\r\nallows client\/server applications to communicate in a way\r\nthat is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect\r\ntampering or message forgery.  DCCP is a transport protocol\r\nthat provides a congestion-controlled unreliable datagram\r\nservice.
