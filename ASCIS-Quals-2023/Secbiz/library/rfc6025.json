Some specifications\r\nwere written using a now deprecated version of ASN.1 and some were\r\nwritten using the current version of ASN.1.  Not all ASN.1 compilers\r\nsupport both older and current syntax.  This document is intended to\r\nprovide guidance to specification authors and to implementers\r\nconverting ASN.1 modules from one version of ASN.1 to another version\r\nwithout causing changes to the \"bits on the wire\".  This document\r\ndoes not provide a comprehensive tutorial of any version of ASN.1.\r\nInstead, it addresses ASN.1 features that are used in IETF Security\r\nArea specifications with a focus on items that vary with the ASN.1\r\nversion.
