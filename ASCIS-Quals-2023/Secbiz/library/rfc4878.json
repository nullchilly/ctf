The Ethernet OAM functionality is complementary to the\r\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in that it is focused on a\r\nsmall set of link-specific functions for directly connected Ethernet\r\ninterfaces.  This document defines objects for controlling those link\r\nOAM functions and for providing results and status of the OAM\r\nfunctions to management entities.
