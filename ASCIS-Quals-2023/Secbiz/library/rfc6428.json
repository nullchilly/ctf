Connectivity Verification augments Continuity Check\r\nin order to provide confirmation that the desired source is connected\r\nto the desired sink.  Remote Defect Indication enables an end point to\r\nreport, to its associated end point, a fault or defect condition that\r\nit detects on a pseudowire, Label Switched Path, or Section.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies specific extensions to Bidirectional\r\nForwarding Detection (BFD) and methods for\r\nproactive Continuity Check, Continuity Verification, and Remote Defect\r\nIndication for MPLS-TP pseudowires, Label Switched Paths, and Sections\r\nusing BFD as extended by this memo.
