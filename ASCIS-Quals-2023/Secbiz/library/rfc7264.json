RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive routing for routing\r\nmessages.  The new optional extension provides a shorter route for\r\nresponses, thereby reducing overhead on intermediate peers.  This\r\ndocument also describes potential cases where this extension can be\r\nused.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["P2P"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7264","errata_url":null}
