This essentially\r\nallows the mobile node to utilize all the available network\r\ninterfaces and build a higher aggregated logical pipe with its home\r\nagent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions\r\nalso allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate IP traffic\r\nflow policies for binding individual flows with the registered care-of\r\naddresses.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["Multipath","Flow Binding","Hybrid Access","Flow Mobility","MIPv4-NEMO"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7629","errata_url":null}
