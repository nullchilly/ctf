As SIP networks increasingly transition from IPv4-only\r\nto dual-stack, a quality user experience must be ensured for dual-\r\nstack SIP implementations.  This document updates the DNS procedures\r\ndescribed in RFC 3263 for dual-stack SIP implementations in\r\npreparation for forthcoming specifications for applying \"Happy                  \r\nEyeballs\" principles to SIP.","pub_date":"September 2016","keywords":["A record","address family preference","AAAA record","DNS","getaddrinfo","Happy Eyeballs","IPv6 address selection","SIP","SRV record","dual-stack","IPv4","IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3263"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7984","errata_url":null}
