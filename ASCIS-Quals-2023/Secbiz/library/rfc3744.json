This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal.  A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories.  Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names.
