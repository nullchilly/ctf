Parent"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"32","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the\r\nestablishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or\r\nIPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or\r\nUDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is\r\nused by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A\r\nmobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6\r\nnetworks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6\r\nonly.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel\r\nservers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the\r\nmodel of the tunnel broker model.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["[--------]","IPv6","Tunnel","Transition","TSP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5572","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5572"}
