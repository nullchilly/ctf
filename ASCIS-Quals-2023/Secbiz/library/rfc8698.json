In the proposed scheme, the\r\nsender regulates its sending rate, based on either implicit or\r\nexplicit congestion signaling, in a unified approach. The scheme can\r\nbenefit from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings from\r\nnetwork nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the\r\nabsence of such markings by reacting to queuing delays and packet\r\nlosses instead.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["Multimedia","Congestion Control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8698","errata_url":null}
