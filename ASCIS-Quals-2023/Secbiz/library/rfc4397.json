The ITU-T has specified an architecture for\r\nthe control of Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON).\r\n\r\nThis document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS\r\nterminology within the context of the ASON architecture.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that GMPLS is applicable in a wider set of\r\ncontexts than just ASON.  The definitions presented in this document\r\ndo not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of GMPLS\r\nconcepts.  This document simply allows the GMPLS terms to be applied\r\nwithin the ASON context.
