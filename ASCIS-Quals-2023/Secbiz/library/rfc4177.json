The purpose of\r\nthis analysis is to provide a taxonomy for classification of various\r\nproposed approaches to multi-homing.  It is also an objective of\r\nthis exercise to identify common aspects of this domain of study, and\r\nalso to provide a framework that can allow exploration of some of the\r\nfurther implications of various architectural extensions that are\r\nintended to support multi-homing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2005","keywords":["internet protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4177","errata_url":null}
