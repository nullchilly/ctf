This measurement capability\r\nalso provides operators with greater visibility into the performance\r\ncharacteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,\r\ntroubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.  This document\r\nspecifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate\r\nmeasurement of these performance metrics in MPLS networks.
