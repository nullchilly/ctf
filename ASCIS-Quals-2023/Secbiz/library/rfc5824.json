Some service providers will deploy services that\r\nrequest Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees from a local Customer Edge\r\n(CE) to a remote CE across the network.  As a result, the application (e.g.,\r\nvoice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe, etc.) requirements for an\r\nend-to-end QoS and reserving an adequate bandwidth continue to increase.\r\n\r\nService providers can use both an MPLS and an MPLS Traffic Engineering\r\n(MPLS-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to meet their service objectives.  This\r\ndocument describes service-provider requirements for supporting a customer\r\nResource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) and RSVP-TE over a BGP\/MPLS IP-VPN.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2010","keywords":["triple-play service"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5824","errata_url":null}
