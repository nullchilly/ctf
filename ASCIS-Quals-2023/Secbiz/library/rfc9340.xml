      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet
     technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on
     Earth. To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from
     the ground up to account for the fundamentally new properties of quantum
     entanglement. The first quantum entanglement networks have been realised,
     but there is no practical proposal for how to
     organise, utilise, and manage such networks. In this document, we attempt to
     lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles
     for a quantum internet. This is intended for general guidance and general
     interest.  It is also intended to provide a foundation for discussion between
     physicists and network specialists. This document is a product of the
     Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG).</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Quantum networks are distributed systems of quantum devices that
     utilise fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition,
     entanglement, and quantum measurement to achieve capabilities beyond what
     is possible with non-quantum (classical) networks <xref target="Kimble08" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Kimble08"/>. Depending on the stage of a quantum network <xref target="Wehner18" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Wehner18"/>,
     such devices may range from simple photonic devices capable of preparing
     and measuring only one quantum bit (qubit) at a time all the way to
     large-scale quantum computers of the future. A quantum network is not
     meant to replace classical networks but rather to form an overall hybrid
     classical-quantum network supporting new capabilities that are otherwise
     impossible to realise <xref target="VanMeterBook" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VanMeterBook"/>. For example, the
     most well-known application of quantum communication, Quantum Key
     Distribution (QKD) <xref target="QKD" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="QKD"/>, can create and distribute a pair of symmetric
     encryption keys in such a way that the security of the entire process
     relies on the laws of physics (and thus can be mathematically proven to be
     unbreakable) rather than the intractability of certain mathematical
     problems <xref target="Bennett14" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Bennett14"/> <xref target="Ekert91" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Ekert91"/>. Small
     networks capable of QKD have even already been deployed at short (roughly
     100-kilometre) distances <xref target="Elliott03" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Elliott03"/> <xref target="Peev09" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Peev09"/>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The quantum networking paradigm also offers promise for a range of new
     applications beyond quantum cryptography, such as distributed quantum
     computation <xref target="Cirac99" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Cirac99"/> <xref target="Crepeau02" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Crepeau02"/>; secure

     higher-precision, long-baseline telescopes <xref target="Gottesman12" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Gottesman12"/>.
     These applications are much more demanding than QKD, and networks capable
     of executing them are in their infancy. The first fully quantum, multinode
     network capable of sending, receiving, and manipulating distributed
     quantum information has only recently been realised <xref target="Pompili21.1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Pompili21.1"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Whilst a lot of effort has gone into physically realising and
     connecting such devices, and making improvements to their speed and error
     tolerance, no proposals for how to run these networks have been worked out at the time of this writing. To draw an analogy with a classical network, we are at a stage
     where we can start to physically connect our devices and send data, but
     all sending, receiving, buffer management, connection synchronisation, and
     so on must be managed by the application directly by using low-level,
     custom-built, and hardware-specific interfaces, rather than being managed
     by a network stack that exposes a convenient high-level interface, such as
     sockets. Only recently was the first-ever attempt at such a network stack
     experimentally demonstrated in a laboratory setting <xref target="Pompili21.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Pompili21.2"/>. Furthermore, whilst physical mechanisms for
     transmitting quantum information exist, there are no robust protocols for
     managing such transmissions.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document, produced by the Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG),
     introduces quantum networks and presents general guidelines for the design
     and construction of such networks. Overall, it is intended as an
     introduction to the subject for network engineers and researchers. It
     should not be considered as a conclusive statement on how quantum networks
     should or will be implemented. This document was discussed on the QIRG
     mailing list and several IETF meetings.  It represents the consensus of the
     QIRG members, of both experts in the subject matter (from the quantum and

     understanding of quantum information theory is necessary. The following
     sections aim to introduce the minimum amount of knowledge necessary to
     understand the principles of operation of a quantum network. This
     exposition was written with a classical networking audience in mind. It is

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-1">A quantum mechanical system is described by its quantum state. A
       quantum state is an abstract object that provides a complete description
       of the system at that particular moment. When combined with the rules of
       the system's evolution in time, such as a quantum circuit, it also then
       provides a complete description of the system at all times. For the
       purposes of computing and networking, the classical equivalent of a
       quantum state would be a string or stream of logical bit values. These
       bits provide a complete description of what values we can read out from
       that string at that particular moment, and when combined with its rules
       for evolution in time, such as a logical circuit, we will also know its
       value at any other time.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-2">Just like a single classical bit, a quantum mechanical system can be
       simple and consist of a single particle, e.g., an atom or a photon of
       light. In this case, the quantum state provides the complete description
       of that one particle. Similarly, just like a string of bits consists of
       multiple bits, a single quantum state can be used to also describe an
       ensemble of many particles. However, because quantum states are governed
       by the laws of quantum mechanics, their behaviour is significantly
       different to that of a string of bits. In this section, we will summarise
       the key concepts to understand these differences.  We will then explain
       their consequences for networking in the rest of this document.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-1">The differences between quantum computation and classical computation
       begin at the bit level. A classical computer operates on the binary
       alphabet { 0, 1 }.  A quantum bit, called a qubit, exists over the same
       binary space, but unlike the classical bit, its state can exist in a
       superposition of the two possibilities:</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-2">|qubit⟩ = a |0⟩ + b |1⟩,</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-3">where |X⟩ is Dirac's ket notation for a quantum state (the value that
       a qubit holds) -- here, the binary 0 and 1 -- and the coefficients a and b
       are complex numbers called probability amplitudes. Physically, such a
       state can be realised using a variety of different technologies such as
       electron spin, photon polarisation, atomic energy levels, and so on.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-4">Upon measurement, the qubit loses its superposition and irreversibly
       collapses into one of the two basis states, either |0⟩ or |1⟩. Which of
       the two states it ends up in may not be deterministic but can be
       determined from the readout of the measurement. The measurement result
       is a classical bit, 0 or 1, corresponding to |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively.
       The probability of measuring the state in the |0⟩ state is |a|<sup>2</sup>;
       similarly, the probability of measuring the state in the |1⟩ state is
       |⁠b⁠|⁠<sup>2</sup>, where |a|<sup>2</sup> + |b|<sup>2</sup> = 1. This randomness is not due to our
       ignorance of the underlying mechanisms but rather is a fundamental
       feature of a quantum mechanical system <xref target="Aspect81" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Aspect81"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-5">The superposition property plays an important role in fundamental
       gate operations on qubits. Since a qubit can exist in a superposition of
       its basis states, the elementary quantum gates are able to act on all
       states of the superposition at the same time. For example, consider the
       NOT gate:</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-6">NOT (a |0⟩ + b |1⟩) → a |1⟩ + b |0⟩.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-7">It is important to note that "qubit" can have two meanings. In the
       first meaning, "qubit" refers to a physical quantum <strong>system</strong> whose
       quantum state can be expressed as a superposition of two basis states,
       which we often label |0⟩ and |1⟩. Here, "qubit" refers to a physical
       implementation akin to what a flip-flop, switch, voltage, or current
       would be for a classical bit. In the second meaning, "qubit" refers to
       the abstract quantum <strong>state</strong> of a quantum system with such two basis
       states. In this case, the meaning of "qubit" is akin to the logical
       value of a bit, from classical computing, i.e., "logical 0" or "logical
       1". The two concepts are related, because a physical "qubit" (first
       meaning) can be used to store the abstract "qubit" (second meaning).
       Both meanings are used interchangeably in literature, and the meaning is
       generally clear from the context.</t>

       of possible states grows exponentially and all these states can coexist
       in a superposition. For example, the general form of a two-qubit
       register is</t>

       interpretation as for the single-qubit state. Each state represents a
       possible outcome of a measurement of the two-qubit register. For

       |0⟩ and the second is in the state |1⟩.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3-4">Performing single-qubit gates affects the relevant qubit in each of

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3-13">What is so interesting about this two-qubit gate operation? The final
       state is <strong>entangled</strong>.  There is no possible way of representing that
       quantum state as a product of two individual qubits; they are no longer
       independent. That is, it is not possible to describe the quantum state
       of either of the individual qubits in a way that is independent of the
       other qubit. Only the quantum state of the system that consists of both
       qubits provides a physically complete description of the two-qubit
       system. The states of the two individual qubits are now correlated
       beyond what is possible to achieve classically. Neither qubit is in a
       definite |0⟩ or |1⟩ state, but if we perform a measurement on either
       one, the outcome of the partner qubit will <strong>always</strong> yield the exact same
       outcome. The final state, whether it's |00⟩ or |11⟩, is fundamentally
       random as before, but the states of the two qubits following a
       measurement will always be identical. One can think of this as flipping
       two coins, but both coins always land on "heads" or both land on
       "tails" together -- something that we know is impossible classically.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3-14">Once a measurement is performed, the two qubits are once again
       independent. The final state is either |00⟩ or |11⟩, and both of these
       states can be trivially decomposed into a product of two individual
       qubits. The entanglement has been consumed, and the entangled state must
       be prepared again.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-7">The first stems from the fact that entanglement enables
     stronger-than-classical correlations, leading to opportunities for tasks that require
     coordination. As a trivial example, consider the problem of consensus
     between two nodes who want to agree on the value of a single bit. They can
     use the quantum network to prepare the state (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/sqrt(2) with
     each node holding one of the two qubits. Once either of the two nodes
     performs a measurement, the state of the two qubits collapses to either
     |00⟩ or |11⟩, so whilst the outcome is random and does not exist before
     measurement, the two nodes will always measure the same value. We can also
     build the more general multi-qubit state (|00...⟩ + |11...⟩)/sqrt(2) and

         Fidelity is an important property of a quantum system that allows us

       teleportation <xref target="Bennett93" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Bennett93"/>. Quantum state teleportation
       consumes an unknown qubit state that we want to transmit and recreates

       performs a readout of the two qubits (the sum of these operations is
       called a Bell state measurement). This consumes the Bell pair's
       entanglement, turning the source and destination qubits into independent
       states. The measurement yields two classical bits, which the source
       sends to the destination over a classical channel. Based on the value of
       the received two classical bits, the destination performs one of four
       possible corrections (called the Pauli corrections) on its end of the
       pair, which turns it into the unknown qubit state that we wanted to
       transmit. This requirement to communicate the measurement readout over

           In most classical networks, including Ethernet, Internet Protocol
           (IP), and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, user data
           is grouped into packets. In addition to the user data, each packet
           also contains a series of headers that contain the control
           information that lets routers and switches forward it towards its
           destination. Packets are the fundamental unit in a classical
           network.

           In a quantum network, the entangled pairs of qubits are the basic
           unit of networking. These qubits themselves do not carry any
           headers. Therefore, quantum networks will have to send all control
           information via separate classical channels, which the repeaters will
           have to correlate with the qubits stored in their memory.
           Furthermore, unlike a classical packet, which is located at a single
           node, a Bell pair consists of two qubits distributed across two
           nodes. This has a fundamental impact on how quantum networks
           will be managed and how protocols need to be designed. To make
           long-distance Bell pairs, the nodes may have to keep their qubits in
           their quantum memories and wait until control information is
           exchanged before proceeding with the next operation. This signalling
           will result in additional latency, which will depend on the distance
           between the nodes holding the two ends of the Bell pair. Error

           frames of classical networks. This phenomenological distinction
           leads to architectural differences between quantum networks and
           classical networks. Quantum networks combine multiple elementary
           link Bell pairs together to create one end-to-end Bell pair, whereas

           Classical networks receive data on one interface, store it in local
           buffers, and then forward the data to another appropriate interface.
           Quantum networks store Bell pairs and then execute entanglement
           swapping instead of forwarding in the data plane. Such quantum
           networks are "store and swap" networks. In "store and swap"
           networks, we do not need to care about the order in which the Bell
           pairs were generated, since they are undirected. However, whilst the
           ordering does not matter, it is very important that the right
           entangled pairs get swapped, and that the intermediate measurement
           outcomes (see <xref target="es" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.4.2"/>) are signalled to and correlated
           with the correct qubits at the other nodes. Otherwise, the final
           end-to-end entangled pair will not be created between the expected
           end-points or will be in a different quantum state than expected.
           For example, rather than Alice receiving a qubit that is entangled
           with Bob's qubit, her qubit is entangled with Charlie's qubit. This
           distinction makes control algorithms and optimisation of quantum
           networks different from those for classical networks, in the sense that swapping

           Fortunately, from an application's point of view, as long as the

           cryptographic protocols do not need the network to provide any

           it is important to note that whilst classical networks are necessary
           to establish these end-to-end guarantees, the security relies on the

           classical message) that the server measure them in an encoded basis. The client
           then decodes the results it receives from the server to obtain the

     The data plane abstractions in quantum networks will be very different
     from those in classical networks due to the fundamental differences in
     technology and the stateful nature of quantum networks. In fact, choosing
     the right abstractions will be one of the biggest challenges when
     designing interoperable quantum network protocols.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-11">In quantum networks, control plane traffic (routing and signalling
     messages) is exchanged over a classical channel, whereas data plane
     traffic (the actual Bell pair qubits) is exchanged over a separate quantum
     channel. This is in contrast to most classical networks, where control
     plane traffic and data plane traffic share the same channel and where a
     single packet contains both user fields and header fields. There is,
     however, a classical analogy to the way quantum networks work: generalised
     MPLS (GMPLS) networks use separate channels for control plane traffic and
     data plane traffic. Furthermore, GMPLS networks support data planes where
     there is no such thing as data plane headers (e.g., Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) or Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
     networks).</t>

            <t indent="0">The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture. This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t>
