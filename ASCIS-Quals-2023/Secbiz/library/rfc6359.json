Extending the Datatracker to hold document data from I-D version -00 to\r\nRFC allows for increased automation between the Datatracker, IANA, and RFC\r\nEditor, thus reducing manual labor, processing errors, and potential\r\ndelay.  Therefore, this document also describes the requirements to make such\r\nautomation possible.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2011","keywords":["id-tracker","backend extensions"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6359","errata_url":null}
