Additionally, it provides a\r\ndiscussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in\r\npractice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer\r\napplicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based\r\nfiltering adoption and IRR utility to this day.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["Resource Certification","Internet Routing Registry","IRR","Routing Policy Specification Language","RPSL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7682","errata_url":null}
