These authentication signaling messages between the\r\nmobile node and home agent are secured by an IPsec security\r\nassociation (SA) that is established between the MN and HA.  The MIP6\r\nworking group has specified a mechanism to secure the Binding Update\r\n(BU) and Binding Acknowledgement (BAck) messages using an\r\nauthentication option, similar to the authentication option in Mobile\r\nIPv4, carried within the signaling messages that are exchanged\r\nbetween the MN and HA to establish a binding.  This document provides\r\nthe justifications as to why the authentication option mechanism is\r\nneeded for Mobile IPv6 deployment in certain environments.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2009","keywords":["authentication signaling message","mn","ha"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5419","errata_url":null}
