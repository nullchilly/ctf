The specifications of these protocols contain\r\nfields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its\r\nresearch work, the group created ad hoc registries.  As the\r\nspecifications are stable and have multiple interoperable\r\nimplementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to\r\nIANA for official custody.  This document describes the actions\r\nexecuted by IANA.
