Pelletier"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"16","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Robust Header Compression","abstract":" The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC (RFC 3095) defines a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles) for IP\/UDP\/RTP, IP\/ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), IP\/UDP, and also a profile for uncompressed packet streams.  However, no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as a missing piece in RFC 3095.  This document defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP\/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP, and enhanced to compress IP header chains of arbitrary length.
