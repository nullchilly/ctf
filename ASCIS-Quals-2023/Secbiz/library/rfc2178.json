OSPF is a\r\nlink-state routing protocol.  It is designed to be run internal to\r\na single Autonomous System.  Each OSPF router maintains an identical\r\ndatabase describing the Autonomous System's topology.  From this\r\ndatabase, a routing table is calculated by constructing a\r\nshortest-path tree.\r\n\r\nOSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological changes,\r\nutilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.  OSPF provides\r\nsupport for equal-cost multipath.  An area routing capability is\r\nprovided, enabling an additional level of routing protection and a\r\nreduction in routing protocol traffic.  In addition, all OSPF\r\nrouting protocol exchanges are authenticated.
