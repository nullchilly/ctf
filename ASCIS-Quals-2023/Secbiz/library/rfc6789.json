It explains the\r\nmotivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose\r\ninformation about congestion to network nodes.  Although such\r\ninformation may have a number of uses, this document focuses on how\r\nthe information communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the\r\nbasis for significantly more efficient and effective traffic\r\nmanagement than what exists on the Internet today.
