Currently,\r\nthe Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol only supports\r\nmapping locations to a single service based on service regions.  This\r\ndocument describes an extension that allows queries of the type \"N\r\nnearest\", \"within distance X\", and \"served by\".  This document defines \r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2011","keywords":["location-based services","location","GPS","point of interest"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6451","errata_url":null}
