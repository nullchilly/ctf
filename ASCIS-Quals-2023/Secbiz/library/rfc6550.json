LLN routers\r\ntypically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and\r\nenergy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by\r\nhigh loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised\r\nof anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported\r\ntraffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the\r\nLLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset\r\nof devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices\r\ninside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document\r\nspecifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks\r\n(RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic\r\nfrom devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well\r\nas point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the\r\ndevices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point\r\ntraffic is also available.
