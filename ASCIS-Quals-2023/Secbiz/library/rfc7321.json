It also adds usage guidance to help in\r\nthe selection of these algorithms.\r\n\r\nESP and AH protocols make use of various cryptographic algorithms to\r\nprovide confidentiality and\/or data origin authentication to\r\nprotected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec)\r\narchitecture.  To ensure interoperability between disparate\r\nimplementations, the IPsec standard specifies a set of mandatory-to-\r\nimplement algorithms.  This document specifies the current set of\r\nmandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies\r\nalgorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to\r\nmandatory at some future time, and also recommends against the\r\nimplementation of some obsolete algorithms.  Usage guidance is also\r\nprovided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their security\r\ngoals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC4835"],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8221"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7321","errata_url":null}
