Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as IEEE\r\n802.1ah-2008.  It aims to improve the scalability of Media Access\r\nControl (MAC) addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet\r\nnetworks.  This document describes different interoperability\r\nscenarios where Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in\r\nH-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better\r\nscalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of\r\nservice instances.  The document also describes the scenarios and the\r\nmechanisms for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality\r\nwithin H-VPLS with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among\r\nthem.  Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms\r\nand scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality can be\r\nincorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":["h-vpls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7080","errata_url":null}
