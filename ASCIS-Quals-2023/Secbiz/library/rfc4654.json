TFMCC is a congestion control mechanism for\r\nmulticast transmissions in a best-effort Internet environment.\r\nIt is a single-rate congestion control scheme, where the\r\nsending rate is adapted to the receiver experiencing the worst\r\nnetwork conditions.  TFMCC is reasonably fair when competing\r\nfor bandwidth with TCP flows and has a relatively low\r\nvariation of throughput over time, making it suitable for\r\napplications where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance,\r\nsuch as streaming media.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2006","keywords":["[--------|e]","streaming media","multicase","ip","internet protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4654","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4654"}
