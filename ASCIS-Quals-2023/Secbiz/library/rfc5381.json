It describes an alternative SOAP\r\nbinding for NETCONF that does not interoperate with an RFC 4743\r\nconformant implementation making use of cookies on top of the\r\npersistent transport connections of HTTP.  When SOAP is used as a\r\ntransport protocol for NETCONF, various kinds of development tools\r\nare available.  By making full use of these tools, developers can\r\nsignificantly reduce their workload.  The authors developed an NMS\r\n(Network Management System) and network equipment that can deal with\r\nNETCONF messages sent over SOAP.  This document aims to provide\r\nNETCONF development guidelines gained from the experience of\r\nimplementing a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":["simple object access protocol","network configuration protocol","mns","network management system"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5381","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5381"}
