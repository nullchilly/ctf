In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically\r\nanchored at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for\r\nregistered mobile nodes.  The setup and maintenance of localized\r\nrouting, which allows forwarding of data packets between two mobile\r\nnodes' Mobility Access Gateways without involvement of their Local\r\nMobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered.  This document\r\ndescribes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile\r\nIPv6.
