It is based on\r\nthe exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in\r\nthis document allows end systems to apply protection using various\r\nprotection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection\r\ngroup sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics.\r\nIt enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial\r\nrecovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet\r\nloss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with\r\nnon-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do\r\nnot implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection\r\ndata.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC\r\nspecified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733\r\nand RFC 3009.
