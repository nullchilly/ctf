This can be addressed by\r\ntransmitting the umask and create mode as separate pieces of data,\r\nallowing the server to make more intelligent decisions about the\r\npermissions to set on new files.  This document proposes a protocol\r\nextension to accomplish that.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8275","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8275"}
