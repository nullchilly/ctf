Provisions exist for\r\nfragmenting large amounts of authentication data across multiple\r\npackets, via Access-Challenge packets.  No similar provisions exist\r\nfor fragmenting large amounts of authorization data.  This document\r\nspecifies how existing RADIUS mechanisms can be leveraged to provide\r\nthat functionality.  These mechanisms are largely compatible with\r\nexisting implementations, and they are designed to be invisible to\r\nproxies and \"fail-safe\" to legacy RADIUS Clients and Servers.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["RADIUS","attribute","extension","fragmentation","chunk"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7499","errata_url":null}
