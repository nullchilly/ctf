Diffserv is based on network\r\nnodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP\r\nheaders are marked with different Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs).\r\nWebRTC applications, as well as some conferencing applications, have\r\nbegun using the Session Description Protocol (SDP) bundle negotiation\r\nmechanism to send multiple traffic streams with different QoS\r\nrequirements using the same network 5-tuple.  The results of using\r\nmultiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single\r\nnetwork 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly\r\nwith congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering).  In\r\naddition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic\r\nsource and destination.  This memo covers the implications of these\r\nDiffserv aspects for real-time network communication, including\r\nWebRTC.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["Diffserv","DSCP","RAI","RTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7657","errata_url":null}
