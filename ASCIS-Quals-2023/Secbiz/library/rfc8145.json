These digital signatures can be verified by building a\r\nchain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\r\nparticular node in the DNS.  This document specifies two different\r\nways for validating resolvers to signal to a server which keys are\r\nreferenced in their chain of trust.  The data from such signaling\r\nallow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a\r\nDNSSEC-signed zone.","pub_date":"April 2017","keywords":["DNS","DNSSEC","Trust Anchor"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8553"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8145","errata_url":null}
