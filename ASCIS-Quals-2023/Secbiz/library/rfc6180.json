An\r\nexpansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its\r\nincrease in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a\r\nsubnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real\r\noption on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort,\r\nresources, and expertise.  The availability of many different\r\ndeployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This\r\ndocument discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools,\r\nand it recommends ones that have been found to work well in\r\noperational networks in many common situations.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6180","errata_url":null}
