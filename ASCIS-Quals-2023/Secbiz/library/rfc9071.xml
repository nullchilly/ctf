This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified in RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model, enabling source identification and rapidly
interleaved transmission of text from different sources. The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time text session. The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the Contributing Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet for source identification. The method makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-party sessions.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">
Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP-mixer model. The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the fully specified solution in this document because it can be applied to a wide range of existing RTP implementations.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-3">
 A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multiparty-coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method. The capability is indicated by the use of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media attribute, "rtt-mixer".
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-4">
This document updates RFC 4103 ("RTP Payload for Text Conversation").
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-5">
 A specification for how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multiparty aware is also provided.

specifies the use of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/> for transmission of real-time text (often called RTT) and the "text/t140" format. It also specifies a redundancy format, "text/red", for increased robustness. The "text/red" format is registered in <xref target="RFC4102" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4102"/>.
</t>

  Real-time text is usually provided together with audio and sometimes with video in conversational sessions.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
A requirement related to multiparty sessions from the presentation-level standard T.140 <xref target="T140" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="T140"/> for real-time text is as follows:</t>
      <blockquote pn="section-1-4">The display of text from the members of the conversation should be arranged so that the text from
each participant is clearly readable, and its source and the relative timing of entered text is visualized
in the display.</blockquote>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">
Another requirement is that the mixing procedure must not introduce delays in the text streams that could be perceived as disruptive to the real-time experience of the receiving users.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">
The use of real-time text is increasing, and specifically, use in emergency calls is increasing.  Emergency call use requires multiparty mixing, because it is common that one agent needs to transfer the call to another specialized agent but is obliged to stay on the call to at least verify that the transfer was successful. Mixer implementations for RFC 4103 ("RTP Payload for Text Conversation") can use traditional RTP functions (RFC 3550) for mixing and source identification, but the performance of the mixer when giving turns for the different sources to transmit is limited when using the default transmission characteristics with redundancy.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">
The redundancy scheme described in <xref target="RFC4103" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4103"/> enables efficient transmission of earlier transmitted redundant text in packets together with new text. However, the redundancy header format has no source indicators for the redundant transmissions. The redundant parts in a packet must therefore be from the same source as the new text. The recommended transmission is one new and two redundant generations of text (T140blocks) in each packet, and the recommended transmission interval for two-party use is 300 ms.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">
Real-time text mixers for multiparty sessions need to include the
source with each transmitted group of text from a conference participant so that the text can be transmitted interleaved with text groups from different sources at the rate at which they are created. This enables the text groups to be presented by endpoints in a suitable grouping with other text from the same source. 
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-9">
The presentation can then be arranged so that text from different sources can be presented in real time and easily read. At the same time, it is possible for a reading user to perceive approximately when the text was created in real time by the different parties. The transmission and mixing are intended to be done in a general way, so that presentation can be arranged in a layout decided upon by the receiving endpoint.

</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-10">
Existing implementations of RFC 4103 in endpoints that do not implement the updates specified in this document cannot be expected to properly present real-time text mixed for multiparty-aware endpoints.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-11">
        A negotiation mechanism is therefore needed to verify if the parties
(1) are able to handle a common method for multiparty transmissions and
(2) can agree on using that method.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-12">
        A fallback mixing procedure is also needed for cases when the negotiation result indicates that a receiving endpoint is not capable of handling the mixed format. Multiparty-unaware endpoints would possibly otherwise present all received multiparty mixed text as if it came from the same source regardless of any accompanying source indication coded in fields in the packet. Or, they may have other undesirable ways of acting on the multiparty content. The fallback method is called the mixing procedure for multiparty-unaware endpoints. The fallback method is naturally not expected to meet all performance requirements placed on the mixing procedure for multiparty-aware endpoints.

One RTP stream per source would be sent in the same RTP session with the "text/red" format.
   From some points of view, the use of multiple RTP streams, one for each source, sent in the same RTP session would be efficient and would use exactly the same packet format as <xref target="RFC4103" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4103"/> and the same payload type.
   A couple of relevant scenarios using multiple RTP streams are specified in
"<xref target="RFC7667" format="title" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RTP Topologies"/>" <xref target="RFC7667" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7667"/>. One possibility of special interest is the Selective Forwarding Middlebox (SFM) topology specified in 
<xref target="RFC7667" sectionFormat="of" section="3.7" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7667#section-3.7" derivedContent="RFC7667"/>,
which could enable end-to-end encryption. In contrast to audio and video, real-time text is only transmitted when the users actually transmit information. Thus, an SFM solution would not need to exclude any party from transmission under normal conditions. In order to allow the mixer to convey the packets with the payload preserved and encrypted, an SFM solution would need to act on some specific characteristics of the "text/red" format. The redundancy headers are part of the payload, so the receiver would need to just assume that the payload type number in the redundancy header is for "text/t140". The characters per second ("cps") parameter would need to act per stream. The relationship between the SSRC and the source would need to be conveyed in some specified way, e.g., in the CSRC. Recovery and loss detection would preferably be based on RTP sequence number gap detection. Thus, sequence number gaps in the incoming stream to the mixer would need to be reflected in the stream to the participant, with no new gaps created by the mixer.    
   However, the RTP implementation in both mixers and endpoints needs to support multiple streams in the same RTP session in order to use this mechanism. To provide the best opportunities for deployment, it should be possible to upgrade existing endpoint solutions to be multiparty aware with a reasonable amount of effort. There is currently a lack of support for multi-stream RTP in certain implementations. This fact led to only brief mention of this solution in this document as an option for further study.

   RTP-mixer-based method for multiparty-aware endpoints:

 The "text/red" format as defined in RFC 4102 and applied in RFC 4103 is sent with the RTP-mixer method indicating the source in the CSRC field.
 The "text/red" format with a "text/t140" payload in a single RTP stream can be sent when text is available from the call participants instead of at the regular 300 ms intervals. Transmission of packets with text from different sources can then be done smoothly while simultaneous transmission occurs as long as it is not limited by the maximum character rate "cps" value. With ten participants sending text simultaneously, the switching and transmission performance is good. With more simultaneously sending participants and with receivers at default capacity, there will be a noticeable jerkiness and delay in text presentation. The more participants who send text
simultaneously, the more jerkiness will occur. Two seconds of jerkiness will be noticeable and slightly unpleasant, but it corresponds in time to what typing humans often cause by hesitating or changing position while typing. A benefit of this method is that no new packet format needs to be introduced and implemented. Since simultaneous typing by more than two parties is expected to be very rare -- as described in <xref target="intendedapp" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 1.3"/> -- this method can be used successfully with good performance. Recovery of text in the case of packet loss is based on analysis of timestamps of received redundancy versus earlier received text. Negotiation is based on a new SDP media attribute, "rtt-mixer". This method was selected to be the main method specified in this document.

The sources would be indicated in strict order in the CSRC list of the RTP packets. The CSRC list can have up to 15 members. Therefore, text from up to 15 sources can be included in each packet. Packets are normally sent at 300 ms intervals. The mean delay would be 150 ms. A new redundancy packet format would be specified. This method would result in good performance but would require standardization and implementation of new releases in the target technologies; these would take more time than desirable to complete.

The presentation of text from multiple parties is prepared by the mixer in one single stream. 
  It is desirable to have a method that does not require any modifications in existing user devices implementing RFC 4103 for real-time text without explicit support of multiparty sessions. This is made possible by having the mixer insert a new line and a
text-formatted source label before each switch of text source in the stream. Switching the source can only be done in places in the text where it does not disturb the perception of the contents. Text from only one source at a time can be presented in real time. The delay will therefore vary. In calls where parties take turns properly by ending their entries with a new line, the limitations will have limited influence on the user experience. When only two parties send text, these two will see the text in real time with no delay. Although this method also has other limitations, it is included in this document as a fallback method.

        The method for multiparty real-time text specified in this document is primarily intended for use in transmissions between mixers and endpoints in centralized mixing configurations. It is also applicable between mixers. An
often-mentioned application is for emergency service calls with real-time text and voice, where a call taker wants to make an attended handover of a call to another agent and stay on the call to observe the session. Multimedia conference sessions with support for participants to contribute with text is another example.  Conferences with central support for speech-to-text conversion represent yet another example.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.3-2">
          In all these applications, normally only one participant at a time will send long text comments. In some cases, one other participant will occasionally contribute with a longer comment simultaneously. That may also happen in some rare cases when text is translated to text in another language in a conference. Apart from these cases, other participants are only expected to contribute with very brief comments while others are sending text.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.3-3">
                Users expect the text they send to be presented in real time in a readable way to the other participants even if they send simultaneously with other users and even when they make brief edit operations of their text by backspacing and correcting their text.

          Text is supposed to be human generated, by some means of text input, such as typing on a keyboard or using speech-to-text technology. Occasional small cut-and-paste operations may appear even if that is not the initial purpose of real-time text.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.3-5">
          The real-time characteristics of real-time text are essential for the participants to be able to contribute to a conversation. If the text is delayed too much between the typing of a character and its presentation, then, in some conference situations, the opportunity to comment will be gone and someone else will grab the turn. A delay of more than one second in such situations is an obstacle to good conversation.

 This method requires the mixer to insert text dividers and readable

      This solution has good performance with low text delays, as long as the mean number of characters per second sent during any 10-second interval from a number of simultaneously sending participants to a receiving participant does not reach the "cps" value. At higher numbers of sent characters per second, a jerkiness is visible in the presentation of text. The solution is therefore suitable for emergency service use, relay service use, and small or well-managed larger multimedia conferences.  In large unmanaged conferences with a high number of participants only, on very rare occasions, situations might arise where many participants happen to send text simultaneously. In such circumstances, the result may be unpleasantly jerky presentation of text from each sending participant. It should be noted that it is only the number of users sending text within the same moment that causes jerkiness, not the total number of users with real-time text capability.

    When a multiparty-unaware endpoint presents a conversation in one display area in a chat style, it inserts source indications for remote text and local user text as they are merged in completed text groups. When an endpoint using this layout receives and presents text mixed for multiparty-unaware endpoints, there will be two levels of source indicators for the received text: one generated by the mixer and inserted in a label after each source switch, and another generated by the receiving endpoint and inserted after each switch between the local source and the remote source in the presentation area.

    New text can be presented from only one source at a time. Switching the source to be presented takes place at suitable places in the text, such as the end of a phrase, the end of a sentence, or a Line Separator, or upon detecting inactivity.

        In the very unlikely event that many participants in a conference send text simultaneously for a long period of time, a delay may build up for the presentation of text at the receivers if the limitation in characters per second ("cps") to be transmitted to the participants is exceeded. A delay of more than 15 seconds can cause confusion in the session.

 If the main text contributor is indicated in any way, the mixer <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> avoid deleting text from that participant.

The RTP-mixer model requires the mixer to be allowed to decrypt, pack, and encrypt secured text from conference participants. Therefore, the mixer needs to be trusted
to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the real-time text data. This situation is similar to the situation for handling audio and video media in centralized mixers.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">
The requirement to transfer information about the user in RTCP reports in SDES, CNAME, and NAME fields, and in conference notifications, may have privacy concerns, as already stated in RFC 3550 <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/>, and may be restricted for privacy reasons. When used for the creation of readable labels in the presentation, the receiving user will then get a more symbolic label for the source.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-3">
          The services available through the real-time text mixer may be of special interest to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Some users may want to refrain from revealing such characteristics broadly in conferences. Conference systems where the mixer is included <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> need to be designed with the confidentiality of such characteristics in mind.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">
          Participants with malicious intentions may appear and, for example, disrupt the multiparty session by emitting a continuous flow of text. They may also send text that appears to originate from other participants. Countermeasures should include requiring secure signaling, media, and authentication, and providing higher-layer conference functions, e.g., for blocking, muting, and expelling participants. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-5">
          Participants with malicious intentions may also try to disrupt the presentation by sending incomplete or malformed control codes. Handling of text from the different sources by the receivers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> therefore be well separated so that the effects of such actions only affect text from the source causing the action. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-6">
          Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of attacks by
unauthenticated call participants, and even eavesdropping and manipulation of content by non-participants, if the use of the mixer is permitted for users both with and without security procedures.

          As already stated in <xref target="security2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.18"/>, security in media <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be applied by using DTLS-SRTP <xref target="RFC5764" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5764"/> at the media level.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

              <t indent="0">The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification, and termination of media sessions between user agents. These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.  Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications sessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated.  This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur.  This framework describes the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t indent="0">This specification defines conferencing call control features for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This document builds on the Conferencing Requirements and Framework documents to define how a tightly coupled SIP conference works.  The approach is explored from the perspective of different user agent (UA) types: conference-unaware, conference-aware, and focus UAs.  The use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities discovery, and call control using REFER are covered in detail with example call flow diagrams.  The usage of the isfocus feature tag is defined.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

              <t indent="0">Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) is an implementation of the Opportunistic Security mechanism, as defined in RFC 7435, applied to the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  OSRTP allows encrypted media to be used in environments where support for encryption is not known in advance and is not required.  OSRTP does not require Session Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features and is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations using encrypted and authenticated media and implementations that do not encrypt or authenticate media packets.  OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for Secure RTP (SRTP).  OSRTP is a transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments of real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated state.</t>

              <t indent="0">In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees. This document defines a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that uses two separate but related cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.</t>
