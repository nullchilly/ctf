This is required, for example,\r\nif media data is separated and transported in different network streams\r\nas a result of the use of a layered or multiple descriptive media coding\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nA new grouping type \"DDP\" -- decoding dependency -- is defined, to be\r\nused in conjunction with RFC 3388 entitled \"Grouping of Media Lines in\r\nthe Session Description Protocol\".  In addition, an attribute is\r\nspecified describing the relationship of the media streams in a \"DDP\"\r\ngroup indicated by media identification attribute(s) and media format\r\ndescription(s).
