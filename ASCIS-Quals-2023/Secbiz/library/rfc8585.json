The document only covers\r\nIPv4aaS, i.e., transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in\r\nIPv6-only access networks.  IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't\r\nsufficient IPv4 addresses available for every possible customer\/\r\ndevice.  However, devices or applications in the customer Local Area\r\nNetworks (LANs) may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to\r\ncommunicate with IPv4-only services on the Internet.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["IPv6 transition","CE requirements","IPv4aaS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8585","errata_url":null}
