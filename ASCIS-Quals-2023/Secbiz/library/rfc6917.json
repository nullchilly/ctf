The Session Initiation Protocol\r\n(SIP) is used as the signaling protocol that provides many inherent\r\ncapabilities for message routing.  In addition to such signaling\r\nproperties, a need exists for intelligent, application-level media\r\nservice selection based on non-static signaling properties.  This is\r\nespecially true when considered in conjunction with deployment\r\narchitectures that include 1:M and M:N combinations of Application\r\nServers and Media Servers.  This document introduces a Media Resource\r\nBroker (MRB) entity, which manages the availability of Media Servers\r\nand the media resource demands of Application Servers.  The document\r\nincludes potential deployment options for an MRB and appropriate\r\ninterfaces to Application Servers and Media Servers.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6917","errata_url":null}
