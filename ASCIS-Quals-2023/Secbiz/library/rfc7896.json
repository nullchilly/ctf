RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to\r\nspecify network elements to be traversed in the computed path.  The\r\nspecification does not specify if the IRO contains an ordered or\r\nunordered list of subobjects.  During recent discussions, it was\r\ndetermined that there was a need to define a standard representation\r\nto ensure interoperability.  It was also noted that there is a\r\nbenefit in the handling of an attribute of the IRO's subobject, the L\r\nbit.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5440 regarding the IRO specification.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["PCEP","PCE","IRO"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5440"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7896","errata_url":null}
