Arnold"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"40","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Session Initiation Protocol Core","abstract":"This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be\r\nused to wake a suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent\r\n(UA) with push notifications, and it also describes how the UA can\r\nsend binding-refresh REGISTER requests and receive incoming SIP\r\nrequests in an environment in which the UA may be suspended.  The\r\ndocument defines new SIP URI parameters to exchange PNS information\r\nbetween the UA and the SIP entity that will then request that push\r\nnotifications be sent to the UA.  It also defines the parameters to\r\ntrigger such push notification requests.  The document also defines\r\nnew feature-capability indicators that can be used to indicate\r\nsupport of this mechanism.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["SIP","Push","Notification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8599","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8599"}
