Some of these types of\r\nservices require call preemption; others require call queuing or\r\nother mechanisms.  IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC)\r\nprocedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of\r\nthis architecture.  Such a CAC procedure and PHB is\r\nappropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up\r\nreal-time sessions.  The key requirement is to guarantee an elevated\r\nprobability of call completion to an authorized user in time of crisis.\r\n\r\nThis document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context of\r\nthe US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level\r\nPrecedence and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS)\r\nstandards.  The architectures described here are applicable beyond\r\nthese organizations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2006","keywords":["ieps","internet emergency preparedness service","call admission control","cac","phb","per hop behavior","multi-level precedence and preemption","mlpp","government emergency telecommunication service","gets"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC5865"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4542","errata_url":null}
