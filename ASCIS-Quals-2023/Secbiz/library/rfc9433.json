The network\r\nprogramming nature of SRv6 accomplishes mobile user-plane functions\r\nin a simple manner.  The statelessness of SRv6 and its ability to\r\ncontrol both service layer path and underlying transport can be\r\nbeneficial to the mobile user plane, providing flexibility,\r\nend-to-end network slicing, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) control\r\nfor various applications. \r\n\r\nThis document discusses how SRv6 could be used as the user plane of\r\nmobile networks. This document also specifies the SRv6 Endpoint\r\nBehaviors required for mobility use cases.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":["SRv6 mobility","MUP","CMUP","srv6 3gpp","GTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9433","errata_url":null}
