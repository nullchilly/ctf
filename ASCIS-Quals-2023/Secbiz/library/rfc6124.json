This\r\ndocument defines an authentication mechanism for EAP called EAP-EKE,\r\nbased on the Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) protocol.  This method\r\nprovides mutual authentication through the use of a short, easy to\r\nremember password.  Compared with other common authentication\r\nmethods, EAP-EKE is not susceptible to dictionary attacks.  Neither\r\ndoes it require the availability of public-key certificates.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["password-based authentication","mutual authentication","password-based cryptography","password authenticated key exchange","weak password authentication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6124","errata_url":null}
