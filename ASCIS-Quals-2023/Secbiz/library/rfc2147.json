{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC2147","title":" TCP and UDP over IPv6 Jumbograms ","authors":["D. Borman"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"3","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IP Next Generation","abstract":" IPv6 supports datagrams larger than 65535 bytes long, often referred to as jumbograms, through use of the Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option.  The UDP protocol has a 16-bit length field that keeps it from being able to make use of jumbograms, and though TCP does not have a length field, both the MSS option and the Urgent field are constrained by 16-bits. This document describes some simple changes that can be made to allow TCP and UDP to make use of IPv6 jumbograms.
