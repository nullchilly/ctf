This document generalizes and expands this\r\nmethodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets can\r\nfollow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a\r\nmultipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason, the technique\r\nhere described is called \"Multipoint Alternate Marking\".","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["Clustered Alternate Marking","Multipoint Marking Method","Multipoint Coloring Technique","Network Clustering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9342"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8889","errata_url":null}
