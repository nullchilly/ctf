The\r\npurpose of these alternate and additional mechanisms is to provide\r\noperator control and experience that more closely models the behavior\r\nof linear protection seen in other transport networks.\r\n\r\nThis document also introduces capabilities and modes for linear\r\nprotection.  A capability is an individual behavior, and a mode is a\r\nparticular combination of capabilities.  Two modes are defined in\r\nthis document: Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and Automatic\r\nProtection Switching (APS) mode.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the behavior of the PSC protocol including\r\npriority logic and state machine when all the capabilities associated\r\nwith the APS mode are enabled.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 6378 in that the capability advertisement\r\nmethod defined here is an addition to that document.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["PSC mode","APS mode","capabilities","priority","non-revertive","MS-W support","SD support","EXER support"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6378"],"updated_by":["RFC8234"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7271","errata_url":null}
