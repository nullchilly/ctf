It first defines an architectural \r\nmodel for an RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC), which can \r\nimplement DDP or RDMAP and DDP.  The document reviews various \r\nattacks against the resources defined in the architectural model \r\nand the countermeasures that can be used to protect the system.\r\nAttacks are grouped into those that can be mitigated by using secure\r\ncommunication channels across the network, attacks from Remote Peers,\r\nand attacks from Local Peers.  Attack categories include spoofing,\r\ntampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.
