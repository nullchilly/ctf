The IASA was revised under a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure by the\r\nIASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal,\r\nand financial structure. As a result, it also changed the\r\nrelationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to\r\nrevise RFC 2031.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["IASA"],"obsoletes":["RFC2031"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8712","errata_url":null}
