Because dialogs are\r\nbetween pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party\r\ncommunications (such as a phone call), is obvious.  Communications\r\nsessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing,\r\nare more complicated.  This document defines a framework for how such\r\nconferencing can occur.  This framework describes the overall\r\narchitecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for\r\nmulti-party conferencing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2006","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4353","errata_url":null}
