It is opaque to bundle processing.\r\nTherefore, it has no impact on the interoperability of different\r\nBundle Protocol implementations, but instead affects only the\r\ninteroperability of different convergence-layer adaptation\r\nimplementations.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research\r\nGroup and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its\r\npublication as an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["DTN","delay-tolerant networking","BP","bundle protocol","IPN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6260","errata_url":null}
