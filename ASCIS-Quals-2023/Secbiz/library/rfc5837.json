The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to\r\nidentify any combination of the following: the IP interface upon\r\nwhich a datagram arrived, the sub-IP component of an IP interface\r\nupon which a datagram arrived, the IP interface through which the\r\ndatagram would have been forwarded had it been forwardable, and the\r\nIP next hop to which the datagram would have been forwarded.\r\n\r\nDevices can use this ICMP extension to identify interfaces and their\r\ncomponents by any combination of the following: ifIndex, IPv4\r\naddress, IPv6 address, name, and MTU.  ICMP-aware devices can use\r\nthese extensions to identify both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"April 2010","keywords":["[--------]","Internet Control Message Protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5837","errata_url":null}
