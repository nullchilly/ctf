Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure.
