Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is\r\nachieved via two methods -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF\r\nrouter has just been connected to the network and asynchronous\r\nflooding that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence\r\nof topology changes after the initial procedure was completed.  It may\r\nsometime be necessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs.\r\nThe OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers to do so without\r\nactually changing the topology view of the network.\r\n\r\nThis memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism to perform such a form\r\nof out-of-band LSDB synchronization.  The mechanism described in this\r\ndocument was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in\r\nRFC 3623, came into existence.  It is implemented\/supported by at\r\nleast one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field.  The\r\npurpose of this document is to capture the details of this mechanism\r\nfor public use.  This mechanism is not an IETF standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2007","keywords":["open shortest path first"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9454"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4811","errata_url":null}
