Changing addresses over time limits the\r\nwindow of time during which eavesdroppers and other information\r\ncollectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity\r\ncorrelation when the same address is employed for multiple\r\ntransactions by the same host. Additionally, it reduces the window of\r\nexposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes\r\nrevealed as a result of active communication.
