Murphy"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"33","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Open Shortest Path First IGP","abstract":" This memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) area that is somewhat humorously referred to as a \"not-so-stubby\" area (or NSSA).  NSSAs are similar to the existing OSPF stub area configuration option but have the additional capability of importing AS external routes in a limited fashion. The OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587.  The functional differences between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in Appendix F. All differences, while expanding capability, are backward-compatible in nature.  Implementations of this memo and of RFC 1587 will interoperate.
