In RTP-based source-specific\r\nmulticast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used to designate the\r\naddress and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in the SDP\r\ndescription.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM session\r\nitself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity,\r\nand thus, is required to be derived from the \"m=\" line of the media\r\ndescription.  Deriving the RTCP port from the \"m=\" line imposes an\r\nunnecessary restriction.  This document removes this restriction by\r\nintroducing a new SDP attribute.
