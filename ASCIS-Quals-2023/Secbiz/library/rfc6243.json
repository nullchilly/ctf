In some cases, part\r\nof this data may not be set by the NETCONF client, but rather a\r\ndefault value known to the server is used instead.  In many\r\nsituations the NETCONF client has a priori knowledge about default\r\ndata, so the NETCONF server does not need to save it in a NETCONF\r\nconfiguration datastore or send it to the client in a retrieval\r\noperation reply.  In other situations the NETCONF client will need\r\nthis data from the server.  Not all server implementations treat this\r\ndefault data the same way.  This document defines a capability-based\r\nextension to the NETCONF protocol that allows the NETCONF client to\r\nidentify how defaults are processed by the server, and also defines\r\nnew mechanisms for client control of server processing of default\r\ndata.
