In GRE Tunnel\r\nBonding, two GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and\r\nbonded together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber.\r\nCompared with each subconnection, the bonded connections promise\r\nincreased access capacity and improved reliability.  The solution\r\ndescribed in this document is currently implemented by Huawei and\r\ndeployed by Deutsche Telekom AG.  This document will enable other\r\ndevelopers to build interoperable implementations.","pub_date":"May 2017","keywords":["Hybrid Access","Bandwidth Aggregation","Bonding Tunnel","GRE Channel","Hybrid Access Aggregation Point","Home Gateway"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8157","errata_url":null}
