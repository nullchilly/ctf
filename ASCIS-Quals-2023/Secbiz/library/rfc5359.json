This covers most features offered in so-called IP Centrex\r\nofferings from local exchange carriers and PBX (Private Branch\r\nExchange) features.  Most of the services shown in this document are\r\nimplemented in the SIP user agents, although some require the\r\nassistance of a SIP proxy.  Some require some extensions to SIP\r\nincluding the REFER, SUBSCRIBE, and NOTIFY methods and the Replaces\r\nand Join header fields.  These features are not intended to be an\r\nexhaustive set, but rather show implementations of common features\r\nlikely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones in a business\r\nenvironment.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices \r\nfor the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":["[--------|b]","sip","pbx","centrex","features","hold","transfer","forwarding","screening","park","pickup","redial","click","call flows"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0144"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5359","errata_url":null}
