It is desirable to seamlessly combine the\r\nconnectivity over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to\r\nimprove the quality of experience for applications that do not have\r\nbuilt-in multi-path capabilities. Such optimization requires\r\nadditional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each\r\npacket. This document presents a new lightweight and flexible\r\nencapsulation protocol for this need. The solution has been developed\r\nby the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards\r\nbodies including the IETF and 3GPP. However, this document is not an\r\nInternet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the\r\nIETF. This document will enable other developers to build\r\ninteroperable implementations in order to experiment with the\r\nprotocol.","pub_date":"February 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9188","errata_url":null}
