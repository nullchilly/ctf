More specifically, one needs to validate\r\nthat the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix (as\r\nderived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact\r\nauthorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a\r\nsimple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":["[--------]","SIDR","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8481","RFC8893"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6811","errata_url":null}
