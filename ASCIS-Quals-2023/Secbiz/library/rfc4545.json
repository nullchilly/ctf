In\r\nparticular, it defines objects for managing user identities and the\r\nnames, addresses, and credentials required manage access control, for use\r\nwith various protocols.  This document was motivated by the need for the\r\nconfiguration of authorized user identities for the iSCSI protocol,\r\nbut has been extended to be useful for other protocols that have\r\nsimilar requirements.  It is important to note that this MIB module\r\nprovides only the set of identities to be used within access lists; it is\r\nthe responsibility of other MIB modules making use of this one to tie\r\nthem to their own access lists or other authorization control methods.
