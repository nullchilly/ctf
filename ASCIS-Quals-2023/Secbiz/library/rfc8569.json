It specifies the set\r\nof mandatory and optional fields within those messages and describes\r\ntheir behavior and interpretation.  This architecture and protocol\r\nspecification is independent of a specific wire encoding.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also uses a control message called an Interest Return,\r\nwhereby one system can return an Interest message to the previous hop\r\ndue to an error condition.  This indicates to the previous hop that\r\nthe current system will not respond to the Interest.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Information-Centric Networking\r\nResearch Group (ICNRG).  The document received wide review among\r\nICNRG participants.  Two full implementations are in active use and\r\nhave informed the technical maturity of the protocol specification.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":["Content Centric Networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8569","errata_url":null}
