This document\r\nspecifies how the TinyIPFIX Data and Template Records are transmitted\r\nin constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN and how TinyIPFIX data can be\r\nconverted into data that is not TinyIPFIX in a proxy device.","pub_date":"November 2017","keywords":["TinyIPFIX","Smart Meters","Constrained Networks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8272","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8272"}
