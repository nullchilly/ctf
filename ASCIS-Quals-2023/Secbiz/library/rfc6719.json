This specification\r\ndescribes the Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function\r\n(MRHOF), an Objective Function that selects routes that minimize a\r\nmetric, while using hysteresis to reduce churn in response to small\r\nmetric changes.  MRHOF works with additive metrics along a route, and\r\nthe metrics it uses are determined by the metrics that the RPL\r\nDestination Information Object (DIO) messages advertise.
