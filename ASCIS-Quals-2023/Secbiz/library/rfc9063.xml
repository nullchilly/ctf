      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This memo describes the Host Identity (HI) namespace, which 
      provides a cryptographic namespace to applications, and the
      associated protocol layer, the Host Identity Protocol, located
      between the internetworking and transport layers, that supports
      end-host mobility, multihoming, and NAT traversal. Herein are
      presented the basics of the current namespaces, their strengths
      and weaknesses, and how a HI namespace will add completeness to
      them. The roles of the HI namespace in the protocols are
      defined. </t>

        This document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by
        the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility. The Security Considerations section
	also describes measures against flooding attacks, usage of identities in access control lists,
	weaker types of identifiers, and trust on first use.
	This document incorporates
        lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 7401 and goes further
        to explain how HIP works as a secure signaling channel.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Internet has two important global namespaces: Internet
      Protocol (IP) addresses and Domain Name Service (DNS) names.
      These two namespaces have a set of features and abstractions
      that have powered the Internet to what it is today.  They also
      have a number of weaknesses.  Basically, since they are all we
      have, we try to do too much with them.  Semantic overloading
      and functionality extensions have greatly complicated these
      namespaces.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The proposed Host Identity namespace is also a global namespace, and it fills an important gap between
      the IP and DNS namespaces.  A Host Identity conceptually refers
      to a computing platform, and there may be multiple such Host 
      Identities per computing platform (because the platform may wish
      to present a different identity to different communicating peers).
      The Host Identity namespace consists of Host Identifiers (HI).  
      There is exactly one Host Identifier for each Host Identity
      (although there may be transient periods of time such as key
      replacement when more than one identifier may be active).
      While this text later talks about non-cryptographic Host Identifiers,
      the architecture focuses on the case in which Host Identifiers are
      cryptographic in nature.  Specifically, the Host Identifier is the
      public key of an asymmetric key pair.  Each Host Identity uniquely 
      identifies a single host, i.e., no two hosts have the same Host 
      Identity.  If two or more computing platforms have the same Host
      Identifier, then they are instantiating a distributed host.  The Host 
      Identifier can either be public (e.g., published in the DNS) or 
      unpublished.  Client systems will tend to have both public and 
      unpublished Host Identifiers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">There is a subtle but important difference between Host
      Identities and Host Identifiers.  An Identity refers to the
      abstract entity that is identified.  An Identifier, on the other
      hand, refers to the concrete bit pattern that is used in the
      identification process.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">Although the Host Identifiers could be used in many
      authentication systems, such as <xref target="RFC7296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7296">IKEv2</xref>, the presented
      architecture introduces a new protocol, called the Host Identity
      Protocol (HIP), and a cryptographic exchange, called the HIP
      base exchange; see also <xref target="control-plane" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>.  
      HIP provides for limited forms of
      trust between systems, enhances mobility, multihoming, and
      dynamic IP renumbering, aids in protocol translation and transition,
      and reduces certain types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">When HIP is used, the actual payload traffic between two HIP
      hosts is typically, but not necessarily, protected with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
      <xref target="RFC7402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7402"/>.
      The Host Identities are used to create the needed ESP Security
      Associations (SAs) and to authenticate the hosts.  When ESP is
      used, the actual payload IP packets do not differ in any way
      from standard ESP-protected IP packets.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">
      Much has been learned about HIP <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/> since <xref target="RFC4423" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4423"/>
      was published. This document expands Host Identities beyond their original use
      to enable IP connectivity and security to enable general interhost secure
      signaling at any protocol layer.  The signal may establish a security
      association between the hosts or simply pass information within
      the channel.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">The Internet is built from three principal components:
      computing platforms (endpoints), packet transport
      (i.e., internetworking) infrastructure, and services
      (applications).  The Internet exists to service two principal
      components: people and robotic services (silicon-based people,
      if you will).  All these components need to be named in order to
      interact in a scalable manner.  Here we concentrate on naming
      computing platforms and packet transport elements.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">There are two principal namespaces in use in the Internet for
      these components: IP addresses, and Domain Names.  
      Domain Names provide hierarchically assigned names for some
      computing platforms and some services.  Each hierarchy is
      delegated from the level above; there is no anonymity in Domain
      Names.  Email, HTTP, and SIP addresses all reference Domain
      Names.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">The IP addressing namespace has been overloaded to name both 
      interfaces (at Layer 3) and endpoints (for the endpoint-specific
      part of Layer 3 and for Layer 4).  In their role as interface
      names, IP addresses are sometimes called "locators" and serve
      as an endpoint within a routing topology.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">IP addresses are numbers that name networking interfaces, and typically only
      when the interface is connected to the network.  Originally, IP
      addresses had long-term significance.  Today, the vast number of
      interfaces use ephemeral and/or non-unique IP addresses.  That is,
      every time an interface is connected to the network, it is
      assigned an IP address.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-5">In the current Internet, the transport layers are coupled to
      the IP addresses.  Neither can evolve separately from the other.
      IPng deliberations were strongly shaped by the decision that a
      corresponding TCPng would not be created.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-6">There are three critical deficiencies with the current
      namespaces.  First, the establishing of initial contact and the sustaining of data flows
      between two hosts can be challenging due to private address realms and the ephemeral nature of addresses.
      Second, confidentiality is not provided in a consistent,
      trustable manner.  Finally, authentication for systems and
      datagrams is not provided.  All of these deficiencies arise
      because computing platforms are not well named with the current
      namespaces. </t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-1">An independent namespace for computing platforms could be
        used in end-to-end operations independent of the evolution of
        the internetworking layer and across the many internetworking
        layers.  This could support rapid readdressing of the
        internetworking layer because of mobility, rehoming, or
        renumbering.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-2">If the namespace for computing platforms is based on
	public-key cryptography, it can also provide authentication
        services.  If this namespace is locally created without

        The first is a decoupling of the internetworking and transport
        layers; see <xref target="sec-architecture" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>.  This
        decoupling will allow for independent evolution of the two
        layers.  Additionally, it can provide end-to-end services over
        multiple internetworking realms.  The second feature is host
        authentication.  Because the Host Identifier is a public key,
        this key can be used for authentication in security protocols
        like ESP.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">An identity is based on public-private key cryptography in HIP.
        The Host Identity is referred to by its public component, the public
        key.  Thus, the name representing a Host Identity in the Host
        Identity namespace, i.e., the Host Identifier, is the public
        key.  In a way, the possession of the private key defines the
        Identity itself.  If the private key is possessed by more than
        one node, the Identity can be considered to be a distributed
        one.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-3">Architecturally, any other Internet naming convention might
	form a usable base for Host Identifiers.  However,
	non-cryptographic names should only be used in situations of
	high trust and/or low risk.  That is any place where host
	authentication is not needed (no risk of host spoofing) and no
	use of ESP.  However, at least for interconnected networks
	spanning several operational domains, the set of environments
	where the risk of host spoofing allowed by non-cryptographic
	Host Identifiers is acceptable is the null set.  Hence, the
	current HIP documents do not specify how to use any other
	types of Host Identifiers but public keys. For instance,
	the Back to My Mac service <xref target="RFC6281" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6281"/> from Apple comes

	is known as a preimage attack, and the resistance to finding a second
	Host Identifier (public key) that hashes to the same HIT is called
	second preimage resistance.  Second preimage resistance in HIP is
	based on the hash algorithm strength and the length of the hash
	output used.  Through HIPv2 <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/>, this resistance is 96 bits

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-1">An LSI is a 32-bit localized representation for a Host
	Identity.
        Due to its size, it is suitable for use in the existing sockets API in
	the place of IPv4 addresses (e.g., in sockaddr_in structure, sin_addr member) without modifying applications.
        The purpose of an LSI is to facilitate using Host
	Identities in existing APIs for IPv4-based
	applications.
        LSIs are never transmitted on the wire; when an application
        sends data using a pair of LSIs, the HIP layer (or sockets
        handler) translates the LSIs to the corresponding HITs, and
        vice versa for the receiving of data.
        Besides facilitating HIP-based connectivity for
	legacy IPv4 applications, the LSIs are beneficial in two other
	scenarios <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-2">In the first scenario, two IPv4-only applications
        reside on two separate hosts connected by IPv6-only
        network. With HIP-based connectivity, the two applications are
        able to communicate despite the mismatch in the protocol
        families of the applications and the underlying network. The
        reason is that the HIP layer translates the LSIs originating
        from the upper layers into routable IPv6 locators before
        delivering the packets on the wire.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-3">The second scenario is the same as the first one, but with
        the difference that one of the applications supports only
        IPv6. Now two obstacles hinder the communication between the
        applications: the addressing families of the two applications
        differ, and the application residing at the IPv4-only side is
        again unable to communicate because of the mismatch between
        addressing families of the application (IPv4) and network
        (IPv6). With HIP-based connectivity for applications, this
        scenario works; the HIP layer can choose whether to translate
        the locator of an incoming packet into an LSI or HIT.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-4">Effectively, LSIs improve IPv6 interoperability at the
        network layer as described in the first scenario and at the
        application layer as depicted in the second example. The
        interoperability mechanism should not be used to avoid
        transition to IPv6; the authors firmly believe in IPv6
        adoption and encourage developers to port existing IPv4-only
        applications to use IPv6. However, some proprietary,
        closed-source, IPv4-only applications may never see the
        daylight of IPv6, and the LSI mechanism is suitable for
        extending the lifetime of such applications even in IPv6-only
        networks.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-5">The main disadvantage of an LSI is its local
        scope. Applications may violate layering principles and pass
        LSIs to each other in application-layer protocols. As the LSIs
        are valid only in the context of the local host, they may
        represent an entirely different host when passed to another
        host. However, it should be emphasized here that the LSI
        concept is effectively a host-based NAT and does not introduce
        any more issues than the prevalent middlebox-based NATs for
        IPv4. In other words, the applications violating layering
        principles are already broken by the NAT boxes that are
        ubiquitously deployed.</t>

      securely obtained by some other means, the Initiator can use this to
      authenticate the signed HIP packets.  Likewise, if the
      Initiator's HI is in a secure DNS zone, the Responder can
      retrieve it and validate the signed HIP packets.  However, since
      an Initiator may choose to use an unpublished HI, it knowingly
      risks a MitM attack.  The Responder may choose not to accept a
      HIP exchange with an Initiator using an unknown HI.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-11.1-4">Other types of MitM attacks against HIP can be mounted using
      ICMP messages that can be used to signal about problems. As an
      overall guideline, the ICMP messages should be considered as
      unreliable "hints" and should be acted upon only after
      timeouts. The exact attack scenarios and countermeasures are
      described in full detail in the <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401">base
      exchange specification</xref>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-11.1-5">A MitM attacker could try to replay older I1 or R1 messages using weaker cryptographic algorithms as described in <xref target="RFC7401" section="4.1.4" sectionFormat="of" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7401#section-4.1.4" derivedContent="RFC7401"/>.
      The base exchange has been augmented to deal with 
      such an attack by restarting on the detection of the attack.  At 
      worst, this would only lead to a situation in which the 
      base exchange would never finish (or would be aborted after 
      some retries).  As a drawback, this leads to a six-way base 
      exchange, which may seem bad at first.  However, since this 
      only occurs in an attack scenario and since the attack can 
      be handled (so it is not interesting to mount anymore), we
      assume the subsequent messages do not represent a security threat. Since 
      the MitM cannot be successful with a downgrade attack, these 
      sorts of attacks will only occur as 'nuisance' attacks. So, 
      the base exchange would still be usually just four packets 
      even though implementations must be prepared to protect 
      themselves against the downgrade attack.</t>

      SPI; the source address is always ignored, and the destination

      ESP is IP address independent.
      This might seem to make attacking easier, but ESP with
      replay protection is already as well protected as possible, and
      the removal of the IP address as a check should not increase the
      exposure of ESP to DoS attacks.</t>

      If the peer hosts were to simply accept the move, the result
      would be a packet flood to the target node's address.  To

        specifically, when ESP is used as the data plane protocol for HIP, the
        association between the control and data planes is weak and can
        be exploited under certain assumptions. In the
        scenario, the attacker has already gained access to the target
        network protected by a HIP-aware firewall, but wants to
        circumvent the HIP-based firewall. To achieve this, the
        attacker passively observes a base exchange between two HIP
        hosts and later replays it. This way, the attacker manages to
        penetrate the firewall and can use a fake ESP tunnel to
        transport its own data. This is possible because the firewall
        cannot distinguish when the ESP tunnel is valid. As a
        solution, HIP-aware middleboxes may participate in the control
        plane interaction by adding random nonce parameters to the
        control traffic, which the end-hosts have to sign to
        guarantee the freshness of the control traffic <xref target="I-D.heer-hip-middle-auth" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="heer-midauth"/>. As an alternative, extensions for

      application layer that allowed a dynamically linked library to intercept socket-related calls
      without rebuilding the related application
      binaries. The library acted as a shim layer between
      the application and transport layers. The shim layer translated
      the non-HIP-based socket calls from the application into
      HIP-based socket calls. While the shim library involved some
      level of complexity as described in more detail in <xref target="komu-leap" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="komu-leap"/>, it achieved the goal of applying

	The second TOFU principle essentially states that communication
	should prioritized over security. So

	authentication is present, and even possibly a fallback to
	unencrypted communications could be allowed (if policy permits) instead of blocking communications.
	In practice, this can be realized in three
	steps. In the first step, a HIP Initiator can look up the HI of a
	Responder from a directory such as DNS. When the Initiator discovers a HI,
	it can use the HI for authentication and skip the rest of the
	following steps. In the second step, the Initiator can, upon failing to find a HI, try opportunistic mode
	with the Responder. In the third step, the

	failing with opportunistic mode if

	back to opportunistic mode when no out-of-band credentials are
	available. As the last resort, fallback to non-HIP-based
	communications can be used if the policy allows it. Also,
	since perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is explicitly mentioned
	in the third design principle, it is worth mentioning that

	The fourth TOFU principle states that users and noninteractive

	However, the users failed to
	notice the difference between opportunistic, non-authenticated HIP and
	non-opportunistic, authenticated HIP. The reason for this was that the
	opportunistic HIP (i.e., lowered level of security)
	was not clearly indicated in the prompt. This provided a

        <t indent="0" pn="section-11.5-11">Detection of peer capabilities is also mentioned in the TOFU
      context. As discussed in this section, the three-step model can
      be used to detect peer capabilities. A host can achieve the
      first step of authentication, i.e., discovery of a public key,
      via DNS, for instance. If the host finds no keys, the host can then try
      opportunistic mode as the second step. Upon a timeout, the host
      can then proceed to the third step by falling back to non-HIP-based
      communications if the policy permits. This last step is based on
      an implicit timeout rather an explicit (negative) acknowledgment
      like in the case of DNS, so the user may conclude prematurely
      that the connectivity has failed. To speed up the detection
      phase by explicitly detecting if the peer supports opportunistic
      HIP, researchers have proposed TCP-specific extensions
      <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/> <xref target="komu-leap" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="komu-leap"/>. In a
      nutshell, an Initiator sends simultaneously both an opportunistic I1 packet and
      the related TCP SYN datagram equipped with a special TCP option
      to a peer. If the peer supports HIP, it drops the
      SYN packet and responds with an R1. If the peer is HIP
      incapable, it drops the HIP packet (and the unknown TCP option)
      and responds with a TCP SYN-ACK. The benefit of the proposed
      scheme is a faster, one round-trip fallback to non-HIP-based
      communications. The drawback is that the approach is tied to TCP
      (IP options were also considered, but do not work well with firewalls
      and NATs). Naturally, the approach does not work against an active
      attacker, but opportunistic mode is not supposed to protect
      against such an adversary anyway.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-11.5-12">It is worth noting that while the use of opportunistic mode has some benefits related
      to incremental deployment, it does not achieve all the benefits

      authenticated HIP supports persistent identifiers in the sense
      that hosts are identified with the same HI independent of

      partially: after the first contact between two hosts, HIP can
      successfully sustain connectivity with its mobility management extensions,
      but problems emerge when the hosts close the HIP association and try to reestablish connectivity. As hosts
      can change their location, it is no longer guaranteed that the same IP
      address belongs to the same host. The same address
      can be temporally assigned to different hosts, e.g., due to the
      reuse of IP addresses (e.g., by a DHCP service), the overlapping of
      private address realms (see also the discussion on Internet
      transparency in <xref target="sec_benefits" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.1"/>), or due to an

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) format that obsoletes that in RFC 4843. These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application-layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6-layer perspective, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.</t>
              <t indent="0">The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally defined in RFC 4843 lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document removes this limitation by encoding, in the identifier itself, an index to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.</t>

              <t indent="0">   The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) and architecture adds a
   cryptographic name space to name Internet hosts.  This draft
   describes a use case of the HIP architecture, which is to provide a
   HIP-enabled virtual private LAN service (VPLS) over an untrusted
   network.  In this case, HIP is used to secure tunnels between the
   provider edge (PE) equipment.

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.  Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2284.

Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses for which the interface identifier is generated by computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and auxiliary parameters.  The binding between the public key and the address can be verified by re-computing the hash value and by comparing the hash with the interface identifier.  Messages sent from an IPv6 address can be protected by attaching the public key and auxiliary parameters and by signing the message with the corresponding private key.  The protection works without a certification authority or any security infrastructure.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service.  Running the service requires the help of "Teredo servers" and "Teredo relays".  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the "native" IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as "6to4".  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document is an informative overview of how legacy applications can be made to work with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP proposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names. From an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address family of host identifiers, but it may be a long time until such HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are upgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation and Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not, and is intended to aid implementors and early adopters in thinking about and locally solving systems issues regarding the incremental deployment of HIP.  This memo provides information  for the Internet community.</t>

In particular, it attempts to document the properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, especially properties that were (and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived to exist as well as properties that would cause problems if changed.  The discussion of these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.

With the extensions, the application can also support more relaxed security models where communication can be non-HIP-based, according to local policies.  The extensions in this document are experimental and provide basic tools for further experimentation with policies.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

   Protocol (HIP), for active RFIDs, i.e. Radio Frequency Identifiers
   including tamper resistant computing resources, as specified for
   example in the ISO 14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-RFIDs never expose
   their identity in clear text, but hide this value (typically an EPC-

   entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges occur between HIP-RFIDs
   and portals; they are transported by IP packets, through the Internet

              <t indent="0">   This document mainly analyzes the key revocation issue with host
   identifiers (HIs) in the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  Generally,
   key revocation is an important functionality of key management
   systems; it is concerned with the issues of removing cryptographic
   keys from operational use when they are not secure or not secure
   enough any more.  This functionality is particularly important for
   the security systems expected to execute for long periods.  This
   document also attempts to investigate several issues that a designer
   of HI revocation mechanisms need to carefully consider.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-1">In the beginning, the network layer protocol (i.e., IP) had
      the following four "classic" invariants:

        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-appendix.a.1-2">
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-2.1" derivedCounter="1.">Non-mutable: The address sent is the address
	  received.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-2.2" derivedCounter="2.">Non-mobile: The address doesn't change during the course
          of an "association".</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-2.3" derivedCounter="3.">Reversible: A return header can always be formed by
          reversing the source and destination addresses.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-2.4" derivedCounter="4.">Omniscient: Each host knows what address a partner host
          can use to send packets to it.</li>
        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-3">Actually, the fourth can be inferred from 1 and 3, but it is
      worth mentioning explicitly for reasons that will be obvious soon if not
      already.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-4">In the current "post-classic" world, we are intentionally
      trying to get rid of the second invariant (both for mobility and
      for multihoming), and we have been forced to give up the first
      and the fourth.  <xref target="RFC3102" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3102">Realm Specific IP</xref>
      is an attempt to reinstate the fourth invariant without the
      first invariant.  IPv6 attempts to reinstate the first
      invariant.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-5">Few client-side systems on the Internet have DNS names that are
      meaningful. That is, if they have a Fully Qualified Domain Name
      (FQDN), that name typically belongs to a NAT device or a dial-up
      server, and does not really identify the system itself but its
      current connectivity. FQDNs (and their extensions as email
      names) are application-layer names; more frequently naming
      services than particular systems.  This is why many systems on
      the Internet are not registered in the DNS; they do not have
      services of interest to other Internet hosts.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-6">DNS names are references to IP addresses.  This only
      demonstrates the interrelationship of the networking and
      application layers.  DNS, as the Internet's only deployed and
      distributed database, is also the repository of other namespaces,
      due in part to DNSSEC and application-specific key records.
      Although each namespace can be stretched (IP with v6, DNS with
      KEY records), neither can adequately provide for host
      authentication or act as a separation between internetworking
      and transport layers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-7">The Host Identity (HI) namespace fills an important gap
      between the IP and DNS namespaces. An interesting thing about
      the HI is that it actually allows a host to give up all but the
      3rd network-layer invariant. That is to say, as long as the
      source and destination addresses in the network-layer protocol
      are reversible, HIP takes care of host identification, and
      reversibility allows a local host to receive a packet back from
      a remote host. The address changes occurring during NAT transit
      (non-mutable) or host movement (non-omniscient or non-mobile)
      can be managed by the HIP layer.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-8">With the exception of high-performance computing applications,
      the sockets API is the most common way to develop network
      applications.  Applications use the sockets API either directly
      or indirectly through some libraries or frameworks. However, the
      sockets API is based on the assumption of static IP addresses,
      and DNS with its lifetime values was invented at later stages
      during the evolution of the Internet. Hence, the sockets API
      does not deal with the lifetime of addresses <xref target="RFC6250" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6250"/>. As the majority of the end-user equipment is
      mobile today, their addresses are effectively ephemeral, but the
      sockets API still gives a fallacious illusion of persistent IP
      addresses to the unwary developer. HIP can be used to solidify
      this illusion because HIP provides persistent, surrogate
      addresses to the application layer in the form of LSIs and
      HITs.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-9">The persistent identifiers as provided by HIP are useful in
      multiple scenarios (see, e.g., <xref target="ylitalo-diss" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ylitalo-diss"/> or
      <xref target="komu-diss" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="komu-diss"/> for a more elaborate
      discussion):</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-appendix.a.1-10">
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.1">When a mobile host moves physically between two different
          WLAN networks and obtains a new address, an application using
          the identifiers remains isolated regardless of the topology changes
          while the underlying HIP layer reestablishes connectivity
          (i.e., a horizontal handoff).</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.2">Similarly, the application utilizing the identifiers
          remains again unaware of the topological changes when the
          underlying host equipped with WLAN and cellular network
          interfaces switches between the two different access
          technologies (i.e., a vertical handoff).</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.3">Even when hosts are located in private address realms,
          applications can uniquely distinguish different hosts from
          each other based on their identifiers. In other words, it can
          be stated that HIP improves Internet transparency
          for the application layer <xref target="komu-diss" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="komu-diss"/>.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.4">Site renumbering events for services can occur due to
          corporate mergers or acquisitions, or by changes in Internet
          service provider. They can involve changing the entire
          network prefix of an organization, which is problematic due
          to hard-coded addresses in service configuration files or
          cached IP addresses at the client side <xref target="RFC5887" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5887"/>. Considering such human errors, a site employing
          location-independent identifiers as promoted by HIP may
          experience fewer problems while renumbering their network.
          </li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.5">More agile IPv6 interoperability can be achieved,
          as discussed in <xref target="lsi" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.4"/>. IPv6-based applications can
          communicate using HITs with IPv4-based applications that are
          using LSIs. Additionally, the underlying network type (IPv4 or IPv6)
          becomes independent of the addressing family of the
          application.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.1-10.6">HITs (or LSIs) can be used in IP-based access control
          lists as a more secure replacement for IPv6
          addresses. Besides security, HIT-based access control has two
          other benefits. First, the use of HITs can potentially halve the size of access control lists
          because separate rules for IPv4 are not
          needed <xref target="komu-diss" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="komu-diss"/>. Second, HIT-based configuration
          rules in HIP-aware middleboxes remain static and independent
          of topology changes, thus simplifying administrative efforts
          particularly for mobile environments. For instance, the
          benefits of HIT-based access control have been harnessed in the
          case of HIP-aware firewalls, but can be utilized
          directly at the end-hosts as well <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-11">While some of these benefits could be and have been
      redundantly implemented by individual applications, providing
      such generic functionality at the lower layers is useful because
      it reduces software development effort and networking software
      bugs (as the layer is tested with multiple applications). It
      also allows the developer to focus on building the application
      itself rather than delving into the intricacies of mobile
      networking, thus facilitating separation of concerns.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-12">HIP could also be realized by combining a number of different
      protocols, but the complexity of the resulting software may
      become substantially larger, and the interaction between multiple,
      possibly layered protocols may have adverse effects on latency
      and throughput. It is also worth noting that virtually nothing
      prevents realizing the HIP architecture, for instance, as an
      application-layer library, which has been actually implemented
      in the past <xref target="xin-hip-lib" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="xin-hip-lib"/>. However, the trade-off
      in moving the HIP layer to the application layer is that legacy
      applications may not be supported.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-1">In computer science, many problems can be solved with an
      extra layer of indirection. However, the indirection always
      involves some costs as there is no such a thing as a "free lunch". In
      the case of HIP, the main costs could be stated as follows:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-appendix.a.2-2">
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.2-2.1">In general, an additional layer and a namespace always involve
          some initial effort in terms of implementation,
          deployment, and maintenance. Some education of developers and administrators may
          also be needed. However, the HIP community at the IETF has
          spent years in experimenting, exploring, testing,
          documenting, and implementing HIP to ease the adoption costs.
          </li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.2-2.2">HIP introduces a need to manage HIs and
	  requires a centralized approach to manage HIP-aware
	  endpoints at scale. What were formerly IP address-based ACLs
	  are now trusted HITs, and the HIT-to-IP address mappings as
	  well as access policies must be managed. HIP-aware endpoints
	  must also be able to operate autonomously to ensure mobility
	  and availability (an endpoint must be able to run without
	  having to have a persistent management connection).  The
	  users who want this better security and mobility of HIs
	  instead of IP address-based ACLs have to then manage this
	  additional 'identity layer' in a nonpersistent fashion. As
	  exemplified in <xref target="tempered" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.3.5"/>, these challenges
	  have been already solved in an infrastructure setting to
	  distribute policy and manage the mappings and trust
	  relationships between HIP-aware endpoints.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.a.2-2.3">HIP decouples identifier and locator roles of IP
          addresses. Consequently, a mapping mechanism is needed to
          associate them together. A failure to map a HIT to its
          corresponding locator may result in failed connectivity
          because a HIT is "flat" by its nature and cannot be looked
          up from the hierarchically organized DNS. HITs are flat by
          design due to a security trade-off. The more bits that are
          allocated for the hash in the HIT, the less likely there
          will be (malicious) collisions.</li>

      The same cost may also occur during HIP handoff

However, HIP has not been a "wild success" <xref target="RFC5218" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5218"/> in the Internet as argued by <contact fullname="Levä"/> et al. <xref target="levae-barriers" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="levae-barriers"/>. Here, we briefly highlight
       some of their findings based on interviews with 19 experts from
       the industry and academia.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3.1-2">From a marketing perspective, the demand for HIP has been low
      and substitute technologies have been favored. Another
      identified reason has been that some technical misconceptions
      related to the early stages of HIP specifications still
      persist. Two identified misconceptions are that HIP does not
      support NAT traversal and that HIP must be implemented in the OS
      kernel. Both of these claims are untrue; HIP does have NAT
      traversal extensions <xref target="RFC9028" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9028"/>, and kernel
      modifications can be avoided with modern operating systems by
      diverting packets for userspace processing.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3.1-3">The analysis by <contact fullname="Levä"/> et al. clarifies infrastructural requirements for
      HIP. In a minimal setup, a client and server machine have to
      run HIP software. However, to avoid manual configurations,
      usually DNS records for HIP are set up. For instance, the
      popular DNS server software Bind9 does not require any changes
      to accommodate DNS records for HIP because they can be supported
      in binary format in its configuration files <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/>. HIP
      rendezvous servers and firewalls are optional. No changes are
      required to network address points, NATs, edge routers, or core
      networks. HIP may require holes in legacy firewalls.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3.1-4">The analysis also clarifies the requirements for the host
      components that consist of three parts. First, a HIP control
      plane component is required, typically implemented as a
      userspace daemon. Second, a data plane component is needed. Most
      HIP implementations utilize the so-called Bound End-to-End Tunnel (BEET) mode of ESP that
      has been available since Linux kernel 2.6.27, but the BEET mode is also included
      as a userspace component in a few of the
      implementations. Third, HIP systems usually provide a DNS proxy
      for the local host that translates HIP DNS records to LSIs and
      HITs, and communicates the corresponding locators to the HIP
      userspace daemon. While the third component is not
      mandatory, it is very useful for avoiding manual
      configurations. The three components are further described in
      the <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538">HIP experiment report</xref>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3.1-5">Based on the interviews, <contact fullname="Levä"/> et al. suggest further
      directions to facilitate HIP deployment.
      Transitioning a number of HIP specifications to the Standards Track in the
      IETF has already taken place, but the authors suggest other additional measures
      based on the interviews.
      As a more radical measure, the authors
      suggest to implement HIP as a purely application-layer library
      <xref target="xin-hip-lib" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="xin-hip-lib"/> or other kind of middleware. On
      the other hand, more conservative measures include focusing on
      private deployments controlled by a single stakeholder. As a
      more concrete example of such a scenario, HIP could be used by a
      single service provider to facilitate secure connectivity between its

      host (web browser) and a forward proxy (Apache server) that terminated the HIP/ESP tunnel. The
      forward web proxy translated HIP-based traffic originating from the
      client into non-HIP traffic towards any web server in the Internet. Consequently, the HIP-capable
      client could communicate with HIP-incapable web servers. This
      way, the client could utilize mobility support as provided by HIP
      while using the fixed IP address of the web proxy, for instance, to access services
      that were allowed only from the IP address range of the proxy.</t>

      via an intermediary load balancer (a web-based load
      balancer implementation called HAProxy). The load
      balancer translated non-HIP traffic originating from the
      client into HIP-based traffic for the web service (consisting
      of front-end and back-end servers). Both the load balancer and
      the web service were located in a data center. One of the
      key benefits for encrypting the web traffic with HIP in this
      scenario was supporting a private-public cloud scenario
      (i.e., hybrid cloud) where the load balancer, front-end servers,
      and back-end servers were located in different data centers,
      and thus the traffic needed to be protected when it passed through
      potentially insecure networks between the borders of the private and public clouds.

The key idea in the research work was to
      avoid redundant, time-consuming ICE procedures by grouping
      different connections (i.e., SIP and media streams) together
      using the low-layer HIP, which executes NAT traversal procedures
      only once per host. An interesting aspect in the approach was
      the use of P2P-SIP infrastructure as rendezvous servers for the HIP

            <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.4-2.1.2">HIP decouples the internetworking layer from the
		transport layer, allowing each to evolve separately.
		The decoupling makes end-host mobility and
		multihoming easier, also across IPv4 and IPv6
		networks.  HIs make network renumbering easier, and
		they also make process migration and clustered servers
		easier to implement.  Furthermore, being cryptographic
		in nature, they provide the basis for solving the
		security problems related to end-host mobility and
		multihoming.</t>

            <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.4-2.3.2">HIP provides both stable and temporary Host
		Identifiers.  Stable HIs are typically long-lived,
		with a lifetime of years or more.  The lifetime of
		temporary HIs depends on how long the upper-layer
		connections and applications need them, and can range

		indirectly (in the form of HITs or LSIs) by
		applications when they access network services.
		Additionally, the Host Identifiers, as public keys,
		are used in the built-in key agreement protocol,
		called the HIP base exchange, to authenticate the

            <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.4-2.9.2">For most purposes, an approach where DNS names are
		resolved simultaneously to HIs and IP addresses is

		flat resolution infrastructure is needed.  Such an
		infrastructure could be based on the ideas of
		Distributed Hash Tables, but would require significant
		new development and deployment.</t>
