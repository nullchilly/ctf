Shafer"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"30","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Network Modeling","abstract":"The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) gives access to native\r\ncapabilities of the devices within a network, defining methods for\r\nmanipulating configuration databases, retrieving operational data,\r\nand invoking specific operations.  YANG provides the means to define\r\nthe content carried via NETCONF, both data and operations.  Using\r\nboth technologies, standard modules can be defined to give\r\ninteroperability and commonality to devices, while still allowing\r\ndevices to express their unique capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network\r\nmanagement applications that meet the needs of network operators.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["[--------]","network configuration protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6244","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6244"}
