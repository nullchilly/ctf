The methods described in RFC 2544\r\nare intended to generate traffic that overloads network device\r\nresources in order to assess their capacity.  Overload of shared\r\nresources would likely be harmful to user traffic performance on a\r\nproduction network, and there are further negative consequences\r\nidentified with production application of the methods.  This memo\r\nclarifies the scope of RFC 2544 and other IETF BMWG benchmarking work\r\nfor isolated test environments only, and it encourages new standards\r\nactivity for measurement methods applicable outside that scope.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2012","keywords":["testing","performance"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2544"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6815","errata_url":null}
