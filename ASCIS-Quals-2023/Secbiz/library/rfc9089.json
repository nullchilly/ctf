An ingress\r\nLabel Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into\r\na given Label Switched Path (LSP) unless an egress LSR has indicated\r\nvia signaling that it has the capability to process ELs, referred to\r\nas the Entropy Label Capability (ELC), on that LSP. In addition, it\r\nwould be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability for\r\nreading the maximum label stack depth and performing EL-based\r\nload-balancing, referred to as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD).\r\nThis document defines a mechanism to signal these two capabilities\r\nusing OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, and Border Gateway Protocol - Link State\r\n(BGP-LS).","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9089","errata_url":null}
