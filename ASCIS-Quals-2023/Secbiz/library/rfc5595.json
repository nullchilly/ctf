It motivates the setting of a\r\nService Code by applications.  Service Codes provide a method to\r\nidentify the intended service\/application to process a DCCP\r\nconnection request.  This provides improved flexibility in the use and\r\nassignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing.  The use of a\r\nDCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of\r\nservices with middleboxes (e.g., network address translators and\r\nfirewalls).  This document updates the specification provided in RFC\r\n4340.
