Each\r\nmobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of\r\nits current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away\r\nfrom its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of\r\naddress, which provides information about the mobile node's current\r\nlocation.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are\r\ntransparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables\r\nIPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with\r\nits care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the\r\nmobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this\r\noperation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new\r\ndestination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary,\r\ncan communicate with mobile nodes.  This document obsoletes RFC 3775.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["[--------]","MIPv6","mobility","IPv6","internet protocol","nodes"],"obsoletes":["RFC3775"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6275","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6275"}
