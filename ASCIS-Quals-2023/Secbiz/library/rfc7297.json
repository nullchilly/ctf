The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters\r\nto be supported by the underlying transport network together with a\r\nreachability scope and bandwidth\/capacity needs.  Appropriate\r\nperformance metrics, such as one-way delay or one-way delay\r\nvariation, are used to characterize an IP transfer service.  Both\r\nglobal and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.\r\n\r\nSuch a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation\r\nof the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus\r\naccelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of\r\nTraffic Engineering functions and service management functions, and\r\n(3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision-\r\nmaking' capabilities based upon negotiated\/offered CPPs.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7297","errata_url":null}
