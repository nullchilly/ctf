CCID 4 is for\r\nexperimental use, and uses TFRC-SP (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC\r\ndesigned for applications that send small packets.  CCID 4 is\r\nconsidered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and\r\nis not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at\r\nthis time.  The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same\r\nbandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up\r\nto 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID 4\r\nis for use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP-\r\nfriendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification\r\n(ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.  This memo defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2009","keywords":["[--------]","ccid 4","congestion control identifier 4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6323","RFC8311"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5622","errata_url":null}
