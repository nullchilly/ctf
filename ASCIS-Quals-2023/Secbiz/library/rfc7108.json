L-Root,\r\none of the thirteen root servers, is deployed in this fashion.\r\n\r\nVarious techniques have been used to map deployed anycast\r\ninfrastructure externally, i.e., without reference to inside\r\nknowledge about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed.\r\nMotivations for performing such measurement exercises include\r\noperational troubleshooting and infrastructure risk assessment.  In\r\nthe specific case of L-Root, the ability to measure and map anycast\r\ninfrastructure using the techniques mentioned in this document is\r\nprovided for reasons of operational transparency.\r\n\r\nThis document describes all facilities deployed at L-Root to\r\nfacilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as documentation\r\nfor L-Root as a measurable service.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7108","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7108"}
