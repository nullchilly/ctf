Many network\r\ndeployments use RSVP-TE or Segment Routing - Traffic Engineering\r\n(SR-TE) to steer traffic over a path that is computed using different\r\nmetrics or constraints than the shortest IGP path. This document\r\nspecifies a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute\r\nconstraint-based paths over the network. This document also specifies\r\na way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to\r\nsteer packets along the constraint-based paths.","pub_date":"February 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9350","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9350"}
