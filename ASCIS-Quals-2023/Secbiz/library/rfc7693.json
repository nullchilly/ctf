BLAKE2 comes in two main\r\nflavors: BLAKE2b is optimized for 64-bit platforms and BLAKE2s for\r\nsmaller architectures.  BLAKE2 can be directly keyed, making it\r\nfunctionally equivalent to a Message Authentication Code (MAC).","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["BLAKE2","Cryptographic Hash"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7693","errata_url":null}
