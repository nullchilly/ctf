The benefits of\r\nS-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control and\r\nflexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["BFD","seamless BFD","negotiation free","label verification","segment routing","IP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7882","errata_url":null}
