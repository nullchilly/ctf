It documents the author's personal views on\r\nhow Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in\r\nInformation-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric\r\nNetworking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which employ\r\nflow-balanced Interest\/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state\r\nas their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols demand\r\na substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP\/IP\r\nand proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification\r\nand differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis.\r\nIt also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU,\r\nand link bandwidth as resources that should be subject to explicitly\r\nunfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are intended to\r\noperate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed\r\nto achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly\r\nexcludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can\r\nonly be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above. \r\n\r\nThis document is not a product of the IRTF Information-Centric\r\nNetworking Research Group (ICNRG) but has been through formal Last\r\nCall and has the support of the participants in the research group\r\nfor publication as an individual submission.","pub_date":"June 2021","keywords":["ICN","QoS","congestion control","admission control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9064","errata_url":null}
