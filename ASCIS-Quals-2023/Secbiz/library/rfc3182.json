The goal of identity representation is to allow a process on a system to securely identify the owner and the application of the communicating process (e.g., user id) and convey this information in RSVP messages (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner.  We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP policy element.  We describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements for multicast merged flows.
