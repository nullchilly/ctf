Discovering a Location Information\r\nServer (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information\r\nfor location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a\r\nresidential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge,\r\nrequiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented\r\nby the gateway.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution\r\nprovides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery\r\nprocess based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["HELD","LIS","Discovery","NAT","Residential Gateway"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7216","errata_url":null}
