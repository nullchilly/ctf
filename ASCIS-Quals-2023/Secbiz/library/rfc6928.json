It discusses the\r\nmotivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages of\r\nthe higher initial window, and presents results from several large-scale\r\nexperiments showing that the higher initial window improves the\r\noverall performance of many web services without resulting in a\r\ncongestion collapse.  The document closes with a discussion of usage\r\nand deployment for further experimental purposes recommended by the\r\nIETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6928","errata_url":null}
