There are\r\nperiodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the RP to keep the\r\nstate alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM\r\nNull-Register message carries information about a single multicast\r\nsource and group.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a standard to send information about multiple\r\nmulticast sources and groups in a single PIM message.
