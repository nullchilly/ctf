This memo is a partial update    of RFC 881.  The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for    the implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.  The names of    hosts will be changed to domain style names.  Hosts will begin to use    domain style names on 14-Mar-84, and the use of old style names will    be completely phased out before 2-May-84.  This applies to both the    ARPA research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.  This is an    official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.
