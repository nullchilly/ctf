It is used for carrying these certificates in Host\r\nIdentity Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the\r\nCERT parameter and the error signaling in case of a failed\r\nverification.  Additionally, this document specifies the\r\nrepresentations of Host Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and\r\nSimple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates.\r\n\r\nThe concrete use of certificates, including how certificates are\r\nobtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or\r\nfailed verification, is specific to the scenario in which the\r\ncertificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-\r\nspecific aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5201.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8002"],"updates":["RFC5201"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6253","errata_url":null}
