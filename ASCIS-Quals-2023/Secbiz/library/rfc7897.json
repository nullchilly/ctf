In this context, a domain is a\r\ncollection of network elements within a common sphere of address\r\nmanagement or path computational responsibility such as an Interior\r\nGateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS).  This\r\ndocument specifies a representation and encoding of a domain\r\nsequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains\r\ntraversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path\r\nComputation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained\r\nshortest paths across a predetermined sequence of domains.  This\r\ndocument also defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain\r\nidentifiers.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["PCEP","PCE","domain","subobjects"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7897","errata_url":null}
