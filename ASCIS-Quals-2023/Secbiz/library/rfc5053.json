The decoder is able to recover the source\r\nblock from any set of encoding symbols only slightly more in number\r\nthan the number of source symbols.\r\n\r\nThe Raptor code described here is a systematic code, meaning that all\r\nthe source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be\r\ngenerated.
