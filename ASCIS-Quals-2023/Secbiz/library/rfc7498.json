The term \"service function                                        \r\nchaining\" is used to describe the definition and instantiation of an\r\nordered list of instances of such service functions, and the\r\nsubsequent \"steering\" of traffic flows through those service\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThe set of enabled service function chains reflects operator service\r\nofferings and is designed in conjunction with application delivery\r\nand service and network policy.\r\n\r\nThis document also identifies several key areas that the Service\r\nFunction Chaining (SFC) working group will investigate to guide its\r\narchitectural and protocol work and associated documents.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["service function chaining","steering","sfc"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7498","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7498"}
