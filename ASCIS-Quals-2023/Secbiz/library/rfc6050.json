The use of these extensions is\r\nonly applicable inside an administrative domain with previously\r\nagreed-upon policies for generation, transport, and usage of such\r\ninformation.  This document does NOT offer a general service\r\nidentification model suitable for use between different trust domains\r\nor for use in the Internet at large.\r\n\r\nThe document also defines a URN to identify both services and User\r\nAgent (UA) applications.  This URN can be used within the SIP header\r\nfields defined in this document to identify services, and also within\r\nthe framework defined for caller preferences and callee capabilities\r\nto identify usage of both services and applications between end UAs. \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2010","keywords":["SIP","trust domain","service identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6050","errata_url":null}
