The requirements identified in this document are\r\nrelated to architecture, signaling, and maintenance aspects of\r\npoint-to-multipoint PW operation.  They are proposed as guidelines\r\nfor the standardization of such mechanisms.  Among other potential\r\napplications, point-to-multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the\r\nsupport of multicast Layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service\r\nand Virtual Private Multicast Service).","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7338","errata_url":null}
