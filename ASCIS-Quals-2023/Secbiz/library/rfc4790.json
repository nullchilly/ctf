However, the problem space for\r\nsearching and sorting international strings is large, not fully\r\nexplored, and is outside the area of expertise for the Internet\r\nEngineering Task Force (IETF).  Rather than attempt to solve such a\r\nlarge problem, this specification creates an abstraction framework so\r\nthat application protocols can precisely identify a comparison\r\nfunction, and the repertoire of comparison functions can be extended\r\nin the future.
