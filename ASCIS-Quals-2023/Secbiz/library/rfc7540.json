HTTP\/2 enables a more efficient use of network\r\nresources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header\r\nfield compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the\r\nsame connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of\r\nrepresentations from servers to clients.\r\n\r\nThis specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the\r\nHTTP\/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["HTTP","SPDY","Web"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9113"],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8740"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7540","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7540"}
