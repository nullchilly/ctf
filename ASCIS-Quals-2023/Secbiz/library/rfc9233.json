Some additions and\r\nchanges have been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the values\r\nproduced by the algorithm IDNA2008 specifies. IDNA2008 allows adding\r\nexceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility; however, this\r\ndocument does not add any such exceptions. This document provides the\r\nnecessary tables to IANA to make its database consistent with Unicode\r\n12.0.0. \r\n\r\nTo improve understanding, this document describes systems that are\r\nbeing used as alternatives to those that conform to IDNA2008.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":["IDN","IDNA","IDNA2008"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9233","errata_url":null}
