The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.  Two separate MIME type registrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage format.
