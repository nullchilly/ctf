This ability to bypass the server for data access can\r\nincrease both performance and parallelism, but requires additional\r\nclient functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on\r\nthe class of storage used, a.k.a. the Layout Type.  The main pNFS\r\noperations and data types in NFSv4 Minor version 1 specify a layout-\r\ntype-independent layer; layout-type-specific information is conveyed\r\nusing opaque data structures whose internal structure is further\r\ndefined by the particular layout type specification.  This document\r\nspecifies the NFSv4.1 Object-Based pNFS Layout Type as a companion to\r\nthe main NFSv4 Minor version 1 specification.
