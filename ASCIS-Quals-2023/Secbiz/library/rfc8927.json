Its main goals are to enable code generation from schemas\r\nas well as portable validation with standardized error indicators. To\r\nthis end, JTD is intentionally limited to be no more expressive than\r\nthe type systems of mainstream programming languages. This\r\nintentional limitation, as well as the decision to make JTD schemas\r\nbe JSON documents, makes tooling atop of JTD easier to build.\r\n\r\nThis document does not have IETF consensus and is presented here to\r\nfacilitate experimentation with the concept of JTD.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["data interchange format","description language","schema language","tree grammar"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8927","errata_url":null}
