These PCEP extensions can be applied\r\neither using a stateful PCE for both PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated\r\nLSPs or using a stateless PCE. The PCEP procedures defined are\r\napplicable to the LSPs using RSVP-TE for signaling.","pub_date":"June 2021","keywords":["RSVP-TE LSP","Co-routed LSP","Reverse LSP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9059","errata_url":null}
