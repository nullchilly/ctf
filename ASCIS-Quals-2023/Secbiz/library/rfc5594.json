The workshop was held\r\non May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the\r\nworkshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs\r\nand end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P\r\ntraffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in\r\naddressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the\r\nIETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work\r\nitems were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter\r\ngoal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work\r\nitems that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.  \r\nThis memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2009","keywords":["P2PI"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5594","errata_url":null}
