SCTP is a new protocol that provides\r\nseveral features that may prove beneficial for transport between SIP\r\nentities that exchange a large amount of messages, including\r\ngateways and proxies.  As SIP is transport-independent, support of\r\nSCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to\r\nsupport for TCP.
