Additionally, existing\r\nmechanisms have some feature gaps that need to be identified and\r\nresolved in order for them to address the pervasive monitoring threat\r\nmodel. This specification describes best practices for negotiating\r\nconfidential media with SIP, including a comprehensive protection\r\nsolution that binds the media layer to SIP layer identities.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["SIP","RTP","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0228"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8862","errata_url":null}
