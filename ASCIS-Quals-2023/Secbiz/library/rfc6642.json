This overload is usually avoided by\r\nensuring that feedback reports are forwarded to all receivers,\r\nallowing them to avoid sending duplicate feedback reports.  However,\r\nthere are cases where it is not recommended to forward feedback\r\nreports, and this may allow feedback implosion.  This memo discusses\r\nthese cases and defines a new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report that can\r\nbe used to inform receivers that the feedback target is aware of some\r\nloss event, allowing them to suppress feedback.  Associated Session\r\nDescription Protocol (SDP) signaling is also defined.
