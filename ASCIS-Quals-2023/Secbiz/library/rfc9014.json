The solution analyzes\r\nthe interaction between NVO networks running Ethernet Virtual Private\r\nNetworks (EVPNs) and other Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) technologies used in\r\nthe WAN, such as Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs), VPLS\r\nextensions for Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB-VPLS), EVPN, or\r\nPBB-EVPN. It also describes how the existing technical specifications\r\napply to the interconnection and extends the EVPN procedures needed\r\nin some cases. In particular, this document describes how EVPN routes\r\nare processed on Gateways (GWs) that interconnect EVPN-Overlay and\r\nEVPN-MPLS networks, as well as the Interconnect Ethernet Segment\r\n(I-ES), to provide multihoming. This document also describes the use\r\nof the Unknown MAC Route (UMR) to avoid issues of a Media Access\r\nControl (MAC) scale on Data Center Network Virtualization Edge (NVE)\r\ndevices.","pub_date":"May 2021","keywords":["DCI","UMR","Unknown MAC Route","I-ES","I-ESI"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9014","errata_url":null}
