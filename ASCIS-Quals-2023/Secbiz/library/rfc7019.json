The ALM Usage is intended\r\nto support a variety of ALM control algorithms in an\r\noverlay-independent way.  Two example algorithms are defined, based\r\non Scribe and P2PCast.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast\r\nResearch Group (SAM RG).","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["application-layer multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7019","errata_url":null}
