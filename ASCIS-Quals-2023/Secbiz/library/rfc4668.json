These extensions represent a\r\nportion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network\r\nmanagement protocols in the Internet community.  Using these\r\nextensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS\r\nauthentication clients.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 2618 by deprecating the MIB table containing\r\nIPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for\r\nversion-neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB objects from\r\nRFC 2618 are carried forward into this document.  The memo also adds\r\nUNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.
