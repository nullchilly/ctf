Network Virtualization decouples virtual networks and\r\naddresses from physical network infrastructure, providing isolation\r\nand concurrency between multiple virtual networks on the same\r\nphysical network infrastructure.  This document also introduces a\r\nNetwork Virtualization framework to illustrate the use cases, but\r\nthe focus is on specifying the data-plane aspect of NVGRE.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7637","errata_url":null}
