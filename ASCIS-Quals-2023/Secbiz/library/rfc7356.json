There are existing use cases where support of other flooding\r\nscopes is desirable.  This document defines new Protocol Data Units\r\n(PDUs) that provide support for new flooding scopes as well as\r\nadditional space for advertising information targeted for the\r\ncurrently supported flooding scopes.  This document also defines\r\nextended Type-Length-Values (TLVs) and sub-TLVs that are encoded\r\nusing 16-bit fields for Type and Length.\r\n\r\nThe protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards\r\ncompatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed with\r\ncare.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7356","errata_url":null}
