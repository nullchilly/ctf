RRDP was\r\nspecifically designed for scaling.  It relies on an Update\r\nNotification File which lists the current Snapshot and Delta Files\r\nthat can be retrieved using HTTPS (HTTP over Transport Layer Security\r\n(TLS)), and it enables the use of Content Distribution Networks\r\n(CDNs) or other caching infrastructures for the retrieval of these\r\nfiles.","pub_date":"July 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8182","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8182"}
