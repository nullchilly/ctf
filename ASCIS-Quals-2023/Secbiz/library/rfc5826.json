In the near future, many homes will\r\ncontain high numbers of wireless devices for a wide set of\r\npurposes.  Examples include actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating\r\nvalve), sensors (wall switch, water leak, blood pressure), and\r\nadvanced controllers (radio-frequency-based AV remote control, central\r\nserver for light and heat control).  Because such devices only cover a\r\nlimited radio range, routing is often required.  The aim of this\r\ndocument is to specify the routing requirements for networks\r\ncomprising such constrained devices in a home-control and automation\r\nenvironment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2010","keywords":["roll","routing over low power and lossy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5826","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5826"}
