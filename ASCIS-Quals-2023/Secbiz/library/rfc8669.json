A node\r\nsteers a packet through an ordered list of instructions called\r\n\"segments\". A segment can represent any instruction, topological or\r\nservice based. The ingress node prepends an SR header to a packet\r\ncontaining a set of segment identifiers (SIDs). Each SID represents a\r\ntopological or service-based instruction. Per-flow state is\r\nmaintained only on the ingress node of the SR domain. An \"SR domain\"\r\nis defined as a single administrative domain for global SID\r\nassignment.\r\n\r\nThis document defines an optional, transitive BGP attribute for\r\nannouncing information about BGP Prefix Segment Identifiers (BGP\r\nPrefix-SIDs) and the specification for SR-MPLS SIDs.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["SR","MPLS","BGP","Prefix-SID","Label-Index","SRGB"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8669","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8669"}
