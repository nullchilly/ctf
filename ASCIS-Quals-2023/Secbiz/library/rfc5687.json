This protocol aims to allow an end\r\nhost to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a\r\nLocation Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access\r\nnetwork.  The obtained location information can then be used for a\r\nvariety of different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be\r\nused as input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol\r\nor to convey location within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to\r\nother entities.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["Location Information","Location Information Server","Location by Value","Location by Reference"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5687","errata_url":null}
