For efficient network communication, it\r\nis vital for a protocol layer to know or utilize other layers'\r\ninformation, such as the form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol\r\nlayer is basically designed independently.  Since each protocol layer\r\nis also implemented independently in current operating systems, it is\r\nvery hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.\r\nThis document defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of\r\n\"primitives\" to achieve fast handovers in the network layer as a means\r\nof solving the problem.  This mechanism is called \"L3-driven fast\r\nhandovers\" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by\r\nusing the primitives.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility\r\nOptimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This memo defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2008","keywords":["l2 triggers","primitives","l3-driven fast handover","ip mobility optimizations","mobopts"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5184","errata_url":null}
