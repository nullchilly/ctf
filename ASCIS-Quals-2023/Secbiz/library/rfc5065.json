Scudder"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"14","pub_status":"DRAFT STANDARD","status":"DRAFT STANDARD","source":"Inter-Domain Routing","abstract":"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system\r\nrouting protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet\r\nProtocol (TCP\/IP) networks.  BGP requires that all BGP speakers\r\nwithin a single autonomous system (AS) must be fully meshed.  This\r\nrepresents a serious scaling problem that has been well documented in\r\na number of proposals.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an extension to BGP that may be used to\r\ncreate a confederation of autonomous systems that is represented as a\r\nsingle autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation,\r\nthereby removing the \"full mesh\" requirement.  The intention of this\r\nextension is to aid in policy administration and reduce the\r\nmanagement complexity of maintaining a large autonomous system.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3065.
