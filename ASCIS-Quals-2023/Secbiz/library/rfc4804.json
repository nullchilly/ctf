This\r\ndocument specifies aggregation of RSVP end-to-end reservations over\r\nMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels or MPLS Diffserv-aware MPLS\r\nTraffic Engineering (DS-TE) tunnels.  This approach is based on\r\nRFC 3175 and simply modifies the corresponding procedures for\r\noperations over MPLS TE tunnels instead of aggregate RSVP\r\nreservations.  This approach can be used to achieve\r\nadmission control of a very large number of flows in a scalable\r\nmanner since the devices in the core of the network are unaware of\r\nthe end-to-end RSVP reservations and are only aware of the MPLS TE\r\ntunnels.
