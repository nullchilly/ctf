The \"Early Retransmit\" mechanism allows the\r\ntransport to reduce, in certain special circumstances, the number of duplicate\r\nacknowledgments required to trigger a fast retransmission.  This allows the\r\ntransport to use fast retransmit to recover segment losses that would\r\notherwise require a lengthy retransmission timeout.
