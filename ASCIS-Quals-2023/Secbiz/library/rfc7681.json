Existing standards are applied to\r\nprevent unauthorized alteration of transcript content and to deliver\r\ntranscripts directly and securely from each student to his or her\r\nchosen recipients.  By eliminating third-party intervention and\r\nsurveillance, the defined protocol better protects student privacy\r\nand independence than does current practice.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["Internet Applications","email","school transcript","MIME","OpenPGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7681","errata_url":null}
