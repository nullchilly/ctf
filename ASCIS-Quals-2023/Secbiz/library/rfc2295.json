Transparent content negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is accessed.  This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
