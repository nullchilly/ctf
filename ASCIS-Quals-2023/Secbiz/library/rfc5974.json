Together with General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it\r\nprovides functionality similar to RSVP and extends it.  The QoS NSLP\r\nis independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture\r\nand provides support for different reservation models.  It is\r\nsimplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This\r\nspecification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the\r\ndesign decisions made, and provides examples.  It specifies object,\r\nmessage formats, and processing rules.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["QoS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5974","errata_url":null}
