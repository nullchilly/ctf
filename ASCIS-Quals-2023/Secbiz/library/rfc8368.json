Changes in\r\ncore network functions impacting reachability cannot be automated\r\nbecause of ongoing connectivity requirements for the OAM equipment\r\nitself, and widely used OAM protocols are not secure enough to be\r\ncarried across the network without security concerns.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how to integrate OAM processes with an\r\nautonomic control plane in order to provide stable and secure\r\nconnectivity for those OAM processes.  This connectivity is not\r\nsubject to the aforementioned circular dependencies.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["autonomic networking","autonomous operation","self-management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8368","errata_url":null}
