These include optical networks such as time division\r\nmultiplexing (TDM) networks including the Synchronous Optical\r\nNetwork\/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET\/SDH), Optical Transport\r\nNetworks (OTNs), and lambda switching optical networks.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements of\r\nASON routing and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocols\r\nare provided in other documents.  This document defines extensions to\r\nthe OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for\r\nrouting in an ASON.\r\n\r\nNote that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation\r\nexpressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations\r\nthat were current when those documents were written.  Future extensions or\r\nrevisions of this work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendations\r\nare revised or if new requirements are introduced into a revision of\r\nRFC 4258.  This document obsoletes RFC 5787 and updates RFC 5786.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":["RFC5787"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5786"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6827","errata_url":null}
