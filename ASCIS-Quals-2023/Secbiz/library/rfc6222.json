While the\r\nSynchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may\r\nchange if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is\r\nrestarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP\r\nendpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP\r\nmedia streams.  For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be\r\nunique within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the\r\nexisting guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP\r\nstandard are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  This memo\r\nupdates those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP\r\nCNAMEs.
