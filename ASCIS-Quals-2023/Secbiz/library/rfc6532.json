MIME added\r\nsupport for the use of 8-bit character sets in body parts, and also\r\ndefined an encoded-word construct so other character sets could be\r\nused in certain header field values.  However, full\r\ninternationalization of electronic mail requires additional\r\nenhancements to allow the use of Unicode, including characters\r\noutside the ASCII repertoire, in mail addresses as well as direct use\r\nof Unicode in header fields like \"From:\", \"To:\", and \"Subject:\",\r\nwithout requiring the use of complex encoded-word constructs.  This\r\ndocument specifies an enhancement to the Internet Message Format and\r\nto MIME that allows use of Unicode in mail addresses and most header\r\nfield content.\r\n\r\nThis specification updates Section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to eliminate the\r\nrestriction prohibiting the use of non-identity content-transfer-\r\nencodings on subtypes of \"message\/\".
