While the IPv6 address\r\narchitecture in Section 2.2 of RFC 4291 describes a flexible model\r\nfor text representation of an IPv6 address, this flexibility has been\r\ncausing problems for operators, system engineers, and users.  This\r\ndocument defines a canonical textual representation format.  It does\r\nnot define a format for internal storage, such as within an\r\napplication or database.  It is expected that the canonical format\r\nwill be followed by humans and systems when representing IPv6\r\naddresses as text, but all implementations must accept and be able to\r\nhandle any legitimate RFC 4291 format.
