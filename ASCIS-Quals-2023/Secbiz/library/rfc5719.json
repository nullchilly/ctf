RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that\r\nlead to the need to define a new Diameter application or a new\r\ncommand code.  Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension, IETF\r\nactions are necessary.  Although defining new Diameter applications\r\ndoes not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands\r\nrequires IETF consensus per RFC 3588.  This has led to questionable\r\ndesign decisions by other Standards Development Organizations, which\r\nchose to define new applications on existing commands -- rather than\r\nasking for assignment of new command codes -- for the pure purpose of\r\navoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF.  In some cases,\r\ninteroperability problems were an effect of the poor design caused by\r\noverloading existing commands.\r\n\r\nThis document aligns the extensibility rules of the Diameter\r\napplication with the Diameter commands, offering ways to delegate\r\nwork on Diameter to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does\r\nnot lead to poor design choices.
