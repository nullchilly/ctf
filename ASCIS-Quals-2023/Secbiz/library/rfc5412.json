The general goal has been to move most\r\nof the traditional wireless functionality such as access control\r\n(user authentication and authorization), mobility, and radio\r\nmanagement out of the access point into a centralized controller.\r\n\r\nThe IETF's CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points)\r\nWG has identified that a standards-based protocol is necessary between\r\na wireless Access Controller and Wireless Termination Points (the\r\nlatter are also commonly referred to as Lightweight Access Points).\r\nThis specification defines the Lightweight Access Point Protocol\r\n(LWAPP), which addresses the CAPWAP's (Control and Provisioning of\r\nWireless Access Points) protocol requirements.  Although the LWAPP\r\nprotocol is designed to be flexible enough to be used for a variety of\r\nwireless technologies, this specific document describes the base\r\nprotocol and an extension that allows it to be used with the IEEE's\r\n802.11 wireless LAN protocol.  This document defines a Historic Document\r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["lwapp","capwap"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5412","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5412"}
