The memo presents its advice in the context of a\r\nnetwork musical performance application.  In this application two\r\nmusicians, located in different physical locations, interact over a\r\nnetwork to perform as they would if located in the same room.\r\nUnderlying the performances are RTP MIDI sessions over unicast UDP.\r\nAlgorithms for sending and receiving recovery journals (the resiliency\r\nstructure for the payload format) are described in detail.  Although\r\nthe memo focuses on network musical performance, the presented\r\nimplementation advice is relevant to other RTP MIDI applications.
