This deployment approach incurs a high\r\nrisk of service interruption, since at least one domain will not\r\noffer PE node redundancy.  This document describes an inter-domain\r\nVPLS solution that provides PE node redundancy across domains.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":["ICCP","PW"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7309","errata_url":null}
