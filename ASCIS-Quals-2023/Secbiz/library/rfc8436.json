The\r\nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of\r\nassigned DSCP values.\r\n\r\nThis update to RFC 2474 changes the IANA registration policy for Pool\r\n3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards\r\nAction, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best\r\nCurrent Practice RFC.  The update also removes permission for\r\nexperimental and local use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the\r\nDSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form\r\nxxxx11) remain available for these purposes.","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["Diffserv","DSCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2474"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8436","errata_url":null}
