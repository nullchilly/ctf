These extensions provide a way to distribute\r\nand collect network-performance information in a scalable fashion.\r\nThe information distributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions can then\r\nbe used to make path-selection decisions based on network\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nNote that this document only covers the mechanisms with which\r\nnetwork-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for\r\nmeasuring network performance or acting on that information, once\r\ndistributed, are outside the scope of this document.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 7810.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["IGP","IS-IS"],"obsoletes":["RFC7810"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8570","errata_url":null}
