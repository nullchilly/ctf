This method reuses, and extends\r\nwhere necessary, the \"BGP\/MPLS IP VPN\" method for support\r\nof IPv6.  In BGP\/MPLS IP VPN, \"Multiprotocol BGP\" is used for\r\ndistributing IPv4 VPN routes over the service provider backbone, and\r\nMPLS is used to forward IPv4 VPN packets over the backbone.  This\r\ndocument defines an IPv6 VPN address family and describes the\r\ncorresponding IPv6 VPN route distribution in \"Multiprotocol BGP\".\r\n\r\nThis document defines support of the IPv6 VPN service over both an\r\nIPv4 and an IPv6 backbone, and for using various tunneling techniques\r\nover the core, including MPLS, IP-in-IP, Generic Routing Encapsulation\r\n(GRE) and IPsec protected tunnels.  The inter-working between an IPv4\r\nsite and an IPv6 site is outside the scope of this document.
