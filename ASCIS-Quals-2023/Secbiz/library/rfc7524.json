The intra-area P2MP LSPs may be signaled using\r\nP2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP multipoint LDP (mLDP).  If ingress replication is\r\nused within an IGP area, then (multipoint-to-point) LDP LSPs or\r\n(point-to-point) RSVP-TE LSPs may be used in the IGP area.  The\r\napplications\/services that use such inter-area service LSPs may be BGP\r\nMulticast VPN, Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) multicast, or global\r\ntable multicast over MPLS.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8534"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7524","errata_url":null}
