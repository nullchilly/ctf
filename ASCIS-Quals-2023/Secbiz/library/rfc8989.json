It therefore also\r\nupdates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall\r\npetition. The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view\r\nof increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in\r\nface-to-face meetings. The experiment is of fixed duration and will\r\napply to one, or at most two, consecutive Nominating Committee\r\ncycles, starting in 2021. This document temporarily varies the rules\r\nin RFC 8713.","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9389"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8989","errata_url":null}
