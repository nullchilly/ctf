Endpoints in closed\r\nenvironments typically agree out-of-band (e.g., using configuration\r\ninformation) regarding which QoS mechanism to use.  However, on the Internet,\r\nthere is more than one QoS service available.  Consequently, there is\r\na need for a mechanism to negotiate which QoS mechanism to use for a\r\nparticular media stream.  This document defines such a mechanism.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["[--------]","offer\/answer","media stream"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5432","errata_url":null}
