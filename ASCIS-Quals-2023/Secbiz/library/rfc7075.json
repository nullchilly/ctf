In some\r\ncircumstances, an operator may wish to redirect messages to an\r\nalternate domain without specifying individual hosts.  This document\r\nspecifies an application-specific mechanism by which a Diameter\r\nserver or proxy (node) can perform such a redirection when the\r\nStraightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) is not used for\r\ndynamic peer discovery.  A node performing this new function is\r\nreferred to as a \"Realm-based Redirect Server\".\r\n\r\nThis memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC 6733 with respect to\r\nthe usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time\r\nAttribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["Diameter","routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6733"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7075","errata_url":null}
