Such a node may wish to obtain IPv4 and\/or IPv6\r\nconfiguration settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\r\n(DHCP).  The original version of DHCP (RFC 2131) designed for IPv4\r\nhas now been complemented by a new DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) for IPv6.  This\r\ndocument describes issues identified with dual IP version DHCP\r\ninteractions, the most important aspect of which is how to handle\r\npotential problems in clients processing configuration information\r\nreceived from both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.  The document makes a\r\nrecommendation on the general strategy on how best to handle such\r\nissues and identifies future work to be undertaken.
