This memo presents an experimental database and a\r\ndiscussion of methods to transport the mapping of Endpoint IDs (EIDs)\r\nto Routing Locators (RLOCs) to routers in a reliable, scalable, and\r\nsecure manner.  Our analysis concludes that transport of all EID-to-\r\nRLOC mappings scales well to at least 10^8 entries.  This document \r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6837","errata_url":null}
