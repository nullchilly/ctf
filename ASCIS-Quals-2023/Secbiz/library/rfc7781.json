Active-active access at the TRILL edge is the extension of\r\nthese characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to\r\na TRILL campus as discussed in RFC 7379.  In this document, the edge\r\nRBridge (Routing Bridge, or TRILL switch) group providing\r\nactive-active access to such an end station is represented as a\r\nvirtual RBridge.  Based on the concept of the virtual RBridge, along\r\nwith its pseudo-nickname, this document specifies a method for TRILL\r\nactive-active access by such end stations.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["virtual RBridge","aggregation","flip-flopping"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7781","errata_url":null}
