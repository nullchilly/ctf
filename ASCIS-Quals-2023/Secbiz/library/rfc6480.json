The foundation of this\r\narchitecture is a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that\r\nrepresents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and\r\nAutonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository system\r\nfor storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the\r\nRPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing\r\nsecurity.  As an initial application of this architecture, the\r\ndocument describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can\r\nexplicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate\r\nroutes to that address space.  Such verifiable authorizations could be\r\nused, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["RPKI","BGP","ROA"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6480","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6480"}
