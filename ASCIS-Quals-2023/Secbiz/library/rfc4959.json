This\r\nadditional round trip at the beginning of the session is undesirable,\r\nespecially when round-trip costs are high.\r\n\r\nThis document defines an extension to IMAP which allows clients and\r\nservers to avoid this round trip by allowing an initial client response\r\nargument to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command.
