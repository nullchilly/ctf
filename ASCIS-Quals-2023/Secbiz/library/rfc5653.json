This document\r\nupdates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in\r\n\"Generic Security Service API Version 2 : Java Bindings\" (RFC 2853).\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2853 by making specific and incremental\r\nclarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of\r\ntranscription errors and implementation experience.\r\n\r\nThe GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in\r\n\"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2,\r\nUpdate 1\" (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to\r\nauthenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and\r\nto apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a\r\nper-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for\r\nGSS-API are \"The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism\" (RFC 2025) and\r\n\"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program\r\nInterface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2\" (RFC 4121).
