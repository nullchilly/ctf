It is done by specifying a bit in the DATA\r\nchunk header, called the (I)mmediate bit, which can get set by either\r\nthe Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation or the\r\napplication using an SCTP stack.  Since unknown flags in chunk\r\nheaders are ignored by SCTP implementations, this extension does not\r\nintroduce any interoperability problems.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9260"],"updates":["RFC4960"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7053","errata_url":null}
