Previous work has\r\nreplicated some of that service class as a profile within Internet\r\nmail.  The current specification defines \"full mode\" carriage of\r\nfacsimile data over the Internet, building upon that previous work\r\nand adding the remaining functionality necessary for achieving\r\nreliability and capability negotiation for Internet mail, on a par\r\nwith classic T.30 facsimile.  These additional features are designed\r\nto provide the highest level of interoperability with the\r\nstandards-compliant email infrastructure and mail user agents, while\r\nproviding a level of service that approximates what is currently enjoyed by fax\r\nusers.
