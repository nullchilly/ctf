When\r\ncomputing or reoptimizing the routes of a set of Traffic Engineering\r\nLabel Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through a network, it may be\r\nadvantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid\r\nblocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions.\r\nSuch bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO).\r\nA GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the\r\nnetwork and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective\r\nconstraints, and look to optimize or reoptimize the entire network to\r\nsatisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs.  A GCO may also be applied to\r\nsome subset of the TE LSPs in a network.  The GCO application is\r\nprimarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.\r\n\r\nThis document provides application-specific requirements and the PCEP\r\nextensions in support of GCO applications.
