Only Protocol\r\nIndependent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its\r\nthree main operational modes: the traditional Any-Source Multicast\r\n(ASM) model, the source-specific multicast (SSM) model, and the ASM\r\nmodel enhanced by the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP)\r\ngroup-to-RP mapping mechanism.  This memo also describes enhancements\r\nto the protocol operations that mitigate the identified threats.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2006","keywords":["security threats","intra-domain","inter-domain","any-source multicast","asm","source-specific multicast","ssm","embedded rendezvous point","embedded-rp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4609","errata_url":null}
