It provides encodings for a number of tunnel\r\ntypes, along with procedures for choosing between alternate tunnels\r\nand routing packets into tunnels.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5512, which provided an earlier\r\ndefinition of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. RFC 5512 was never\r\ndeployed in production. Since RFC 5566 relies on RFC 5512, it is\r\nlikewise obsoleted. This document updates RFC 5640 by indicating that\r\nthe Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV may be included in any Tunnel\r\nEncapsulation attribute where load balancing is desired.","pub_date":"April 2021","keywords":["BGP"],"obsoletes":["RFC5512","RFC5566"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5640"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9012","errata_url":null}
