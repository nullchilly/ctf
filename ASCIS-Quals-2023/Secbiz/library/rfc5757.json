It describes problems arising from mobile group\r\ncommunication in general, the case of multicast listener mobility,\r\nand problems for mobile senders using Any Source Multicast and \r\nSource-Specific Multicast.  Characteristic aspects of multicast \r\nrouting and deployment issues for fixed IPv6 networks are summarized.\r\nSpecific properties and interplays with the underlying network access are \r\nsurveyed with respect to the relevant technologies in the wireless \r\ndomain.  It outlines the principal approaches to multicast mobility, \r\ntogether with a comprehensive exploration of the mobile multicast \r\nproblem and solution space.  This document concludes with a conceptual \r\nroad map for initial steps in standardization for use by future mobile\r\nmulticast protocol designers.  This document is a product of the IP\r\nMobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This document is not an \r\nInternet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["PMIPv6","FMIPv6","HMIPv6","SSM","ASM","MLD","Mobile Multicast Routing","Hybrid Multicast","Wireless","Multipoint"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5757","errata_url":null}
