As IPv6-capable SMTP servers are deployed, it has become apparent that certain configurations of MX records are necessary for stable dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) SMTP operation.  This document clarifies the existing problems in the transition period between IPv4 SMTP and IPv6 SMTP.  It also defines operational requirements for stable IPv4\/v6 SMTP operation. \r\n\r\n This document does not define any new protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
