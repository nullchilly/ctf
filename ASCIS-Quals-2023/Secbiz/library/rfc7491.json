They need on-demand and application-specific\r\nreservation of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such\r\nas bandwidth) in a variety of network applications (such as\r\npoint-to-point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile\r\nback-haul) and in a range of network technologies from packet\r\n(IP\/MPLS) down to optical.  An environment that operates to meet\r\nthese types of requirements is said to have Application-Based\r\nNetwork Operations (ABNO).  ABNO brings together many existing\r\ntechnologies and may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing\r\ncomponents enhanced with a few new elements.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO,\r\nshowing how these components fit together.  It provides a cookbook of\r\nexisting technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs\r\nof the applications.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":["Software-Defined Networking (SDN)","Path Computation Element (PCE)","Network management","Network programming"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7491","errata_url":null}
