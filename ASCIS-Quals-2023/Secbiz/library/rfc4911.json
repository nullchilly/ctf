Some of these encoding\r\ninstructions also affect how an ASN.1 specification is translated\r\ninto an Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) specification.  Encoding\r\ninstructions that allow an ASN.1 specification to reference\r\ndefinitions in other XML schema languages are also defined.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","extensible markup language","asn.1","abstract syntax notation one","robust xml encoding rules","rxer","canonical robust xml encoding rules","crxer","asn.x"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4911","errata_url":null}
