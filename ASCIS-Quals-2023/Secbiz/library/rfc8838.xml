        This document describes "Trickle ICE", an extension to the Interactive
        Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that enables ICE agents
        to begin connectivity checks while they are still gathering 
        candidates, by incrementally exchanging candidates over time instead
        of all at once. This method can considerably accelerate the process 
        of establishing a communication session.

        The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol 
        <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/> describes how an ICE agent 
        gathers candidates, exchanges candidates with a peer ICE 
        agent, and creates candidate pairs. Once the pairs have been 
        gathered, the ICE agent will perform connectivity checks and 
        eventually nominate and select pairs that will be used for 
        sending and receiving data within a communication session.

        Following the procedures in <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/>
        can lead to somewhat lengthy establishment times for communication
        sessions, because candidate gathering often involves querying Session
        Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) servers <xref target="RFC5389" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5389"/> and allocating relayed candidates on Traversal
        Using Relay NAT (TURN) servers <xref target="RFC5766" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5766"/>. Although many ICE procedures can be completed in
        parallel, the pacing requirements from <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/> still need to be followed.

        This document defines "Trickle ICE", a supplementary mode of ICE 
        operation in which candidates can be exchanged 
        incrementally as soon as they become available (and simultaneously 
        with the gathering of other candidates). Connectivity checks can 
        also start as soon as candidate pairs have been created. Because 
        Trickle ICE enables candidate gathering and connectivity checks
        to be done in parallel, the method can considerably accelerate
        the process of establishing a communication session.

        modified or supplemented when using Trickle ICE, and how a Trickle 
        ICE agent can interoperate with an ICE agent compliant to

        Trickle ICE, going back as far as 2005 (when the XMPP Jingle extension 
        defined a "dribble mode" as specified in <xref target="XEP-0176" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="XEP-0176"/>); this

        server-reflexive candidates that match the host addresses they
        were obtained from (e.g., when the latter are public IPv4

        Next, the agent "trickles" the newly discovered
        candidate(s) to the remote agent. The actual delivery of the new

        Trickle ICE imposes no restrictions on the way this is done 
        (e.g., some using protocols might
        choose not to trickle updates for server-reflexive
        candidates and instead rely on the discovery of peer-reflexive ones).

        and ignored by the receiving party.  For example, using protocols

        In half trickle, the initiator conveys the initial ICE description
        with a usable but not necessarily full generation of candidates. This

        responder and is mostly meant for use in cases where support for 
        Trickle ICE cannot be confirmed prior to conveying the initial ICE 
        description.  The initial ICE description indicates support for 
        Trickle ICE, so that the responder can respond with something less 
        than a full generation of candidates and then trickle the rest.  
        The initial ICE description for half trickle can contain 
        an end-of-candidates indication, although this is not mandatory

        The half-trickle mechanism can be used in cases where there is

        a full generation of candidates, it can thus be handled by a regular
        ICE agent, while still allowing a Trickle ICE agent to use
        the optimization defined in this specification. This prevents
        negotiation from failing in the former case while still giving
        roughly half the Trickle ICE benefits in the latter.

        Use of half trickle is only necessary during an initial

        an ICE description from their peer, they can each reliably
        determine Trickle ICE support and use it for all subsequent

        In some instances, using half trickle might bring more than 
        just half the improvement in terms of user experience. 


        This 
        can happen when an agent starts gathering candidates upon user-interface 
        cues that the user will soon be initiating an interaction, 
        such as activity on a keypad or the phone going off hook. This 
        would mean that some or all of the candidate
        gathering could be completed before the agent actually
        needs to convey the candidate information. Because the responder will be able
        to trickle candidates, both agents will be able to start
        connectivity checks and complete ICE processing earlier than
        with regular ICE and potentially even as early as with full
        trickle.

        However, such anticipation is not always possible. For
        example, a multipurpose user agent or a WebRTC web page where
        communication is a non-central feature (e.g., calling a support
        line in case of a problem with the main features) would not
        necessarily have a way of distinguishing between call
        intentions and other user activity. In such cases, using full
        trickle is most likely to result in an ideal user experience.
        Even so, using half trickle would be an improvement over regular
        ICE because it would result in a better experience for responders.

        One important aspect of regular ICE is that connectivity checks
        for a specific foundation and component are attempted
        simultaneously by both agents, so that any firewalls or NATs
        fronting the agents would whitelist both endpoints and allow
        all except for the first ("suicide") packets to go through. This
        is also important to unfreezing candidates at the right time. While 
        not crucial, preserving this behavior in Trickle ICE is likely to 
        improve ICE performance.

        To achieve this, when trickling candidates, agents <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respect the

        <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be conveyed prior to candidates for a component with a 
        lower ID number within the same foundation. In addition, candidates

It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.</t>
              <t indent="0">STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.  This is an important change from the previous version of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.</t>

In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

        STUN server. By the time Bob's answer is ready and conveyed to
        Alice, Bob's connectivity checks might have failed: until
        Alice gets Bob's answer, she won't be able to start connectivity
        checks and punch holes in her NAT. The NAT would hence be
        filtering Bob's checks as originating from an unknown endpoint.

        When performing full trickle, a full ICE implementation could

        a response that
        identifies the remote agent as an ICE-lite implementation, the
        initiator can choose to not trickle any additional
        candidates. The same is also true in the case when the ICE-lite
        agent initiates the interaction and the full ICE agent is the responder. In
        these cases, the connectivity checks would be enough for the ICE-lite
        implementation to discover all potentially useful
