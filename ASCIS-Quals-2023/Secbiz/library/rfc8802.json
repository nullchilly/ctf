The Quality for Service (Q4S) protocol provides a\r\nmechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth, and\r\npacket loss, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions\r\nis violated.\r\n\r\nImplementation details on the actions to be triggered upon\r\nreception\/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out\r\nof scope of this document; it is either application dependent (e.g.,\r\nact to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent\r\n(e.g., change connection's quality profile).\r\n\r\nThis protocol specification is the product of research conducted over\r\na number of years; it is presented here as a permanent record and to\r\noffer a foundation for future similar work.  It does not represent a\r\nstandard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["quality measurement","measurement protocol","latency","jitter","bandwidth","packet-loss"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8802","errata_url":null}
