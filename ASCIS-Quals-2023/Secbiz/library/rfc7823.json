Such performance criteria can include\r\nlatency, jitter, and loss or other indications such as the\r\nconformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic\r\nload.  This specification describes how a path computation function\r\nmay use network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF\r\nand IS-IS TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this\r\ndocument) to perform such path selections.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["Traffic Engineering","Path Computation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7823","errata_url":null}
