The framework is based on a set of building blocks\r\nincluding OAuth 2.0 and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),\r\nthus transforming a well-known and widely used authorization solution\r\ninto a form suitable for IoT devices.  Existing specifications are\r\nused where possible, but extensions are added and profiles are\r\ndefined to better serve the IoT use cases.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["CoAP","OAuth 2.0","Access Control","Authorization","Internet of Things"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9200","errata_url":null}
