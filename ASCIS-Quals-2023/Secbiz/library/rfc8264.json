This document defines a framework enabling\r\napplication protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and\r\ncomparison of internationalized strings (\"PRECIS\") in a way that\r\ndepends on the properties of Unicode code points and thus is more\r\nagile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this\r\nframework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of\r\ninternationalized strings than the previous framework, known as\r\nStringprep (RFC 3454).
