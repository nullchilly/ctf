A possible use case is to make it possible for a \\%low-end \\%hand-\r\nheld terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,\r\nsomething that may consume large amounts of memory and processing\r\npower.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for\r\nvideo as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is\r\ntransmitted.
