Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently\r\napplicable security services for transaction confidentiality,\r\nauthenticity\/integrity and non-repudiability of origin.\r\n\r\nThe protocol emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key\r\nmanagement mechanisms, security policies and cryptographic algorithms\r\nby supporting option negotiation between parties for each\r\ntransaction.","pub_date":"July 1999","keywords":["WWW","world wide web","http","authentication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC2660","errata_url":null}
