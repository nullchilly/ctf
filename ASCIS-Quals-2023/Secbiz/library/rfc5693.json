Such\r\napplications often transfer large amounts of data through connections\r\nestablished between nodes distributed across the Internet with little\r\nknowledge of the underlying network topology.  Some applications are\r\nso designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger\r\nset with which to exchange data.  Absent any topology information\r\nguiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information\r\nobtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often\r\nmake less than desirable choices.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses issues related to an information-sharing\r\nservice that enables applications to perform better-than-random peer\r\nselection.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2009","keywords":["peer-to-peer","p2p"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5693","errata_url":null}
