This document\r\ndescribes extensions to the PMIPv6 protocol that are required to\r\nsupport network-based flow mobility over multiple physical\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5213.  The extensions described in this\r\ndocument consist of the operations performed by the local mobility\r\nanchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned\r\nto the different interfaces of the mobile node, as well as how the\r\nforwarding policies are handled by the network to ensure consistent\r\nflow mobility management.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["flow mobility","NB-IFOM","PMIPv6","FMI","FMA"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5213"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7864","errata_url":null}
