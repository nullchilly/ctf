      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol that is
designed to be robust and efficient both in networks using prefix-based
routing and in networks using flat routing ("mesh networks"), and both in
relatively stable wired networks and in highly dynamic wireless networks.
This document describes the Babel routing protocol and obsoletes

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-1">The main property that makes Babel suitable for unstable networks is
that, unlike naive distance-vector routing protocols <xref target="RFC2453" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RIP"/>,
it strongly limits the frequency and duration of routing pathologies such
as routing loops and black-holes during reconvergence.  Even after
a mobility event is detected, a Babel network usually remains loop-free.
Babel then quickly reconverges to a configuration that preserves the
loop-freedom and connectedness of the network, but is not necessarily
optimal; in many cases, this operation requires no packet exchanges at
all.  Babel then slowly converges, in a time on the scale of minutes, to
an optimal configuration.  This is achieved by using sequenced routes,
a technique pioneered by Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector routing
<xref target="DSDV" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DSDV"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">More precisely, Babel has the following properties:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1.1-3">
          <li pn="section-1.1-3.1">when every prefix is originated by at most one router, Babel never
  suffers from routing loops;</li>
          <li pn="section-1.1-3.2">when a single prefix is originated by multiple routers, Babel may
  occasionally create a transient routing loop for this particular prefix;
  this loop disappears in time proportional to the loop's diameter, and never
  again (up to an arbitrary garbage-collection (GC) time) will the routers
  involved participate in a routing loop for the same prefix;</li>
          <li pn="section-1.1-3.3">assuming bounded packet loss rates, any routing black-holes that
  may appear after a mobility event are corrected in a time at most
  proportional to the network's diameter.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-4">Babel has provisions for link quality estimation and for fairly
arbitrary metrics.  When configured suitably, Babel can implement
shortest-path routing, or it may use a metric based, for example, on
measured packet loss.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-5">Babel nodes will successfully establish an association even when they
are configured with different parameters.  For example, a mobile node that
is low on battery may choose to use larger time constants (hello and update
intervals, etc.) than a node that has access to wall power.  Conversely, a
node that detects high levels of mobility may choose to use smaller time
constants.  The ability to build such heterogeneous networks makes Babel
particularly adapted to the unmanaged or wireless environment.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-6">Finally, Babel is a hybrid routing protocol, in the sense that it can
carry routes for multiple network-layer protocols (IPv4 and IPv6),
regardless of which protocol the Babel packets are themselves being
carried over.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-limitations">Limitations</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-1">Babel has two limitations that make it unsuitable for use in some
environments.  First, Babel relies on periodic routing table updates
rather than using a reliable transport; hence, in large, stable networks
it generates more traffic than protocols that only send updates when the
network topology changes.  In such networks, protocols such as OSPF <xref target="RFC2328" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OSPF"/>, IS-IS <xref target="IS-IS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IS-IS"/>, or the Enhanced Interior
Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) <xref target="EIGRP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EIGRP"/> might be more
suitable.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-2">Second, unless the second algorithm described in <xref target="hold-time" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5.4"/>
is implemented, Babel does impose a hold time when a prefix is retracted.
While this hold time does not apply to the exact prefix being retracted,
and hence does not prevent fast reconvergence should it become available
again, it does apply to any shorter prefix that covers it.  This may make
those implementations of Babel that do not implement the optional
algorithm described in <xref target="hold-time" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5.4"/> unsuitable for use in
networks that implement automatic prefix aggregation.</t>

Bellman-Ford algorithm, just like the venerable RIP <xref target="RFC2453" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RIP"/>,
but includes a number of refinements that either prevent loop formation
altogether, or ensure that a loop disappears in a timely manner and
doesn't form again.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">Conceptually, Bellman-Ford is executed in parallel for every source of
routing information (destination of data traffic).  In the following

abstract value known as the cost of the link from A to B, written
C(A, B).  Given a route between any two (not necessarily
neighbouring) nodes, the metric of the route is the sum of the costs of
all the links along the route.  The goal of the routing algorithm is to
compute, for every source S, the tree of routes of lowest metric to S.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-2">Periodically, every node B sends to all of its neighbours a route
update, a message containing D(B).  When a neighbour A of B receives the
route update, it checks whether B is its selected next hop; if that is the
case, then NH(A) is set to B, and D(A) is set to C(A, B) + D(B).  If that
is not the case, then A compares C(A, B) + D(B) to its current value of
D(A).  If that value is smaller, meaning that the received update
advertises a route that is better than the currently selected route, then
NH(A) is set to B, and D(A) is set to C(A, B) + D(B).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-3">A number of refinements to this algorithm are possible, and are used by
Babel.  In particular, convergence speed may be increased by sending
unscheduled "triggered updates" whenever a major change in the topology is
detected, in addition to the regular, scheduled updates.  Additionally,
a node may maintain a number of alternate routes, which are being
advertised by neighbours other than its selected neighbour, and which can
be used immediately if the selected route were to fail.</t>

a metric equal to 3, and then advertises a new route with metric 3.  This
process of nodes changing selected neighbours and increasing their metric
continues until the advertised metric reaches "infinity", a value larger
than all the metrics that the routing protocol is able to carry.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-feasibility-conditions">Feasibility Conditions</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-1">Bellman-Ford is a very robust algorithm: its convergence properties
are preserved when routers delay route acquisition or when they
discard some updates.  Babel routers discard received route
announcements unless they can prove that accepting them cannot
possibly cause a routing loop.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-2">More formally, we define a condition over route announcements, known as
the "feasibility condition", that guarantees the absence of routing loops
whenever all routers ignore route updates that do not satisfy the
feasibility condition.  In effect, this makes Bellman-Ford into a family
of routing algorithms, parameterised by the feasibility condition.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-3">Many different feasibility conditions are possible.  For example, BGP
can be modelled as being a distance-vector protocol with a (rather
drastic) feasibility condition: a routing update is only accepted when the
receiving node's AS number is not included in the update's AS_PATH
attribute (note that BGP's feasibility condition does not ensure the
absence of transient "micro-loops" during reconvergence).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-4">Another simple feasibility condition, used in the Destination-Sequenced
Distance-Vector (DSDV) routing protocol <xref target="DSDV" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DSDV"/> and in the
Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol <xref target="RFC3561" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3561"/>,
stems from the following observation: a routing loop can only arise after
a router has switched to a route with a larger metric than the route that
it had previously selected.  Hence, one may define that a route is
feasible when its metric at the local node would be no larger than
the metric of the currently selected route, i.e., an announcement carrying
a metric D(B) is accepted by A when C(A, B) + D(B) &lt;= D(A).  If all
routers obey this constraint, then the metric at every router is
nonincreasing, and the following invariant is always preserved: if A has
selected B as its next hop, then D(B) &lt; D(A), which implies that the
forwarding graph is loop-free.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-5">Babel uses a slightly more refined feasibility condition, derived from
EIGRP <xref target="DUAL" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DUAL"/>.  Given a router A, define the feasibility
distance of A, written FD(A), as the smallest metric that A has ever
advertised for S to any of its neighbours.  An update sent by a neighbour
B of A is feasible when the metric D(B) advertised by B is strictly
smaller than A's feasibility distance, i.e., when D(B) &lt; FD(A).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-6">It is easy to see that this latter condition is no more restrictive than
DSDV-feasibility.  Suppose that node A obeys DSDV-feasibility; then D(A) is
nonincreasing, hence at all times D(A) &lt;= FD(A).  Suppose now that
A receives a DSDV-feasible update that advertises a metric D(B).  Since the
update is DSDV-feasible, C(A, B) + D(B) &lt;= D(A), hence D(B) &lt; D(A),
and since D(A) &lt;= FD(A), D(B) &lt; FD(A).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-7">To see that it is strictly less restrictive, consider the following
diagram, where A has selected the route through B, and D(A) = FD(A) = 2.
Since D(C) = 1 &lt; FD(A), the alternate route through C is feasible for A,
although its metric C(A, C) + D(C) = 5 is larger than that of the
currently selected route:

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-9">To show that this feasibility condition still guarantees loop-freedom,
recall that at the time when A accepts an update from B, the metric D(B)
announced by B is no smaller than FD(B); since it is smaller than FD(A),
at that point in time FD(B) &lt; FD(A).  Since this property is preserved
when A sends updates and also when it picks a different next hop, it
remains true at all times, which ensures that the forwarding graph has no
loops.</t>

all the routers in the starving subtree (the "active" phase of EIGRP).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.5-6">Babel reacts to starvation in a less drastic manner, by using sequenced
routes, a technique introduced by DSDV and adopted by AODV.  In addition to
a metric, every route carries a sequence number, a nondecreasing integer
that is propagated unchanged through the network and is only ever
incremented by the source; a pair (s, m), where s is a sequence number and
m a metric, is called a distance.</t>

feasibility distance maintained by the receiving node, or it is equally
recent and the metric is strictly smaller.  More formally, if FD(A) =

when either s' &gt; s, or s = s' and m' &lt; m.</t>

they are not used in route selection: a node ignores the sequence number
when selecting the best route to a given destination

route oscillation while a sequence number propagates through the network,

suffering from a potentially spurious starvation, it sends an explicit
request to the source for a new sequence number.  This request is forwarded
hop by hop to the source, with no regard to the feasibility condition.
Upon receiving the request, the source increases its sequence number and

route to the source; hence, in the absence of packet loss, at least one

acknowledgment request; the update is resent until all neighbours have
acknowledged the packet, up to some number of times.  If the number of
neighbours is large, however, requesting acknowledgments from all of them
might cause a non-negligible amount of network traffic; in that case, it
may be preferable to simply repeat the update some reasonable number of

such as when there is a minor fluctuation in a route's metric, when the
selected next hop changes without inducing a significant change to the

updates; hence, some care has been given to encoding them efficiently.
The data conceptually contained in an update (<xref target="route-maintenance" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5"/>)
is split into three pieces:
</t>

        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-3">
In addition to the above, an Update TLV can omit a prefix of the prefix
being announced, which is then extracted from the preceding Update TLV
in the same address family (IPv4 or IPv6).  Finally, as a special
optimisation for the case when a router-id coincides with the interface-id
part of an IPv6 address, the Router-Id TLV itself may be omitted, and the
router-id is derived from the low-order bits of the advertised prefix
(<xref target="update" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.6.9"/>).</t>

mandatory sub-TLV or for any other reason.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">As defined in this document, Babel is a completely insecure protocol.
Without additional security mechanisms, Babel trusts any information it
receives in plaintext UDP datagrams and acts on it.  An attacker that is
present on the local network can impact Babel operation in a variety of
ways; for example they can:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-6-2">
        <li pn="section-6-2.1">spoof a Babel packet, and redirect traffic by announcing a route with
a smaller metric, a larger sequence number, or a longer prefix;</li>
        <li pn="section-6-2.2">spoof a malformed packet, which could cause an insufficiently robust
implementation to crash or interfere with the rest of the network;</li>
        <li pn="section-6-2.3">replay a previously captured Babel packet, which could cause traffic to
be redirected, black-holed, or otherwise interfere with the network.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-3">
When carried over IPv6, Babel packets are ignored unless they are sent
from a link-local IPv6 address; since routers don't forward link-local
IPv6 packets, this mitigates the attacks outlined above by restricting
them to on-link attackers.  No such natural protection exists when Babel
packets are carried over IPv4, which is one of the reasons why it is
recommended to deploy Babel over IPv6
(<xref target="transmission-reception" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-4">It is usually difficult to ensure that packets arriving at a Babel node
are trusted, even in the case where the local link is believed to be
secure.  For that reason, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that all Babel traffic be
protected by an application-layer cryptographic protocol.  There are
currently two suitable mechanisms, which implement different trade-offs
between implementation simplicity and security:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-6-5">
        <li pn="section-6-5.1">Babel over DTLS <xref target="RFC8968" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8968"/> runs the majority of Babel
traffic over DTLS and leverages DTLS to authenticate nodes and provide
confidentiality and integrity protection;</li>
        <li pn="section-6-5.2">MAC authentication <xref target="RFC8967" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8967"/> appends a message
authentication code (MAC) to every Babel packet to prove that it
originated at a node that knows a shared secret, and includes sufficient
additional information to prove that the packet is fresh (not replayed).</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-6">
Both mechanisms enable nodes to ignore packets generated by attackers
without the proper credentials.  They also ensure integrity of messages
and prevent message replay.  While Babel-DTLS supports asymmetric keying
and ensures confidentiality, Babel-MAC has a much more limited scope (see
Sections <xref target="RFC8967" section="1.1" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-1.1" derivedContent="RFC8967"/>, 
<xref target="RFC8967" section="1.2" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-1.2" derivedContent="RFC8967"/>, and 
<xref target="RFC8967" section="7" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-7" derivedContent="RFC8967"/> of 
<xref target="RFC8967" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8967"/>).  Since Babel-MAC
is simpler and more lightweight, it is recommended in preference to
Babel-DTLS in deployments where its limitations are acceptable, i.e., when
symmetric keying is sufficient and where the routing information is not
considered confidential.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-7">Every implementation of Babel <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> implement BABEL-MAC.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-8">One should be aware that the information that a mobile Babel node
announces to the whole routing domain is sufficient to determine the mobile
node's physical location with reasonable precision, which might cause
privacy concerns even if the control traffic is protected from
unauthenticated attackers by a cryptographic mechanism such as Babel-DTLS.
This issue may be mitigated somewhat by using randomly chosen router-ids
and randomly chosen IP addresses, and changing them often enough.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-a.1-1">For each neighbour, a node maintains two sets of Hello history, one for
each kind of Hello, and an expected sequence number, one for Multicast and
one for Unicast Hellos.  Each Hello history is a vector of 16 bits, where
a 1 value represents a received Hello, and a 0 value a missed Hello.  For
each kind of Hello, the expected sequence number, written ne, is the
sequence number that is expected to be carried by the next received Hello
from this neighbour.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-a.1-2">Whenever it receives a Hello packet of a given kind from a neighbour,
a node compares the received sequence number nr for that kind of Hello
with its expected sequence number ne.  Depending on the outcome of this
comparison, one of the following actions is taken:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-a.1-3">
          <li pn="section-a.1-3.1">if the two differ by more than 16 (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>), then the sending
  node has probably rebooted and lost its sequence number; the whole
  associated neighbour table entry is flushed and a new one is created;</li>
          <li pn="section-a.1-3.2">otherwise, if the received nr is smaller (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>) than the
  expected sequence number ne, then the sending node has increased its
  Hello interval without our noticing; the receiving node removes the last
  (ne - nr) entries from this neighbour's Hello history (we "undo
  history");</li>
          <li pn="section-a.1-3.3">otherwise, if nr is larger (modulo 2<sup>16</sup>) than ne, then the sending
  node has decreased its Hello interval, and some Hellos were lost; the
  receiving node adds (nr - ne) 0 bits to the Hello history (we
  "fast-forward").</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-a.1-4">
The receiving node then appends a 1 bit to the Hello history and sets ne
to (nr + 1).  If the Interval field of the received Hello is not zero, it
resets the neighbour's hello timer to 1.5 times the advertised Interval
(the extra margin allows for delay due to jitter).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-a.1-5">Whenever either hello timer associated with a neighbour expires, the
local node adds a 0 bit to the corresponding Hello history, and increments
the expected Hello number.  If both Hello histories are empty (they
contain 0 bits only), the neighbour entry is flushed; otherwise, the
relevant hello timer is reset to the value advertised in the last Hello of
that kind received from this neighbour (no extra margin is necessary in
this case, since jitter was already taken into account when computing the
timeout that has just expired).</t>

of hop-count routing in networks that use wireless links for transit tends

protocol designed to support wireless links must perform some form of
link quality estimation.</t>

default, the IEEE 802.11 MAC performs Automatic Repeat Query (ARQ)

which a node selects a single route among the routes that it has available

that only ever chooses feasible routes with a finite metric will yield
a set of loop-free routes; however, in the presence of continuously
variable metrics such as ETX (<xref target="etx" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.2.2"/>), a naive route
selection procedure might lead to persistent oscillations.  Such
oscillations can be limited or avoided altogether by implementing
hysteresis within the route selection algorithm, i.e., by making the route
selection algorithm sensitive to a route's history.  Any reasonable
hysteresis algorithm should yield good results; the following algorithm

influence on the time needed to reconverge after an outage: in practice,
it only has a significant effect on the time needed to acquire new routes

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-1">Route filtering is a procedure where an instance of a routing protocol
either discards some of the routes announced by its neighbours or learns
them with a metric that is higher than what would be expected.  Like all
distance-vector protocols, Babel has the ability to apply arbitrary
filtering to the routes it learns, and implementations of Babel that apply
different sets of filtering rules will interoperate without causing
routing loops.  The protocol's ability to perform route filtering is
a consequence of the latitude given in <xref target="metric-computation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5.2"/>:
Babel can use any metric that is strictly monotonic, including one that
assigns an infinite metric to a selected subset of routes.  (See also
<xref target="handling-requests" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.8.1"/>, where requests for nonexistent routes
are treated in the same way as requests for routes with infinite metric.)</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2">It is not in general correct to learn a route with a metric smaller
than the one it was announced with, or to replace a route's destination
prefix with a more specific (longer) one.  Doing either of these may cause
persistent routing loops.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-3">Route filtering is a useful tool, since it allows fine-grained tuning
of the routing decisions made by the routing protocol.  Accordingly, some
implementations of Babel implement a rich configuration language that
allows applying filtering to sets of routes defined, for example, by
incoming interface and destination prefix.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-4">In order to limit the consequences of misconfiguration, Babel
implementations provide a reasonable set of default filtering rules even
when they don't allow configuration of filtering by the user.  At
a minimum, they discard routes with a destination prefix in fe80::/64,
ff00::/8, 127.0.0.1/32, 0.0.0.0/32, and 224.0.0.0/8.</t>

choosing a particular encoding.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-4">The version number in the Babel header should only be increased if the
new version is not backwards compatible with the original protocol.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-5">In many cases, an extension could be implemented either by defining
a new TLV or by adding a new sub-TLV to an existing TLV.  For example, an
extension whose purpose is to attach additional data to route updates can
be implemented either by creating a new "enriched" Update TLV, by adding
a nonmandatory sub-TLV to the Update TLV, or by adding a mandatory
sub-TLV.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-6">The various encodings are treated differently by implementations that
do not understand the extension.  In the case of a new TLV or of a sub-TLV
with the mandatory bit set, the whole TLV is ignored by implementations
that do not implement the extension, while in the case of a nonmandatory
sub-TLV, the TLV is parsed and acted upon, and only the unknown sub-TLV is
silently ignored.  Therefore, a nonmandatory sub-TLV should be used by
extensions that extend the Update in a compatible manner (the extension
data may be silently ignored), while a mandatory sub-TLV or a new TLV must
be used by extensions that make incompatible extensions to the meaning of
the TLV (the whole TLV must be thrown away if the extension data is not
understood).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-7">Experience shows that the need for additional data tends to crop up in
the most unexpected places.  Hence, it is recommended that extensions that
define new TLVs should make them self-terminating and allow attaching
sub-TLVs to them.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-8">Adding a new AE is essentially equivalent to adding a new TLV: Update
TLVs with an unknown AE are ignored, just like unknown TLVs.  However,
adding a new AE is more involved than adding a new TLV, since it creates
a new set of compression state.  Additionally, since the Next Hop TLV
creates state specific to a given address family, as opposed to a given
AE, a new AE for a previously defined address family must not be used in
the Next Hop TLV if backwards compatibility is required.  A similar issue
arises with Update TLVs with unknown AEs establishing a new router-id (due
to the Router-Id flag being set).  Therefore, defining new AEs must be
done with care if compatibility with unextended implementations is
required.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-9">The packet trailer is intended to carry cryptographic signatures that
only cover the packet body; storing the cryptographic signatures in the
packet trailer avoids clearing the signature before computing a hash of
the packet body, and makes it possible to check a cryptographic signature
before running the full, stateful TLV parser.  Hence, only TLVs that don't
need to be protected by cryptographic security protocols should be allowed
in the packet trailer.  Any such TLVs should be easy to parse and, in
particular, should not require stateful parsing.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.e-1">Babel is a fairly economic protocol.  Updates take between 12 and 40
octets per destination, depending on the address family and how successful
compression is; in a dual-stack flat network, an average of less than 24
octets per update is typical.  The route table occupies about 35 octets
per IPv6 entry.  To put these values into perspective, a single full-size
Ethernet frame can carry some 65 route updates, and a megabyte of memory
can contain a 20,000-entry route table and the associated source table.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.e-2">Babel is also a reasonably simple protocol.  One complete implementation
consists of less than 12,000 lines of C code, and it compiles to less
than 120 KB of text on a 32-bit CISC architecture; about half of this
figure is due to protocol extensions and user-interface code.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.e-3">Nonetheless, in some very constrained environments, such as PDAs,
microwave ovens, or abacuses, it may be desirable to have subset
implementations of the protocol.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.e-4">There are many different definitions of a stub router, but for the
needs of this section, a stub implementation of Babel is one that announces
one or more directly attached prefixes into a Babel network but doesn't
re-announce any routes that it has learnt from its neighbours, and always
prefers the direct route to a directly attached prefix to a route learnt
over the Babel protocol, even when the prefixes are the same.  It may
either maintain a full routing table or simply select a default gateway
through any one of its neighbours that announces a default route.  Since
a stub implementation never forwards packets except from or to a directly
attached link, it cannot possibly participate in a routing loop, and hence
it need not evaluate the feasibility condition or maintain a source
table.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.e-5">No matter how primitive, a stub implementation must parse sub-TLVs
attached to any TLVs that it understands and check the mandatory bit.
It must answer acknowledgment requests and must participate in the

routes that it announces, and it should be able to reply to route
requests.</t>

Unicast Hellos (<xref target="reverse-reachability" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.4.1"/>), and an
implementation of RFC 6126 will misinterpret a Unicast Hello for
a Multicast one; since the sequence number space of Unicast Hellos is
distinct from the sequence number space of Multicast Hellos, sending a Unicast
Hello to an implementation of RFC 6126 will confuse its link quality
estimator.  Second, RFC 6126 did not define unscheduled Hellos, and an
implementation of RFC 6126 will mis-parse Hellos with an interval equal to
0.  Finally, RFC 7557 did not define mandatory sub-TLVs 
(<xref target="sub-tlv-format" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.4"/>), and thus an implementation of RFCs 6126 and

sub-TLV; depending on the sub-TLV, this might cause routing pathologies.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.f-3">An implementation of this specification that never sends Unicast or
