It is a\r\nstream cipher algorithm with a 128-bit key and 64-bit initialization\r\nvector (IV).  The method was published in 2003 and has been subject to\r\npublic security and performance revision.  Its high performance makes\r\nit particularly suited for the use with Internet protocols where large\r\namounts of data have to be processed.
