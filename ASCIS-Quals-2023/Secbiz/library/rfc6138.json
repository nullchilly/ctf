If this mechanism is applied to broadcast\r\nlinks that have more than one LDP peer, the metric increase\r\nprocedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not to an\r\nindividual peer.  When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network,\r\nthis can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on\r\nthat network.  This document describes a mechanism to address that\r\nuse-case without dropping traffic.  The mechanism does not introduce\r\nany protocol message changes.  This document is not an Internet Standards \r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5443"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6138","errata_url":null}
