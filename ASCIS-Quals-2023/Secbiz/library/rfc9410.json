It extends the\r\nability to use the Reason header field as an option for conveying an\r\nerror associated with an Identity header field to the upstream\r\nauthentication service when local policy dictates that the call\r\nshould continue in the presence of a verification failure. This\r\ndocument also defines procedures that enable a failure reason to be\r\nmapped to a specific Identity header field for scenarios that use\r\nmultiple Identity header fields, where some may have errors and\r\nothers may not. The handling of those situations is also defined.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":["Identity","multiple errors","passport","reason header field"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9410","errata_url":null}
