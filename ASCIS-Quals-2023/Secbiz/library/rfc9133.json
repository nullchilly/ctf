The characterization of these\r\nfiltering rules is conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time\r\n(i.e., no mitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel\r\nprotocol.","pub_date":"September 2021","keywords":["Mitigation","Automation","Filtering","Protective Networking","Protected Networks","Security","Anti-DDoS","Reactive","Collaborative Networking","Collaborative Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9133","errata_url":null}
