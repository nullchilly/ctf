It\r\ndescribes the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  SCTP is\r\ndesigned to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)\r\nsignaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nSCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a\r\nconnectionless packet network such as IP.  It offers the following\r\nservices to its users:\r\n\r\n--  acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,\r\n\r\n--  data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,\r\n\r\n--  sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with\r\nan option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user\r\nmessages,\r\n\r\n--  optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP\r\npacket, and\r\n\r\n--  network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing\r\nat either or both ends of an association.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior\r\nand resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.
