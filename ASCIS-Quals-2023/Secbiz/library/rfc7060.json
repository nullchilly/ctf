The LDP base specification allows for the\r\ncase where the two endpoints of an LDP session are not directly\r\nconnected; such a session is known as a \"Targeted LDP\" session.\r\nThis document provides the specification for using the LDP Multipoint\r\nExtensions over a Targeted LDP session.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7060","errata_url":null}
