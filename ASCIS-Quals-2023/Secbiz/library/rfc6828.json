Splicing is commonly used for insertion of local advertisements by\r\ncable operators, whereby national advertisement content is replaced with a\r\nlocal advertisement.\r\n\r\nThis memo describes some use cases for content splicing and a set of\r\nrequirements for splicing content delivered by RTP.  It provides\r\nconcrete guidelines for how an RTP mixer can be used to handle\r\ncontent splicing.
