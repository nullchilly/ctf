However, this process\r\nis not always followed by IETF participants.  Regardless of the cause\r\nor motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules can delay or\r\neven derail completion of IETF specifications.  This document\r\ndescribes some strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR\r\ndisclosure rules.  These strategies are primarily intended for use by\r\narea directors, working group chairs, and working group secretaries.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8717"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6702","errata_url":null}
