The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely\r\nimplemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio\r\nheadsets, and many other devices.  The low-power version of Bluetooth\r\nis a specification that enables the use of this air interface with\r\ndevices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low-power\r\nvariant of Bluetooth has been standardized since revision 4.0\r\nof the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is\r\nrequired for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported\r\nover Bluetooth low energy using IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal\r\nArea Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["Bluetooth Low Energy","6lowpan","IPv6","Low power"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7668","errata_url":null}
