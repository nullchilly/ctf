It updates the definition of standard-formed packets to\r\ninclude IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimal IP packet,\r\nand augments distinguishing aspects, referred to as Type-P, for test\r\npackets in RFC 2330.  This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 coexistence\r\ncan challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM framework.\r\nExample use cases include, but are not limited to, IPv4-IPv6\r\ntranslation, NAT, and protocol encapsulation.  IPv6 header\r\ncompression and use of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area Networks\r\n(6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded from the standard-formed packet\r\nevaluation.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["Measurement","Methodology","Standard-Formed Packet","Type-P","Minimal Packet","IPv6 Transition"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2330"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8468","errata_url":null}
