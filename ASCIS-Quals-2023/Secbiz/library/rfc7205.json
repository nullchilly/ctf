A number of\r\ntechniques for handling audio and video streams are used to create\r\nthis experience.  When these techniques are not similar,\r\ninteroperability between different systems is difficult at best, and\r\noften not possible.  Conveying information about the relationships\r\nbetween multiple streams of media would enable senders and receivers\r\nto make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This\r\nmemo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending\r\nmultiple streams in a telepresence conference.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7205","errata_url":null}
