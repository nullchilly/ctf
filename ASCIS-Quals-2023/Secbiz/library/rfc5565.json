One kind of\r\nsingle-protocol network can parse only IPv4 packets and can process\r\nonly IPv4 routing information; another kind can parse only IPv6\r\npackets and can process only IPv6 routing information.  It is\r\nnevertheless required that either kind of single-protocol network be\r\nable to provide transit service for the \"other\" protocol.  This is\r\ndone by passing the \"other kind\" of routing information from one edge\r\nof the single-protocol network to the other, and by tunneling the\r\n\"other kind\" of data packet from one edge to the other.  The tunnels\r\nare known as \"softwires\".  This framework document explains how the\r\nrouting information and the data packets of one protocol are passed\r\nthrough a single-protocol network of the other protocol.  The\r\ndocument is careful to specify when this can be done with existing\r\ntechnology and when it requires the development of new or modified\r\ntechnology.
