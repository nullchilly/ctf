It is, however, possible that a packet is either\r\nlost or that multiple copies arrive.\r\n\r\nIn earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined.  This metric\r\nquantifies the case where a packet that is sent does not arrive at\r\nits destination within a reasonable time.  In this memo, a metric for\r\nanother case is defined: a packet is sent, but multiple copies\r\narrive.  The document also discusses streams and methods to summarize\r\nthe results of streams.
