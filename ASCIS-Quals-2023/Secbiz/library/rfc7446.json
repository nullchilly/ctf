The purpose of the information described\r\nin this model is to facilitate constrained optical path computation in\r\nWSONs.  This model takes into account compatibility constraints\r\nbetween WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not\r\ninclude constraints due to optical impairments.  Aspects of this\r\ninformation that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a\r\nGMPLS control plane are discussed.","pub_date":"February 2015","keywords":["WSON","RWA"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7446","errata_url":null}
