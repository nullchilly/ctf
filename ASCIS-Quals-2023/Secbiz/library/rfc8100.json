Many network providers operate\r\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Treatment Aggregates for\r\ntraffic marked with different Diffserv Per-Hop Behaviors and use MPLS\r\nfor interconnection with other networks.  This document offers a\r\nsimple interconnection approach that may simplify operation of\r\nDiffserv for network interconnection among providers that use MPLS\r\nand apply the Short Pipe Model.  While motivated by the requirements\r\nof MPLS network operators that use Short Pipe Model tunnels, this\r\ndocument is applicable to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["Diffserv","Interconnection","PHB","Treatment Aggregate","MPLS Short Pipe"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8100","errata_url":null}
