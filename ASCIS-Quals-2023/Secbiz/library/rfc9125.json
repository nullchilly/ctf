One data center typically has more than one gateway\r\nfor commercial, load-balancing, and resiliency reasons.  Other sites,\r\nsuch as access networks, also need to be connected across backbone\r\nnetworks through gateways.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation\r\nattribute to allow data center gateway routers to advertise routes to\r\nthe prefixes reachable in the site, including advertising them on\r\nbehalf of other gateways at the same site.  This allows segment\r\nrouting to be used to identify multiple paths across the Internet or\r\nbackbone network between different gateways.  The paths can be\r\nselected for load-balancing, resilience, and quality purposes.","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":["SR","GW","BGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9125","errata_url":null}
