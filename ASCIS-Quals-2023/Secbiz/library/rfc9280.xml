      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. The model 
defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy 
definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group 
(RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval 
Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals. Second, policy 
implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production 
Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration
Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).  In addition, various 
responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed alone
or in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting Editor 
(RSCE), and IETF LLC. Finally, this document establishes the Editorial 
Stream for publication of future policy definition documents produced 
through the processes defined herein.</t>

8729, and 8730.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Request for Comments (RFC) Series is the archival series
dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications,
including general contributions from the Internet research and
engineering community as well as standards documents. RFCs are 
available free of charge to anyone via the Internet. As described
in <xref target="RFC8700" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8700"/>, RFCs have been published continually since 1969.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">RFCs are generated and approved by multiple document streams. 
Whereas the stream approving body <xref target="RFC8729" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8729"/> for each stream is 
responsible for the content of that stream, the RFC Editor function 
is responsible for the production and distribution of all RFCs. 
The four existing streams are described in <xref target="RFC8729" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8729"/>. This 
document adds a fifth stream, the Editorial Stream, for publication
of policies governing the RFC Series as a whole.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The overall framework for the RFC Series and the RFC Editor
function is described in <xref target="RFC8729" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8729"/> and is updated by this 
document, which defines version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. 
Under this version, various responsibilities of the RFC Editor 
function are performed alone or in combination by the RFC Series
Working Group (RSWG), RFC Series Advisory Board (RSAB), RFC
Production Center (RPC), RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE), and 
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) <xref target="RFC8711" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8711"/>, 
which collectively comprise the RFC Editor function. The intent 
is to ensure sustainable maintenance and support of the RFC Series 
based on the principles of expert implementation, clear management 
and direction, and appropriate community input <xref target="RFC8729" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8729"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC8728" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8728"/> by defining version 3 
of the RFC Editor Model. This document updates <xref target="RFC7841" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7841"/> 
by defining boilerplate text for the Editorial Stream. This 
document updates <xref target="RFC8729" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8729"/> by replacing the RFC Editor role
with the RSWG, RSAB, and RSCE. This document updates <xref target="RFC8730" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8730"/>
by removing the dependency on certain policies specified by the
IAB and RFC Series Editor (RSE). More detailed information about changes from 
version 2 of the RFC Editor Model can be found in <xref target="changes" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9"/>.</t>

Group (RSWG) is an open working group independent of the IETF that 
generates policy proposals. Second, the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB) 
is an appointed body that approves such proposals for publication 
in the Editorial Stream. The RSAB includes representatives of the

        <li pn="section-2-4.2">The RSAB considers those proposals and either approves them or returns 
them to the RSWG, which may make further changes or remove them from
further consideration.</li>
        <li pn="section-2-4.3">If approved, such proposals are published as RFCs in the Editorial
Stream and thus define the policies to be followed by the RSWG, RSAB,
RSCE, and RPC.</li>
        <li pn="section-2-4.4">The RSCE provides expert advice to the RPC and RSAB on how to implement
established policies on an ongoing and operational basis, which can include
raising issues or initiating proposed policy changes within the RSWG.</li>
        <li pn="section-2-4.5">The RPC implements the policies defined by the Editorial Stream in its
day-to-day editing and publication of RFCs from all of the streams.</li>
        <li pn="section-2-4.6">If issues arise with the implementation of particular policies, the RPC
brings those issues to the RSAB, which interprets the policies and provides
interim guidance to the RPC, informing the RSWG of those interpretations.</li>

defined in this document. As described in Sections <xref target="workflow" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.2.2"/> and <xref target="cfc" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.2.3"/>,
proposals that might have a detrimental effect on these properties
should receive heightened scrutiny during RSWG discussion and RSAB 
review. The purpose of this scrutiny is to ensure that all changes are 
deliberate and that the consequences of a proposal, as far as they can be
identified, have been carefully considered.</t>

have changed significantly over the years. Most recently, in 2009,
<xref target="RFC5620" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5620"/> defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1), and in 2012,
<xref target="RFC6635" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6635"/> defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), which was then
modified slightly in 2020 by <xref target="RFC8728" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8728"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-2">However, the community experienced several problems with versions 1 
and 2, including a lack of transparency, a lack of avenues

      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-3">To address these problems, in 2020, the IAB formed the RFC Editor 
Future Development Program to conduct a community discussion and 
consensus process for the further evolution of the RFC Editor Model. 
Under the auspices of this Program, the community considered changes 
that would increase transparency and community input regarding the 
definition of policies for the RFC Series as a whole, while at 
the same time ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, 
maintaining the quality and timely publication of RFCs, 
ensuring document accessibility, and clarifying lines of 
authority and responsibility.</t>

or, more precisely, the RFC Editor function, are now performed

responsibilities of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) as a person or
role (contrasted with the overall RFC Editor function) are now
split or shared among the RSWG, RSAB, RSCE, RPC, and IETF LLC (alone
or in combination). More specifically, the responsibilities of
the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) under version 3 of the RFC
Editor Model differ in many ways from the responsibilities of the
RFC Series Editor under version 2 of the RFC Editor Model. In general,
references in existing documents to the RSE can be taken as

Under version 2 of the RFC Editor Model, the IAB delegated some
of its authority to the RFC Series Oversight Committee (see <xref target="rsoc" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 9.5"/>).
Under version 3 of the RFC Editor Model, authority for policy definition
resides with the RSWG as an independent venue for work by members
of the community (with approval of policy proposals being the
responsibility of the RSAB, which represents the streams and includes
the RSCE), whereas authority for policy implementation resides with
the IETF LLC.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this RFC is to document and describe the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0). It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF LLC Board.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.</t>

              <t indent="0">The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references to the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.</t>
