Slow start can\r\novershoot the ideal send rate in many cases, causing high packet loss\r\nand poor performance. HyStart++ uses increase in round-trip delay as\r\na heuristic to find an exit point before possible overshoot. It also\r\nadds a mitigation to prevent jitter from causing premature slow start\r\nexit.","pub_date":"May 2023","keywords":["TCP","congestion control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9406","errata_url":null}
