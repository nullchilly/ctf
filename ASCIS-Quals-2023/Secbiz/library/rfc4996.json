The profile, called ROHC-TCP,\r\nprovides efficient and robust compression of TCP headers, including\r\nfrequently used TCP options such as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments)\r\nand Timestamps.\r\n\r\nROHC-TCP works well when used over links with significant error rates\r\nand long round-trip times.  For many bandwidth-limited links where\r\nheader compression is essential, such characteristics are common.
