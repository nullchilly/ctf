Because customer management is a shared\r\nglobal responsibility, the Domain Name System (DNS) provides an ideal\r\nexisting infrastructure for maintaining authoritative customer\r\ninformation that must be readily, reliably, and publicly accessible.\r\n\r\nThis document describes four new DNS resource record types for\r\nencoding customer information in the DNS.  These records are intended\r\nto better facilitate high customer QoE via inter-provider cooperation\r\nand management of customer data.","pub_date":"1 April 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8567","errata_url":null}
