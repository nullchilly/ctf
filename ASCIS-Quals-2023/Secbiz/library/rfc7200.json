It allows SIP entities to\r\ndistribute load-filtering policies to other SIP entities in the\r\nnetwork.  The load-filtering policies contain rules to throttle calls\r\nfrom a specific user or based on their source or destination domain,\r\ntelephone number prefix.  The mechanism helps to prevent signaling\r\noverload and complements feedback-based SIP overload control efforts.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["SIP","Overload Control","Server","Performance"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7200","errata_url":null}
