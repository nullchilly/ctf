Kucherawy"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"12","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"SPF Update","abstract":"In 2006, the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising\r\nthe Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID: two proposed email\r\nauthentication protocols.  Both of these protocols enable one to\r\npublish, via the Domain Name System, a policy declaring which mail\r\nservers were authorized to send email on behalf of the domain name\r\nbeing queried.  There was concern that the two would conflict in some\r\nsignificant operational situations, interfering with message\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nThe IESG required all of these documents (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC\r\n4407, and RFC 4408) to be published as Experimental RFCs and\r\nrequested that the community observe deployment and operation of the\r\nprotocols over a period of two years from the date of publication to\r\ndetermine a reasonable path forward.\r\n\r\nAfter six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been\r\ncollected that the experiments thus created can be considered\r\nconcluded.  This document presents those findings.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":["SPF","Sender ID","authentication","authorization","email"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6686","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6686"}
