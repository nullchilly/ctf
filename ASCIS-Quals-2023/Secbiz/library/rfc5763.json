It describes a mechanism of transporting a fingerprint\r\nattribute in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) that identifies\r\nthe key that will be presented during the DTLS handshake.  The key\r\nexchange travels along the media path as opposed to the signaling\r\npath.  The SIP Identity mechanism can be used to protect the\r\nintegrity of the fingerprint attribute from modification by\r\nintermediate proxies.
