Developing NATs that meet this set of\r\nrequirements will greatly increase the likelihood that these\r\napplications will function properly.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"January 2007","keywords":["[--------|b]","nat","sip","udp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6888","RFC7857"],"see_also":["BCP0127"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4787","errata_url":null}
