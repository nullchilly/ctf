These\r\nBPs indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to\r\n(non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate \"Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers\"\r\n(BFERs).  A BIER-TE \"packets BitString\" therefore indicates the edges\r\nof the (loop-free) tree across which the packets are forwarded by\r\nBIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little\r\nchanges. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same\r\ndomain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER\r\n\"subdomains\" (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies,\r\nBIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore\r\noperate without depending on a routing protocol such as the \"Interior\r\nGateway Protocol\" (IGP).","pub_date":"October 2022","keywords":["BIER","BIER-TE","controller","ECMP","forwarding","traffic-engineering","multicast","pseudocode","routing","traffic-steering","tree-steering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9262","errata_url":null}
