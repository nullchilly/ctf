Although\r\nthis memo is intended to be mainly descriptive, the Security\r\nConsiderations section makes some purely advisory recommendations\r\nabout how to deal with security vulnerabilities the applications\r\ncould inadvertently create when using the methods described.  This\r\nmemo covers NAT traversal approaches used by both TCP- and UDP-based\r\napplications.  This memo is not an endorsement of the methods\r\ndescribed, but merely an attempt to capture them in a document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2008","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5128","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5128"}
