However, this data can\r\nbe moderately sensitive in many applications. While there have been\r\nprevious attempts to protect this data, they have had limited\r\ndeployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 3711, the SRTP specification, and defines\r\nCryptex as a new mechanism that completely encrypts header extensions\r\nand CSRCs and uses simpler Session Description Protocol (SDP)\r\nsignaling with the goal of facilitating deployment.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":["SRTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3711"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9335","errata_url":null}
