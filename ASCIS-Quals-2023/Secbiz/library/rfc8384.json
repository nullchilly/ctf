Such an endnode is known as a \"Smart              \r\nEndnode\".  Only the attached edge RBridge can distinguish a \"Smart              \r\nEndnode\" from a \"normal endnode\".  The Smart Endnode uses the\r\nnickname of the attached edge RBridge, so this solution does not\r\nconsume extra nicknames.  The solution also enables endnodes that are\r\nFine-Grained Label (FGL) aware.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":["TRILL","Smart Endnode"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8384","errata_url":null}
