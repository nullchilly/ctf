However, in situations where the server operator\r\ndoes not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is useful to\r\nspecify filter rules explicitly.  This document defines the\r\nNAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In\r\nUser Service (RADIUS).  This attribute is based on the Diameter\r\nNAS-Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and\r\nthe IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588.
