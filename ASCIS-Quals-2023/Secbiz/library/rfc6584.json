The first scheme is based on RSA Digital\r\nSignatures.  The second scheme relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital\r\nSignature Algorithm (ECDSA).  The third scheme relies on a Group-\r\nkeyed Message Authentication Code (MAC).  Finally, the fourth scheme\r\nmerges the Digital Signature and group schemes.  These schemes have\r\ndifferent target use cases, and they do not all provide the same\r\nservice.
