A 6top SF decides\r\nwhen to add\/delete cells, and it triggers 6P Transactions.  The\r\ndefinition of SFs is out of scope for this document; however, this\r\ndocument provides the requirements for an SF.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["schedule management","distributed scheduling","time synchronized channel hopping scheduling"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8480","errata_url":null}
