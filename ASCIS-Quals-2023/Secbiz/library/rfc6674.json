GI-DS-Lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the\r\naccess gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using softwires with an embedded\r\nContext Identifier that uniquely identifies the end-system to which\r\nthe tunneled packets belong.  The access gateway determines which\r\nportion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies and sends\/\r\nreceives this portion to\/from this softwire.
