This document\r\ndescribes how a receiver in a multimedia conversation can pause and\r\nresume incoming data from a sender by sending real-time feedback\r\nmessages when using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for real-\r\ntime data transport.  This document extends the Codec Control Message\r\n(CCM) RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback package by explicitly\r\nallowing and describing specific use of existing CCMs and adding a\r\ngroup of new real-time feedback messages used to pause and resume RTP\r\ndata streams.
