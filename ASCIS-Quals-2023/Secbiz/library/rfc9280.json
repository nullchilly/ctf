The model\r\ndefines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy\r\ndefinition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working\r\nGroup (RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC Series\r\nApproval Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals. Second, policy\r\nimplementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production\r\nCenter (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration\r\nLimited Liability Company (IETF LLC).  In addition, various\r\nresponsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed alone\r\nor in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting\r\nEditor (RSCE), and IETF LLC. Finally, this document establishes the\r\nEditorial Stream for publication of future policy definition\r\ndocuments produced through the processes defined herein.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 8728.
