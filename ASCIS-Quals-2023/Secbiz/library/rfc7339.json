Even though the SIP protocol provides a\r\nlimited overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service\r\nUnavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to\r\noverload.  This document defines the behavior of SIP servers involved\r\nin overload control and also specifies a loss-based overload scheme\r\nfor SIP.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["SIP","Overload Control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7339","errata_url":null}
