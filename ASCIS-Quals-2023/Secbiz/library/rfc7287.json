This document describes\r\na base solution and an experimental protocol to support mobile\r\nmulticast senders in PMIPv6 domains for all three scenarios.\r\nProtocol optimizations for synchronizing PMIPv6 with PIM, as well as\r\na peering function for MLD proxies are defined.  Mobile sources\r\nalways remain agnostic of multicast mobility operations.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7287","errata_url":null}
