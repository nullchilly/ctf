With some IPsec peers, particularly in the remote\r\naccess scenario, it is desirable to repeat the mutual authentication\r\nperiodically.  The purpose of this is to limit the time that security\r\nassociations (SAs) can be\r\nused by a third party who has gained control of the IPsec peer.  This\r\ndocument describes a mechanism to perform this function.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2006","keywords":["[--------|e]","lifetime"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4478","errata_url":null}
