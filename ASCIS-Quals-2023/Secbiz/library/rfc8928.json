The new extension is called Address-Protected\r\nNeighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address\r\nagainst address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and\r\nLossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a\r\ncryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of\r\ntheir Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the\r\nRegistered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of\r\nthe Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the\r\nCrypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of\r\nthat address can modify the registration information, thereby\r\nenforcing Source Address Validation.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["Address registration","Network Overlay","host to router interface"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8505"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8928","errata_url":null}
