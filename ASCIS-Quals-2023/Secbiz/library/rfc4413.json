Many of the\r\nfields exhibit static behavior or change in a more or less\r\npredictable way.  When a header compression scheme is designed, it is\r\nof fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the fields in\r\ndetail.  An example of this analysis can be seen in RFC 3095.\r\nThis memo performs a similar role for the compression of TCP\/IP\r\nheaders.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2006","keywords":["transmission control protocol","header compression"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4413","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4413"}
