It\r\nencompasses various techniques for remote data generation,\r\ncollection, correlation, and consumption. This document describes an\r\narchitectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by\r\nchallenges that are encountered as part of the operation of networks\r\nand by the requirements that ensue. This document clarifies the\r\nterminology and classifies the modules and components of a network\r\ntelemetry system from different perspectives. The framework and\r\ntaxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related\r\nwork and provide guidance for related technique and standard\r\ndevelopments.","pub_date":"May 2022","keywords":["Telemetry","OAM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9232","errata_url":null}
