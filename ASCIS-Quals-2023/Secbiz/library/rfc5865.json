This traffic class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop\r\nBehavior.  This traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission\r\nControl (CAC) procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity\r\nadmission.  This differs from a real-time traffic class that conforms to the\r\nExpedited Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior but is not subject to capacity\r\nadmission or subject to very coarse capacity admission.
