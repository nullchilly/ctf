Multiple\r\ntrees can be used by an ingress Routing Bridge (RBridge) for flows,\r\nregardless of the VLAN, Fine-Grained Label (FGL), and\/or multicast\r\ngroup of the flow.  Different ingress RBridges may choose different\r\ndistribution trees for TRILL Data packets in the same VLAN, FGL,\r\nand\/or multicast group.  To avoid unnecessary link utilization,\r\ndistribution trees should be pruned based on one or more of the\r\nfollowing: VLAN, FGL, or multicast destination address.  If any\r\nVLAN, FGL, or multicast group can be sent on any tree, for typical\r\nfast-path hardware, the amount of pruning information is multiplied\r\nby the number of trees, but there is limited hardware capacity for\r\nsuch pruning information.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies an optional facility to restrict the TRILL\r\nData packets sent on particular distribution trees by VLAN, FGL,\r\nand\/or multicast groups, thus reducing the total amount of pruning\r\ninformation so that it can more easily be accommodated by fast-path\r\nhardware.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["VLAN","fine-grained label","multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7968","errata_url":null}
