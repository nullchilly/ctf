However, the benefits of IPsec come at the cost of\r\nincreased overhead.  This document outlines a framework for\r\nintegrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over IPsec (ROHCoIPsec).\r\nBy compressing the inner headers of IP packets, ROHCoIPsec proposes\r\nto reduce the amount of overhead associated with the transmission of\r\ntraffic over IPsec Security Associations (SAs).
