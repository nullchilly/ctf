This allows the usage of SCTP in networks with legacy\r\nNATs that do not support SCTP.  It can also be used to implement SCTP\r\non hosts without directly accessing the IP layer, for example,\r\nimplementing it as part of the application without requiring special\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this document only describes the functionality\r\nrequired within an SCTP stack to add on UDP encapsulation, providing\r\nonly those mechanisms for two end-hosts to communicate with each\r\nother over UDP ports.  In particular, it does not provide mechanisms\r\nto determine whether UDP encapsulation is being used by the peer, nor\r\nthe mechanisms for determining which remote UDP port number can be\r\nused.  These functions are out of scope for this document.\r\n\r\nThis document covers only end-hosts and not tunneling (egress or\r\ningress) endpoints.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8899"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6951","errata_url":null}
