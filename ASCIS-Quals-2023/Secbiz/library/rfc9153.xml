  This document defines terminology and requirements for solutions produced by
  the Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Working Group. These
  solutions will support Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification and
  tracking (UAS RID) for security, safety, and other purposes (e.g.,
  initiation of identity-based network sessions supporting UAS applications).
  DRIP will facilitate use of existing Internet resources to support RID and
  to enable enhanced related services, and it will enable online and offline
  verification that RID information is trustworthy.

  This document defines terminology and requirements for solutions produced by
  the Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Working Group. These
  solutions will support Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification and
  tracking (UAS RID) for security, safety, and other purposes (e.g.,
  initiation of identity-based network sessions supporting UAS applications).
  DRIP will facilitate use of existing Internet resources to support RID and
  to enable enhanced related services, and it will enable online and offline
  verification that RID information is trustworthy.

	Many considerations (especially safety and security) necessitate 
	Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification and tracking 
	(UAS RID).
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">
	Unmanned Aircraft (UA) may be fixed-wing, rotary-wing (e.g., 
	helicopter), hybrid, balloon, rocket, etc. Small fixed-wing UA 
	typically have Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capability; rotary-wing and
	hybrid UA typically have Vertical Take-Off and Landing 
	(VTOL) capability. UA may be single- or multi-engine. The most 
	common today are multicopters (rotary-wing, multi-engine). The 
	explosion in UAS was enabled by hobbyist development 
        of advanced flight stability algorithms for multicopters that enabled even
        inexperienced pilots to take off, fly to a location of interest,
        hover, and return to the takeoff location or land at a
	distance. UAS can be remotely piloted by a human (e.g., with a 
	joystick) or programmed to proceed from Global Navigation Satellite 
	System (GNSS) waypoint to waypoint in a weak form of autonomy; 
	stronger autonomy is coming. 
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-3">
	Small UA are "low observable" as they:

        <ul spacing="normal" empty="false" bare="false" indent="3" pn="section-1.1-4">

          <li pn="section-1.1-4.2">
		make noise that is quite noticeable at short ranges but difficult to 
		detect at distances they can quickly close (500 meters in under 
		13 seconds by the fastest consumer mass-market drones available
		in early 2021);
	</li>
          <li pn="section-1.1-4.3">
		typically fly at low altitudes (e.g.,  
		under 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) for UA to which RID applies in the US, as 
		per <xref target="Part107" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Part107"/>); and
	</li>
          <li pn="section-1.1-4.4">
		are highly maneuverable and thus can fly under trees and between
		buildings.
	</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-5">
	UA can carry payloads (including sensors, cyber weapons, and kinetic weapons)
	or can be used themselves as weapons by flying them into targets. 
	They can be flown by clueless, careless, or criminal operators. 
	Thus, the most basic function of UAS RID is "Identification Friend 
	or Foe (IFF)" to mitigate the significant threat they present.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-6"> 
        Diverse other applications can be enabled or facilitated by RID.
        Internet protocols typically start out with at least one entity
        already knowing an identifier or locator of another; but an entity 
	(e.g., UAS or Observer device) encountering an a priori
	unknown UA in physical space has no identifier or logical space 
	locator for that UA, unless and until one is provided somehow. RID 
	provides an identifier, which, if well chosen, can facilitate use 
	of a variety of Internet family protocols and services to support 
	arbitrary applications beyond the basic security functions of RID. 
	For most of these, some type of identifier is essential, e.g., 
	Network Access Identifier (NAI), Digital Object Identifier (DOI), 
	Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), domain name, or public key. DRIP 
	motivations include both the basic security and the broader 
	application support functions of RID. The general scenario is 
	illustrated in <xref target="Scenario" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>.

	Note the absence of any links to/from the UA in the figure; this is 
	because UAS RID and other connectivity involving the UA varies. 
	Some connectivity paths do or do not exist depending upon the 
	scenario. Command and Control (C2) from the Ground Control Station (GCS) to the UA via the 
	Internet (e.g., using LTE cellular) is expected to become much more 
	common as Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) operations increase; 
	in such a case, there is typically not also a direct wireless link 
	between the GCS and UA. Conversely, if C2 is running over a direct 
	wireless link, then the GCS typically has Internet 
	connectivity, but the UA does not. Further, paths that nominally exist, such as between 
	an Observer device and the Internet, may be severely intermittent.

	Using UAS RID to facilitate vehicular (i.e., Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)) communications and

	systems and information beyond mere identification (primarily to 
	hold operators accountable after the fact), including DAA, were
	declared out of scope in ASTM F38.02 WK65041, based on a 
	distinction between RID as a security standard versus DAA as a safety 
	application. Standards Development Organizations 
	(SDOs) in the aviation community generally set a higher bar for safety than for security,

	The origin of information in UAS RID and UAS Traffic Management 
	(UTM) generally is the UAS or its operator. Self-reports may be 
	initiated by the Remote Pilot at the console of the GCS (the UAS subsystem used to remotely operate the UA) 
	or automatically by GCS software; in Broadcast RID, they are typically 
	initiated automatically by a process on the UA. Data in 
	the reports may come from sensors available to the operator (e.g., 
	radar or cameras), the GCS (e.g., "dead reckoning" UA location, 
	starting from the takeoff location and estimating the displacements 
	due to subsequent piloting commands, wind, etc.), or the UA itself 
	(e.g., an on-board GNSS receiver). In Broadcast RID, all the data 
	must be sent proximately by the UA, and most of the data ultimately comes
	from the UA. Whether information comes proximately from the 
	operator or from automated systems configured by the operator, 
	there are possibilities of unintentional error in and
	intentional falsification of this data.
	Mandating UAS RID, 
	specifying data elements required to be sent, monitoring compliance,
	and enforcing compliance (or penalizing non-compliance) are matters for 
	Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) and potentially other authorities. Specifying message 
	formats and supporting technologies to carry those data elements has been addressed by

	Wireless data links to or from UA are challenging. Flight is often

 DRIP's initial objective is to make RID immediately actionable,
 especially in emergencies, in severely constrained UAS environments
 (both Internet and local-only connected scenarios), balancing legitimate
 (e.g., public safety) authorities' Need To Know trustworthy information
 with UAS operators' privacy.
	The phrase
	"immediately actionable" means information of sufficient 
	precision, accuracy, and timeliness for an Observer to use it as 
	the basis for immediate decisive action (e.g., triggering
	a defensive counter-UAS system, attempting to initiate 
	communications with the UAS operator, accepting the presence of the 
	UAS in the airspace where/when observed as not requiring further 
	action, etc.) with potentially severe consequences of any 
	action or inaction chosen based on that information. For further 
	explanation of the concept of immediate actionability, see <xref target="ENISACSIRT" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ENISACSIRT"/>.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.3-2">
	Note that UAS RID must achieve nearly universal adoption, but DRIP can
	add value even if only selectively deployed. Authorities with
	jurisdiction over more sensitive airspace volumes may set a RID
	requirement, for flight in such volumes, that is higher than generally
	mandated.  Those with a greater need for high-confidence IFF can equip
	with DRIP, enabling strong authentication of their own aircraft and

	CAAs worldwide are mandating UAS RID. The European Union Aviation

	key role that UAS RID plays in UAS Traffic Management
   (UTM) in 
	<xref target="FAACONOPS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FAACONOPS"/> (especially Section 
	2.6). At the time of writing, CAAs promulgate performance-based 
	regulations that do not specify techniques but rather cite 
	industry consensus technical standards as acceptable means of 
	compliance.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">  
	The most widely cited such industry consensus technical standard
	for UAS RID is <xref target="F3411-19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="F3411-19"/>, which 
	defines two means of UAS RID:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3-3">
        <li pn="section-3-3.1">
		Network RID defines a set of information for UAS to make 
		available globally indirectly via the Internet, through servers 
		that can be queried by Observers.
	</li>
        <li pn="section-3-3.2">
		Broadcast RID defines a set of messages for UA to transmit 
		locally directly one-way over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (without IP or 
		any other protocols between the data link and application 
		layers), to be received in real time by local Observers.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">
	UAS using both means must send the same UAS RID application-layer 
	information via each <xref target="F3411-19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="F3411-19"/>.
	The presentation may differ, as Network RID defines a data 
	dictionary, whereas Broadcast RID defines message formats (which 
	carry items from that same data dictionary). The interval (or rate) 
	at which it is sent may differ, as Network RID can accommodate 
	Observer queries asynchronous to UAS updates (which generally need 
	be sent only when information, such as location, changes), whereas 
	Broadcast RID depends upon Observers receiving UA messages at the 
	time they are transmitted.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-5">	
	Network RID depends upon Internet connectivity in several segments 
	from the UAS to each Observer.
  Broadcast RID should need Internet
  (or other Wide Area Network) connectivity only to retrieve registry 
  information, using, as the primary unique key for database lookup, 
  the UAS
   Identifier (UAS ID) that was directly locally received.	
	Broadcast RID does not assume IP connectivity of UAS; messages are 
	encapsulated by the UA <em>without IP</em>, directly in link-layer 
	frames (Bluetooth 4, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi NAN, IEEE 802.11 Beacon, or

	The selection of Broadcast RID media was driven by research into 
	what is commonly available on "ground" units (smartphones and 
	tablets) and what was found as prevalent or "affordable" in UA. 
	Further, there must be an API for the Observer's receiving 
	application to have access to these messages. As yet, only Bluetooth 
	4.x support is readily available; thus, the current focus is on 
	working within the 31-byte payload limit of the Bluetooth 4.x 
	"Broadcast Frame" transmitted as an "advertisement" on beacon

   In order to enable Observer devices to verify that 1) the claimed UAS ID is indeed owned by the sender

too long to fit in a single frame, even with the latest schemes currently being standardized.</t>

   This correlation is expected to be done on the basis of Media Access
   Control (MAC) address. This may be complicated by MAC address

	UAS RID and UTM are complementary; Network RID is a UTM service. 
	The backbone of the UTM system is comprised of multiple USS: one or

	others span multiple jurisdictions. USS also serve as the 
	principal, or perhaps the sole, interface for operators and UAS into 
	the UTM environment. Each operator subscribes to at least one USS. 
	Each UAS is registered by its operator in at least one USS. Each 
	operational intent is submitted to one USS; if approved, that UAS 
	and operator can commence that operation. During the operation, 
	status and location of that UAS must be reported to that USS, which,

	USS provide services not limited to Network RID; indeed, the primary

	manned aircraft and rocket
	launch. Most deconfliction involving a given operation is hoped to be
	completed prior to commencing that operation; this is called "strategic
	deconfliction". If that fails, "tactical deconfliction" comes into
	play; AirBorne DAA (ABDAA) may not involve USS, but Ground-Based DAA (GBDAA)
	likely will.  Dynamic
	constraints, formerly called "UAS Volume Restrictions (UVRs)", can be

	authorities on the ground, and propagated in UTM.

	UAS RID and related services.
   RID services are used

	The Provable Ownership requirement addresses the possibility that the

	could meet this requirement by, for example, verifying an asymmetric
	cryptographic signature using a sender-provided public key from which
	the asserted UAS ID can be at least partially derived.  The Provable

	upon the Observer being able to contact the registry at the time of
	observing the UA.  The Readability requirement pertains to the

	encoding in transit, so it may involve machine-assisted format
	conversions (e.g., from binary encodings) and/or decryption (see <xref target="priv" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3"/>).

	which may agree or disagree with the self-report in the set of 
	messages; (2) defend against replay attacks; and (3) support 
	optional SDSP services such as multilateration, to complement UAS 
	position self-reports with independent measurements. This is the 
	only instance in which DRIP transports <xref target="F3411-19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="F3411-19"/> messages; most of DRIP pertains to the

	that UAS, but AAA and policy restrictions, inter alia on 
	resolving the identifier to any locators (typically IP addresses), 
	should prevent unauthorized parties from distracting or harassing 
	pilots. Thus, some but not all Observers of UA, receivers of 
	Broadcast RID, clients of Network RID, and other parties can 
	become successfully initiating endpoints for these sessions.

	The QoS requirement is only that performance and reliability 
	parameters can be <em>specified</em> by policy, not that any such 
	specifications must be guaranteed to be met; any failure to meet 
	such would be reported under the Management requirement. Examples 
	of such parameters are the maximum time interval at which messages 
	carrying required data elements may be transmitted, the maximum 
	tolerable rate of loss of such messages, and the maximum tolerable 
	latency between a dynamic data element (e.g., GNSS position of UA)

	Registries are fundamental to RID. Only very limited information can
	be transmitted via Broadcast RID, but extended information is sometimes needed. The most
	essential element of information sent is the UAS ID itself, the unique
	key for lookup of extended information in registries.
The regulatory requirements for the registry information models for UAS and
their operators for RID and, more broadly, for U-space/UTM needs are in flux.
Thus, beyond designating the UAS ID as that unique key, the registry information
model is not specified in this document.
	While it is expected that
	registry functions will be integrated with USS, who will provide them
	is expected to vary between jurisdictions and has not yet been determined in
	most jurisdictions. However this evolves, the essential registry
	functions, starting with management of identifiers, are expected to
	remain the same, so those are specified herein.
</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4.2-2">	
	While most data to be sent via Broadcast or Network RID is public, 
	much of the extended information in registries will be private. 
	Thus, AAA for registries is essential, not just to ensure that 
	access is granted only to strongly authenticated, duly authorized 
	parties, but also to support subsequent attribution of any leaks, 
	audit of who accessed information when and for what purpose, etc. 
	Specific AAA requirements will vary by jurisdictional 
	regulation, provider philosophy, customer demand, etc., so they are 
	left to specification in policies. Such policies should be human readable 
	to facilitate analysis and discussion, be machine readable to 
	enable automated enforcement, and use a language amenable to both, 
	e.g., eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).
</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4.2-3">
	The intent of the negative and positive access control requirements 
	on registries is to ensure that no member of the public would be 
	hindered from accessing public information, while only duly 
	authorized parties would be enabled to access private information. 
	Mitigation of denial-of-service attacks and refusal to allow 
	database mass scraping would be based on those behaviors, not on 
	identity or role of the party submitting the query per se;
	 however, 
   information on the identity of the party submitting the query might be 
   gathered on such misbehavior by security systems protecting DRIP
   implementations.

	One approach to so doing involves verifiably binding the DRIP 
	identifier to a public key. Providing these security features, 
	whether via this approach or another, is likely to be especially 
	challenging for Observers without Internet connectivity at the time 
	of observation. For example, checking the signature of a registry 
	on a public key certificate received via Broadcast RID in a remote 
	area presumably would require that the registry's public key had 
	been previously installed on the Observer's device, yet there may 
	be many registries and the Observer's device may be storage 
	constrained, and new registries may come on-line subsequent to 
	installation of DRIP software on the Observer's device. See also 
	<xref target="Scenario" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> and the associated 
	explanatory text, especially the second paragraph after the figure. 
	Thus, there may be caveats on the extent to which requirements can 
	be satisfied in such cases, yet strenuous effort should be made to 
	satisfy them, as such cases are important, e.g., firefighting in a national 
	forest. Each numbered requirement a priori 
	expected to suffer from such limitations (General requirements for 
	Gateway and Contact functionality) contains language stating when 
	it applies.

	Privacy and transparency are important for legal reasons including 
	regulatory consistency. <xref target="EU2018" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EU2018"/> 
	states:</t>
      <blockquote pn="section-7-2">
	harmonised and interoperable national registration

        </blockquote>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3">	
	Transparency (where essential to security or safety) and privacy
	are also ethical and moral imperatives. Even in cases where old 
	practices (e.g., automobile registration plates) could be imitated, 
	when new applications involving PII (such as UAS RID) are addressed 
	and newer technologies could enable improving privacy, such 
	opportunities should not be squandered. Thus, it is recommended that 
	all DRIP work give due regard to <xref target="RFC6973" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6973"/> and, more broadly, to <xref target="RFC8280" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8280"/>.

DRIP information falls into two classes:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" empty="false" bare="false" indent="3" pn="section-7-6">
        <li pn="section-7-6.1">that which, to achieve the

	any Observer (e.g., the basic UAS ID itself); and </li>
        <li pn="section-7-6.2">that which must 
	be protected (e.g., PII of pilots) but made available to properly 
	authorized parties (e.g., public safety personnel who urgently need 
   to contact pilots in emergencies).</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-7">
	How properly authorized parties are authorized, authenticated, etc. 
	are questions that extend beyond the scope of DRIP, but DRIP may be 
	able to provide support for such processes. Classification of 
	information as public or private must be made explicit and 
	reflected with markings, design, etc. Classifying the information 
	will be addressed primarily in external standards; in this document, it will 
	be regarded as a matter for CAA, registry, and operator policies, 
	for which enforcement mechanisms will be defined within the scope 
	of the DRIP WG and offered. Details of the protection mechanisms will 
	be provided in other DRIP documents. Mitigation of adversarial 
	correlation will also be addressed.

              <t indent="0">This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.</t>

              <t indent="0">This memo describes the Host Identity (HI) namespace, which provides a cryptographic namespace to applications, and the associated protocol layer, the Host Identity Protocol, located between the internetworking and transport layers, that supports end-host mobility, multihoming, and NAT traversal. Herein are presented the basics of the current namespaces, their strengths and weaknesses, and how a HI namespace will add completeness to them. The roles of the HI namespace in the protocols are defined. </t>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility. The Security Considerations section also describes measures against flooding attacks, usage of identities in access control lists, weaker types of identifiers, and trust on first use. This document incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 7401 and goes further to explain how HIP works as a secure signaling channel.</t>

	This document is largely based on the process of one SDO -- ASTM.
	Therefore, it is tailored to specific needs and data formats of ASTM's
	"Standard Specification for Remote ID and Tracking" <xref target="F3411-19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="F3411-19"/>. Other organizations (for
	example, in the EU) do not necessarily follow the same architecture.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-2">
	The need for drone ID and operator privacy is an open discussion 
	topic. For instance, in the ground vehicular domain, each car 
	carries a publicly visible plate number. In some countries, for 
	nominal cost or even for free, anyone can resolve the identity and 
	contact information of the owner. Civil commercial aviation and 
	maritime industries also have a tradition of broadcasting plane or 
	ship ID, coordinates, and even flight plans in plaintext. 
	Community networks such as OpenSky <xref target="OpenSky" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OpenSky"/> and Flightradar24 <xref target="FR24" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FR24"/> use this open information through ADS-B to 
	deploy public services of flight tracking. Many researchers also 
	use these data to perform optimization of routes and airport 
	operations. Such ID information should be integrity protected, but 
	not necessarily confidential.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-3">
	In civil aviation, aircraft identity is broadcast by a device known 
	as transponder. It transmits a four-octal digit squawk code, which 
	is assigned by a traffic controller to an airplane after approving 
	a flight plan. There are several reserved codes, such as 7600, that 
	indicate radio communication failure. The codes are unique in each 
	traffic area and can be re-assigned when entering another control 
	area. The code is transmitted in plaintext by the transponder and 
	also used for collision avoidance by a system known as Traffic 
	alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The system could be 
	used for UAS as well initially, but the code space is quite limited 
	and likely to be exhausted soon. The number of UAS far exceeds the 
	number of civil airplanes in operation.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-4">
	The ADS-B system is utilized in civil aviation for each "ADS-B Out" 
	equipped airplane to broadcast its ID, coordinates, and altitude 
	for other airplanes and ground control stations. If this system is 
	adopted for drone IDs, it has additional benefit with backward 
	compatibility with civil aviation infrastructure; then, pilots and 
	dispatchers will be able to see UA on their control screens and 
	take those into account. If not, a gateway translation system 
	between the proposed drone ID and civil aviation system should be 
	implemented. Again, system saturation due to large numbers of UAS 
	is a concern.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-5">
	The Mode S transponders used in all TCAS and most "ADS-B Out"
	installations are assigned an ICAO 24-bit "address" (arguably 
	really an identifier rather than a locator) that is associated with 
	the aircraft as part of its registration. In the US alone, well 
	over 2<sup>20</sup> UAS are already flying; thus, a 24-bit space likely would 
	be rapidly exhausted if used for UAS (other than large UAS flying 
	in controlled airspace, especially internationally, under rules 
	other than those governing small UAS at low altitudes).
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-6">
	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are two wireless technologies currently 
	recommended by ASTM specifications due to their widespread use and 
	broadcast nature. However, those have limited range (max 100s of 
	meters) and may not reliably deliver UAS ID at high altitude or 
	distance. Therefore, a study should be made of alternative 
	technologies from the telecom domain (e.g., WiMAX / IEEE 802.16, 5G) or 
	sensor networks (e.g., Sigfox, LoRa). Such transmission technologies can 
	impose additional restrictions on packet sizes and frequency of 
	transmissions but could provide better energy efficiency and 
	range.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-7">	
	In civil aviation, Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications 
	(CPDLC) is used to transmit command and control between the pilots 
	and ATC. It could be considered for UAS as well due to long-range 
	and proven use despite its lack of security <xref target="CPDLC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CPDLC"/>.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-8">
	L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) is being 
	standardized by ICAO and IETF for use in future civil aviation 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-raw-ldacs" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="LDACS"/>. LDACS
	provides secure communication, positioning, and control for aircraft 
	using a dedicated radio band. It should be analyzed as a potential 
	provider for UAS RID as well. This will bring the benefit of a 
	global integrated system creating awareness of global airspace use.
