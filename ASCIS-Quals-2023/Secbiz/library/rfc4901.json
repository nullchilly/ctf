HC can significantly reduce packet-header overhead\r\nand, in combination with MPLS, can also increases bandwidth\r\nefficiency and processing scalability in terms of the maximum number\r\nof simultaneous compressed flows that use HC at each router).  Here\r\nwe define how MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context\r\nand control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label\r\nswitching routers.  This is defined for a specific set of existing HC\r\nmechanisms that might be used, for example, to support voice over IP.\r\nThis specification also describes extension mechanisms to allow\r\nsupport for future, as yet to be defined, HC protocols.  In this\r\nspecification, each HC protocol operates independently over a single\r\npseudowire instance, very much as it would over a single\r\npoint-to-point link.
