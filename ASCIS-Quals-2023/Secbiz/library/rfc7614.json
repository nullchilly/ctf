Conflating the start of the subscription\r\nwith handling the REFER request makes negotiating SUBSCRIBE\r\nextensions impossible and complicates avoiding SIP dialog sharing.\r\nThis document defines extensions to REFER that remove the implicit\r\nsubscription and, if desired, replace it with an explicit one.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["SIP","SIP Events","nosub","explicitsub","Refer-Events-At"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7614","errata_url":null}
