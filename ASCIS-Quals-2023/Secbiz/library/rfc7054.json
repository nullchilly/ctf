More precisely, it describes important restrictions for\r\nany mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that\r\nthey can be targeted at MIPs on either incoming or outgoing interfaces and\r\nforwarded correctly through the forwarding engine.  Furthermore, the document\r\nincludes considerations for node implementations where there is no distinction\r\nbetween the incoming and outgoing MIP.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7054","errata_url":null}
