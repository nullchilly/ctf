The combination of\r\nIEEE 802.1X, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and RADIUS\r\nthat is used in eduroam provides a secure, scalable, and deployable\r\nservice for roaming network access.  The successful deployment of\r\neduroam over the last decade in the educational sector may serve as\r\nan example for other sectors, hence this document.  In particular,\r\nthe initial architectural choices and selection of standards are\r\ndescribed, along with the changes that were prompted by operational\r\nexperience.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["Federated Authentication","AAA","RADIUS","IEEE 802.1X","roaming","EAP","eduroam"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7593","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7593"}
