These enhancements include the use of a multicast tree\r\nmobility anchor as the topological anchor point for multicast\r\ntraffic, as well as a direct routing option where the Mobile Access\r\nGateway can provide access to multicast content in the local network.\r\nThe goal of these enhancements is to provide benefits such as\r\nreducing multicast traffic replication and supporting different\r\nPMIPv6 deployment scenarios.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["multimob","PMIPv6","MTMA","selector","MLD","IGMP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7028","errata_url":null}
