In certain technologies, OAM entities\r\nare inherently established once the connection is set up, while other\r\ntechnologies require extra configuration to establish and configure\r\nOAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to Resource\r\nReservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support the\r\nestablishment and configuration of OAM entities along with Label\r\nSwitched Path signaling.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["MPLS-TP","Transport Profile","GELS","Ethernet Label Switching","PBB-TE","connectivity monitoring","OAM configuration"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7260","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7260"}
