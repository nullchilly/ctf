{"draft":"draft-ietf-6man-multi-homed-host-10","doc_id":"RFC8028","title":"First-Hop Router Selection by Hosts in a Multi-Prefix Network","authors":["F. Baker","B. Carpenter"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"13","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IPv6 Maintenance","abstract":"This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario\r\nthat has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network\r\nthat is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host\r\nhas multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other\r\nscenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively\r\nact as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop\r\nrouter may interact with source address selection in a given\r\nimplementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a\r\npacket is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.\r\nGiven that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with\r\nmultiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to\r\nuse a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all\r\nneighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router\r\nAdvertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to\r\nwhich router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC\r\n4861.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4861"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8028","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8028"}
