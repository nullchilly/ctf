The\r\nserver-resident control-plane functionality resides in control\r\nsoftware, which may be part of hypervisor or container-management\r\nsoftware; for simplicity, this document refers to the hypervisor as\r\nthe \"location\" of this software.\r\n\r\nOne or more control-plane protocols between a hypervisor and its\r\nassociated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute\r\nits virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for\r\nfurther handling.  This document illustrates the functionality\r\nrequired by this type of control-plane signaling protocol and\r\noutlines the high-level requirements.  Virtual-machine states as well\r\nas state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol\r\nrequirements.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["NVO3","VDP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8394","errata_url":null}
