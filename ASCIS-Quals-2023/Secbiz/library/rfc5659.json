Scenarios\r\nare discussed where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated\r\nservice spans a different provider's PSN, as are other scenarios where the \r\nemulated service originates and terminates on the same provider's PSN, but may\r\npass through several PSN tunnel segments in that PSN.  It presents an\r\narchitectural framework for such multi-segment pseudowires, defines\r\nterminology, and specifies the various protocol elements and their\r\nfunctions.
