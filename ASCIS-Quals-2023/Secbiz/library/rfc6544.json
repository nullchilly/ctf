ICE works by providing a\r\nset of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are\r\nthen validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session\r\nTraversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework\r\nfor describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams.\r\nThis specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the\r\nability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single\r\nstream.
