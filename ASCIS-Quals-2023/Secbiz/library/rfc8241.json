The I2RS protocol is implemented by reusing\r\nportions of existing IETF protocols and adding new features to them.\r\nOne such reuse is of the security features of a secure transport\r\n(e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol,\r\nDatagram TLS (DTLS)) such as encryption, message integrity, mutual\r\npeer authentication, and anti-replay protection.  The new I2RS\r\nfeatures to consider from a security perspective are as follows: a\r\npriority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions, an\r\nopaque secondary identifier that identifies an application using the\r\nI2RS client, and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure\r\ntransport.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8241","errata_url":null}
