In certain scenarios, these Router Solicitations\r\ntransmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a\r\nmechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router\r\nSolicitations.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4861"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7559","errata_url":null}
