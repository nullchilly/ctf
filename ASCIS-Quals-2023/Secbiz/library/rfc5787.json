This document defines extensions to\r\nthe OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for\r\nrouting in an ASON.\r\n\r\nNote that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation\r\nexpressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations\r\ncurrent when those documents were written.  Future extensions of\r\nrevisions of this work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendations\r\nare revised or if new requirements are introduced into a revision of\r\nRFC 4258.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["[--------]","itu-t","ospfv2 link state routing protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6827"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5787","errata_url":null}
