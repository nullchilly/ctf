A\r\ncentralized gateway solution is typically used for Layer 3\r\ninter-subnet traffic forwarding but has the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. Sub-optimum forwarding paths for inter-subnet traffic.\r\n\r\n2. A centralized gateway that may need to support a very large\r\nnumber of gateway interfaces in a Data Center, one per tenant per\r\nData Label used by that tenant, to provide interconnect functionality\r\nfor all the Layer 2 Virtual Networks in a TRILL campus.\r\n\r\n3. A traffic bottleneck at the gateway.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies an optional TRILL distributed gateway\r\nsolution that resolves these centralized gateway issues.","pub_date":"September 2016","keywords":["tenant","data center"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7956","errata_url":null}
