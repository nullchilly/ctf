SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce switches'\r\nFiltering Database (FDB) table sizes and reduce impact of ARP and Neighbor\r\nDiscovery (ND) on network elements in an environment where hosts within one\r\nsubnet (or VLAN) can spread over various locations.  SARP is targeted for\r\nmassive data centers with a significant number of Virtual Machines (VMs) that\r\ncan move across various physical locations.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["ARP","data center","proxy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7586","errata_url":null}
