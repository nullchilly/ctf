The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism\r\nbetween a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex, composed\r\nof a combination of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network\r\nTermination (ONT) elements, is described in a multi-service reference\r\narchitecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related, and\r\nsubscriber-related operations.  The Access Node Control Mechanism is\r\nalso extended for interaction between components of the Access Node\r\nComplex (OLT and ONT).  The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure\r\nthat the transmission of information between the NAS and Access Node\r\nComplex (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does not need\r\nto go through distinct element managers but rather uses direct\r\ndevice-to-device communication and stays on net.  This allows for\r\nperforming access-link-related operations within those network\r\nelements to meet performance objectives.","pub_date":"June 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6934","errata_url":null}
