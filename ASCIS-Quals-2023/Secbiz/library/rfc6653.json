Based on the\r\nidea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix\r\nDelegation to address such prefix management issues as an access\r\nrouter offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a\r\nDHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an\r\nincoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may\r\nnext do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node,\r\ne.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe\r\nprefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\r\n(AAA) servers.
