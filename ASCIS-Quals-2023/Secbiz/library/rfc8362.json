Without LSA extension, attributes associated with OSPFv3\r\nlinks and advertised IPv6 prefixes must be advertised in separate\r\nLSAs and correlated to the fixed-format LSAs.  This document extends\r\nthe LSA format by encoding the existing OSPFv3 LSA information in\r\nType-Length-Value (TLV) tuples and allowing advertisement of\r\nadditional information with additional TLVs.  Backward-compatibility\r\nmechanisms are also described.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5340, \"OSPF for IPv6\", and RFC 5838,\r\n\"Support of Address Families in OSPFv3\", by providing TLV-based\r\nencodings for the base OSPFv3 unicast support and OSPFv3 address\r\nfamily support.","pub_date":"April 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5340","RFC5838"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8362","errata_url":null}
