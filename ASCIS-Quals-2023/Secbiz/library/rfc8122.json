It defines\r\nthe SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP\/TLS'.  It also defines the syntax\r\nand semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint' attribute that identifies the\r\ncertificate that will be presented for the TLS session.  This\r\nmechanism allows media transport over TLS connections to be\r\nestablished securely, so long as the integrity of session\r\ndescriptions is assured.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 4572 by clarifying the usage of multiple\r\nfingerprints.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["SDP","TLS","Fingerprint","Offer","Answer"],"obsoletes":["RFC4572"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8844"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8122","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8122"}
