Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is one\r\nof the mechanisms and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.\r\n\r\nThe definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby\r\nforcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions,\r\nimpeding interoperability.  Yet today we have a satisfactory set of\r\nimplementations that do interoperate.  This document is a new\r\ndefinition of AXFR -- new in the sense that it records an accurate\r\ndefinition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism.
