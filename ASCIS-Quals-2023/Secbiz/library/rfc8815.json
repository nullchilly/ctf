It recommends the use of\r\nSource-Specific Multicast (SSM) for interdomain multicast\r\napplications and recommends that hosts and routers in these\r\ndeployments fully support SSM.  The recommendations in this document\r\ndo not preclude the continued use of ASM within a single organization\r\nor domain and are especially easy to adopt in existing deployments of\r\nintradomain ASM using PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["ASM","Deprecate","Deprecation","Interdomain","Intradomain","PIM-SM","PIM-SSM","SSM","MSDP","MBONE","Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0229"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8815","errata_url":null}
