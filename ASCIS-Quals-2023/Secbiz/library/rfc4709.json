For\r\nexample, it is frequently desirable to be able to click on a link and\r\nhave this link open a window that can handle drag-and-drop\r\ninteraction with the resources of a WebDAV server.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a mechanism and a document format that\r\nenables WebDAV servers to send \"mounting\" information to a WebDAV\r\nclient.  The mechanism is designed to work on any platform and with\r\nany combination of browser and WebDAV client, relying solely on the\r\nwell-understood dispatch of documents through their MIME type.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2006","keywords":["drag-and-drop"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4709","errata_url":null}
