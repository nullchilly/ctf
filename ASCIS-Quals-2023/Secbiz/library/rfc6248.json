The current\r\nregistry structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to\r\nuniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent efforts to find\r\ncurrent or even future users, no one responded to the call for\r\ninterest in the RFC 4148 registry during the second half of 2010.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC4148"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4737","RFC5560","RFC5644","RFC6049"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6248","errata_url":null}
