While this\r\nproperty of \"path awareness\" already exists in many\r\nInternet-connected networks within single domains and via\r\nadministrative interfaces to the network layer, a fully path-aware\r\ninternetwork expands these concepts across layers and across the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nThis document poses questions in path-aware networking, open as of\r\n2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and\r\ndeployment of path-aware internetworks. It was originally written to\r\nframe discussions in the Path Aware Networking Research Group\r\n(PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this\r\nspace.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9217","errata_url":null}
