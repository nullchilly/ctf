The semantics discussion does not include any specification\r\nof a concrete syntax or a transport protocol.  However, a concrete\r\nprotocol is expected to implement the specified semantics or, more\r\nlikely, a superset of it.  The MIDCOM protocol semantics is derived\r\nfrom the MIDCOM requirements, from the MIDCOM framework, and from\r\nworking group decisions.  This document obsoletes RFC 3989.
