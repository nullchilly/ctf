The high-level requirements that informed\r\nthis change were defined in RFC 6949, \"RFC Series Format Requirements                 \r\nand Future Development\".  Plain text remains an important format for\r\nmany in the IETF community, and it will be one of the publication\r\nformats rendered from the XML.  This document outlines the rendering\r\nrequirements for the plain-text RFC publication format.  These\r\nrequirements do not apply to plain-text RFCs published before the\r\nformat transition.","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":["RFC","ASCII","format","plain-text","plain text","xml2rfcv3","v3"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7994","errata_url":null}
