The protocol is\r\nextended by the SIP-events notification framework to provide\r\nsubscriptions and notifications of SIP events.  One example of such\r\nevent notification mechanism is presence, which is expressed in XML\r\ndocuments called presence documents.  SIP can be compressed by using\r\nSignaling Compression (SigComp), which is enhanced by using the SIP\/\r\nSession Description Protocol (SDP) dictionary to achieve better\r\ncompression rates.  However, the SIP\/SDP dictionary is not able to\r\nincrease the compression factor of (typically lengthy) presence\r\ndocuments.  This memo defines the presence-specific static dictionary\r\nthat SigComp can use in order to compress presence documents to\r\nachieve higher efficiency.  The dictionary is compression-algorithm\r\nindependent.
