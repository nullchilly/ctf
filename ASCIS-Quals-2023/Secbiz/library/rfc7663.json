The goal\r\nof the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering guidance\r\non future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally\r\ndeployable approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the\r\nendpoints (in new transport layers and applications) as well as on\r\nmiddleboxes (run by network operators).  This document summarizes the\r\ncontributions to the workshop and provides an overview of the discussion\r\nat the workshop, as well as the outcomes and next steps identified by\r\nthe workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\r\nthose of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB\r\nviews and positions.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["transport layer","TCP","UDP","encapsulation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7663","errata_url":null}
