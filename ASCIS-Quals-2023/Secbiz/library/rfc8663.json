SR-MPLS can be leveraged to\r\nrealize a source-routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data\r\nplanes by using an MPLS label stack as a source-routing instruction\r\nset while making no changes to SR-MPLS specifications and\r\ninterworking with SR-MPLS implementations.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how SR-MPLS-capable routers and IP-only\r\nrouters can seamlessly coexist and interoperate through the use of\r\nSR-MPLS label stacks and IP encapsulation\/tunneling such as\r\nMPLS-over-UDP as defined in RFC 7510.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["SR-MPLS","MPLS-in-UDP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8663","errata_url":null}
