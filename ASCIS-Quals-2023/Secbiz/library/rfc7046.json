Multicast\r\ndata distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest\r\navailable layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast\r\ntechnologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service\r\nbinding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application\r\nthat runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most\r\nefficient multicast service available in the network.  Facing\r\nrobustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a\r\nstable upper-layer protocol provided by the application itself.  This\r\ndocument describes a common multicast API that is suitable for\r\ntransparent communication in underlay and overlay and that grants\r\naccess to the different flavors of multicast.  It proposes an\r\nabstract naming scheme that uses multicast URIs, and it discusses\r\nmapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution\r\ntechnologies.  Additionally, this document describes the application\r\nof this API for building gateways that interconnect current Multicast\r\nDomains throughout the Internet.  It reports on an implementation of\r\nthe programming Interface, including service middleware.  This\r\ndocument is a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast (SAM)\r\nResearch Group.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":["Peer-to-Peer (P2P)","adaptive multicast","multicast  naming","multicast addressing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7046","errata_url":null}
