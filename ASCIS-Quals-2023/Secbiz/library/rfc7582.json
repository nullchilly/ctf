These procedures allow customer multicast data to\r\ntravel across a service provider's backbone network through a set of\r\nmulticast tunnels.  The tunnels are advertised in certain BGP\r\nmulticast auto-discovery routes, by means of a BGP attribute known\r\nas the \"Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel\"\r\nattribute.  Encodings have been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel\r\nattribute to identify bidirectional (multipoint-to-multipoint)\r\nmulticast distribution trees.  However, the prior RFCs do not provide\r\nall the necessary procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to\r\nsupport multicast VPNs.  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and\r\n6625 by specifying those procedures.  In particular, it specifies the\r\nprocedures for assigning customer multicast flows (unidirectional or\r\nbidirectional) to specific bidirectional tunnels in the provider\r\nbackbone, for advertising such assignments, and for determining which\r\nflows have been assigned to which tunnels.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6513","RFC6514","RFC6625"],"updated_by":["RFC8534"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7582","errata_url":null}
