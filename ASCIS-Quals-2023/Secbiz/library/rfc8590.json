These\r\noperations may include contractual or policy requirements including,\r\nbut not limited to, regular batch processes, customer support\r\nactions, Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) or\r\nUniform Rapid Suspension (URS) actions, court-directed actions, and\r\nbulk updates based on customer requests.  Since the client is not\r\ndirectly involved or knowledgable of these operations, the extension\r\nis used along with an EPP object mapping to provide the resulting\r\nstate of the postoperation object, and optionally a preoperation\r\nobject, with the operation metadata of what, when, who, and why.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8590","errata_url":null}
