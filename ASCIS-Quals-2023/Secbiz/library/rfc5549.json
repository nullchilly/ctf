Rosen"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"10","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Softwires","abstract":"Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of network-layer\r\nprotocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may\r\nbelong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the\r\nSubsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).  The current AFI\/SAFI\r\ndefinitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for\r\nadvertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when\r\nadvertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or\r\nVPN-IPv4 NLRI.  This document specifies the extensions necessary to\r\nallow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address\r\nthat belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of\r\nthe AFI\/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for\r\nIPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the\r\nencoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the protocols\r\nthe address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing\r\nMP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4\r\nNLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.
