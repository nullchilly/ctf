This includes a three-bit field\r\ncalled the \"EXP field\".  The exact use of this field was not defined\r\nby these documents, except to state that it was to be \"reserved for\r\nexperimental use\".\r\n\r\nAlthough the intended use of the EXP field was as a \"Class of\r\nService\" (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these early\r\ndocuments because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to\r\nbe sufficiently defined.  Today a number of standards documents\r\ndefine its usage as a CoS field.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used, it has\r\nbecome increasingly necessary to rename this field.  This document\r\nchanges the name of the field to the \"Traffic Class field\" (\"TC\r\nfield\").  In doing so, it also updates documents that define the\r\ncurrent use of the EXP field.
