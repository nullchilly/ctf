Savola"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"6","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"HISTORIC","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":" In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 \/127 prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.  Under certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the problem; nevertheless, \/127 should be avoided between two routers.
