      <t pn="section-abstract-1">There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors
      and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements
      applied within a limited region of the Internet. Policies, default parameters,
      the options supported, the style of network management, and security
      requirements may vary between such limited regions. This document reviews
      examples of such limited domains (also known as controlled environments),
      notes emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy. It then
      briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains.
      Finally, it shows the need for a precise definition of "limited domain membership"
      and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other
      members, including boundary nodes.

      <t pn="section-1-1">
      As the Internet continues to grow and diversify, with a realistic
      prospect of tens of billions of nodes being connected directly and
      indirectly, there is a noticeable trend towards network-specific and
      local requirements, behaviors, and semantics.  The word "local" should
      be understood in a special sense, however. In some cases, it may refer to
      geographical and physical locality -- all the nodes in a single building,
      on a single campus, or in a given vehicle.  In other cases, it may refer
      to a defined set of users or nodes distributed over a much wider area,
      but drawn together by a single virtual network over the Internet, or a
      single physical network running in parallel with the Internet. We expand
      on these possibilities below. To capture the topic, this document refers
      to such networks as "limited domains". Of course, a similar situation may
      arise for a network that is completely disconnected from the Internet,
      but that is not our direct concern here. However, it should not be
      forgotten that interoperability is needed even within a disconnected
      network.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">Some people have concerns about splintering of the Internet along political
     or linguistic boundaries by mechanisms that block the free flow of information.
     That is not the topic of this document, which does not discuss filtering mechanisms
     (see <xref target="RFC7754" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7754"/>) and does not apply to protocols that
     are designed for use across the whole Internet. It is only concerned with domains
     that have specific technical requirements.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">The word "domain" in this document does not refer to naming domains in the DNS,
     although in some cases, a limited domain might incidentally be congruent with
     a DNS domain. In particular, with a "split horizon" DNS configuration 
     <xref target="RFC6950" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6950"/>, the split might be at the edge of a limited domain.
     A recent proposal for defining definite perimeters within the DNS namespace
     <xref target="I-D.dcrocker-dns-perimeter" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DNS-PERIMETER"/> might also be considered to be a limited
     domain mechanism.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">Another term that has been used in some contexts is "controlled
      environment".  For example, <xref target="RFC8085" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8085"/>
      uses this to delimit the operational scope within which a particular
      tunnel encapsulation might be used. A specific example is GRE-in-UDP
      encapsulation <xref target="RFC8086" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8086"/>, which
      explicitly states that "The controlled environment has less restrictive
      requirements than the general Internet." For example,
      non-congestion-controlled traffic might be acceptable within the
      controlled environment. The same phrase has been used to delimit the
      useful scope of quality-of-service protocols <xref target="RFC6398" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6398"/>.  It is not necessarily the case that protocols will
      fail to operate outside the controlled environment, but rather that they
      might not operate optimally. In this document, we assume that "limited
      domain" and "controlled environment" mean the same thing in
      practice. The term "managed network" has been used in a similar way,
      e.g., <xref target="RFC6947" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6947"/>.  In the context of
      secure multicast, a "group domain of interpretation" is defined by <xref target="RFC6407" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6407"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">Yet more definitions of types of domains are to be found in the routing area,
     such as <xref target="RFC4397" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4397"/>, <xref target="RFC4427" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4427"/>, and <xref target="RFC4655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4655"/>.
     We conclude that the notion of a limited domain is very widespread in many aspects
     of Internet technology.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">The requirements of limited domains will depend on the deployment
      scenario.  Policies, default parameters, and the options supported may
      vary. Also, the style of network management may vary between a
      completely unmanaged network, one with fully autonomic management, one
      with traditional central management, and mixtures of the above. Finally,
      the requirements and solutions for security and privacy may vary.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">
     This document analyzes and discusses some of the consequences of this
     trend and how it may impact the idea of universal interoperability in the
     Internet. First, we list examples of limited domain scenarios and of
     technical solutions for limited domains, with the main focus being
     the Internet layer of the protocol stack. An appendix provides a taxonomy
     of the features to be found in limited domains. With this background, we
     discuss the resulting challenge to the idea that all Internet standards
     must be universal in scope and applicability. To the contrary, we assert
     that some protocols, although needing to be standardized and interoperable,
     also need to be specifically limited in their applicability.
     This implies that the concepts of a limited domain, and of its membership, need
     to be formalized and supported by secure mechanisms. While this document does
     not propose a design for such mechanisms, it does outline some
     functional requirements.

      <name slugifiedName="name-failure-modes-in-todays-int">Failure Modes in Today's Internet</name>
      <t pn="section-2-1">Today, the Internet does not have a well-defined concept of limited
      domains. One result of this is that certain protocols and features fail
      on certain paths.  Earlier analyses of this topic have focused either on
      the loss of transparency of the Internet <xref target="RFC2775" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2775"/> <xref target="RFC4924" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4924"/> or on the
      middleboxes responsible for that loss <xref target="RFC3234" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3234"/> <xref target="RFC7663" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7663"/> <xref target="RFC8517" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8517"/>.  Unfortunately, the problems
      persist both in application protocols and even in very fundamental
      mechanisms. For example, the Internet is not transparent to IPv6
      extension headers <xref target="RFC7872" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7872"/>, and Path
      MTU Discovery has been unreliable for many years <xref target="RFC2923" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2923"/> <xref target="RFC4821" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4821"/>.  IP
      fragmentation is also unreliable <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-frag-fragile" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FRAG-FRAGILE"/>, and problems
      in TCP MSS negotiation have been reported <xref target="I-D.andrews-tcp-and-ipv6-use-minmtu" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPV6-USE-MINMTU"/>.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">On the security side, the widespread insertion of firewalls at domain
      boundaries that are perceived by humans but unknown to protocols results
      in arbitrary failure modes as far as the application layer is
      concerned. There are operational recommendations and practices that
      effectively guarantee arbitrary failures in realistic scenarios <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPV6-EXT-HEADERS"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">Domain boundaries that are defined administratively (e.g., by address
      filtering rules in routers) are prone to leakage caused by human error,
      especially if the limited domain traffic appears otherwise normal to the
      boundary routers. In this case, the network operator needs to take
      active steps to protect the boundary. This form of leakage is much less
      likely if nodes must be explicitly configured to handle a given
      limited-domain protocol, for example, by installing a specific protocol
      handler.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">Investigations of the unreliability of IP fragmentation
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-frag-fragile" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FRAG-FRAGILE"/>
    and the filtering of IPv6 extension headers <xref target="RFC7872" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7872"/>
    strongly suggest that at least for
    some protocol elements, transparency is a lost cause and middleboxes are here to stay.
    In the following two sections, we show that some application environments require
    protocol features that cannot, or should not, cross the whole Internet.

      It must work with devices "out of the box" as shipped by their manufacturers
      and must create adequate security by default. Remote access may be required.
      The requirements and applicable principles are summarized in <xref target="RFC7368" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7368"/>.

      Remote access may be required.

        manufacturer but may include devices added by the vehicle's owner or
        operator. Parts of the network will have demanding performance and
        reliability requirements with implications for human safety.  Remote
        access may be required to certain functions but absolutely forbidden
        for others. Communication with other vehicles, roadside
        infrastructure, and external data sources will be required. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPWAVE-NETWORKING"/> for a

 real-time networks. These will exhibit specific technical requirements,
 including tough real-time performance targets. See, for example, <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578"/> for numerous use cases. An example is a
 building services network. This will be designed specifically for a
 particular building but using standard components. Additional devices may
 need to be added at any time. Parts of the network may have demanding
 reliability requirements with implications for human safety.  Remote access
 may be required to certain functions but absolutely forbidden for others. An
 extreme example is a network used for virtual reality or augmented reality
 applications where the latency requirements are very stringent.</li>

        flexible and covers many innovative types of networks, including ad hoc
        networks that are formed spontaneously and some applications of 5G
        technology, it seems reasonable to expect that IoT edge networks will
        have special requirements and protocols that are useful only within a
        specific domain, and that these protocols cannot, and for security
        reasons should not, run over the Internet as a whole.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-2.7" derivedCounter="7.">Constrained Networks. An important subclass of IoT networks consists of constrained
        networks <xref target="RFC7228" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7228"/> in which the nodes

        isolated and constrained in power (e.g., deep space networks) and are
        connected only intermittently to the outside, with a very long latency
        on such connections <xref target="RFC4838" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4838"/>. Clearly,
        the protocol requirements and possibilities are very specialized in
        such networks.</li>

        over many kilometers and over multiple separate sites, with multiple

        <li pn="section-3-2.10" derivedCounter="10.">Unsuitable standards. A situation that can arise in an enterprise
        network is that the Internet-wide solution for a particular
        requirement may either fail locally or be much more complicated than
        is necessary. An example is that the complexity induced by a mechanism
        such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/> is not justified within such a
        network.  Furthermore, ICE cannot be used in some cases because
        candidate addresses are not known before a call is established, so a

        by service-level agreements for availability, packet loss, and
        possibly multicast service. These are different from the previous
        case in that they mostly run over MPLS infrastructures, and the
        requirements for these services are well defined by the IETF.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-2.12" derivedCounter="12.">Data centers and hosting centers, or distributed services acting

        networks with well-known trademarked names, combining aspects of
        distributed enterprise networks, data centers, and CDNs. They have
        their own international networks bypassing the generic carriers. Like
        CDNs, they have numerous connections to the Internet, typically

      <t pn="section-3-3">Three other aspects, while not tied to specific network types, also strongly

        <li pn="section-3-4.1" derivedCounter="1.">Many of the above types of networks may be extended throughout

    Therefore, we argue that limited domains may overlap each other in an arbitrary

    controlled environments, specific tunneling and encapsulation techniques may
    be tailored for use within a given domain.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-4.2" derivedCounter="2.">Intent-Based Networking. In this concept, a network domain is

        Whatever technologies are used to support this will be applied

        domain are globally accessible.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-4.3" derivedCounter="3.">Network Slicing. A network slice is a form of virtual network that

        network <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ENHANCED-VPN"/>.

        technologies are used to support slicing will require a clear
        definition of the boundary of a given slice within a larger
        domain.</li>
      </ol>
      <t pn="section-3-5">While it is clearly desirable to use common solutions, and therefore common standards,
    wherever possible, it is increasingly difficult to do so while satisfying the widely varying
    requirements outlined above.
    However, there is a tendency when new protocols and protocol extensions are
    proposed to always ask the question "How will this work across the open Internet?"
    This document suggests that this is not always the best question. There are
    protocols and extensions that are not intended to work across the open Internet.
    On the contrary, their requirements and semantics are specifically limited (in the
    sense defined above).
      </t>
      <t pn="section-3-6">A common argument is that if a protocol is intended for limited use, the chances are
    very high that it will in fact be used (or misused) in other scenarios including the
    so-called open Internet. This is undoubtedly true and means that limited use is not
    an excuse for bad design or poor security. In fact, a limited use requirement potentially
    adds complexity to both the protocol and its security design, as discussed later.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-7">Nevertheless, because of the diversity of limited domains with
      specific requirements that is now emerging, specific standards (and ad
      hoc standards) will probably emerge for different types of domains. There
      will be attempts to capture each market sector, but the market will
      demand standardized solutions within each sector.  In addition,
      operational choices will be made that can in fact only work within a
      limited domain. The history of RSVP <xref target="RFC2205" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2205"/> illustrates that a standard defined as if it could
      work over the open Internet might not in fact do so. In general, we can
      no longer assume that a protocol designed according to classical
      Internet guidelines will in fact work reliably across the network as a
      whole. However, the "open Internet" must remain as the universal method
      of interconnection. Reconciling these two aspects is a major
      challenge.</t>

    field in any IP packet. 


Although there are some recommended code point values for specific per-hop

        states: "Specific features may need to be enforced at the boundaries
        of an SFC-enabled domain, for example to avoid leaking SFC

      <t pn="section-5-1">One consequence of the deployment of limited domains in the Internet
      is that some protocols will be designed, extended, or configured so that
      they only work correctly between end systems in such domains.  This is
      to some extent encouraged by some existing standards and by the
      assignment of code points for local or experimental use. In any case, it
      cannot be prevented. Also, by endorsing efforts such as Service Function
      Chaining, Segment Routing, and Deterministic Networking, the IETF is in
      effect encouraging such deployments. Furthermore, it seems inevitable,
      if the Internet of Things becomes reality, that millions of edge
      networks containing completely novel types of nodes will be connected to
      the Internet; each one of these edge networks will be a limited
      domain.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-2">It is therefore appropriate to discuss whether protocols or protocol
      extensions should sometimes be standardized to interoperate only within
      a limited-domain boundary. Such protocols would not be required to
      interoperate across the Internet as a whole. Various scenarios could
      then arise if there are multiple domains using the limited-domain

directly at the IP layer (i.e., with no tunnel encapsulating the packets), a
limited-domain protocol could be operated between those two parts regardless
of its special nature, as long as it respects standard IP formats and is not
arbitrarily blocked by firewalls.  A simple example is any protocol using a
port number assigned to a specific non-IETF protocol.

If a limited-domain protocol has domain-specific variants, such that
implementations in different domains could not interoperate if those domains
were unified by some mechanism as in scenario C, the protocol is not
interoperable in the normal sense.  If two domains using it were merged, the
protocol might fail unpredictably.  A simple example is any protocol using a
port number assigned for experimental use. Related issues are discussed in
<xref target="RFC5704" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5704"/>, including the complex example of
Transport MPLS.

      <t pn="section-5-4">To provide a widespread example, consider Differentiated Services
      <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/>. A packet containing any value
      whatsoever in the 6 bits of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
      is well formed and falls into scenario A. However, because the semantics
      of DSCP values are locally significant, the packet also falls into
      scenario D. In fact, Differentiated Services are only interoperable
      across domain boundaries if there is a corresponding agreement between
      the operators; otherwise, a specific gateway function is required for
      meaningful interoperability.  Much more detailed discussion is
      found in <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/> and <xref target="RFC8100" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8100"/>.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-5-5">To provide a provocative example, consider the proposal in
    <xref target="I-D.voyer-6man-extension-header-insertion" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPV6-SRH"/> that the restrictions
    in <xref target="RFC8200" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8200"/> should be relaxed to allow IPv6 extension headers to
    be inserted on the fly in IPv6 packets. If this is done in such a way that
    the affected packets can never leave the specific limited domain in which they
    were modified, scenario C applies. If the semantic content of the inserted
    headers is locally defined, scenario D also applies. In neither case is
    the Internet outside the limited domain disturbed. However, inside the
    domain, nodes must understand the variant protocol. Unless it is standardized
    as a formal version, with all the complexity that implies <xref target="RFC6709" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6709"/>,
    the nodes must all be non-standard to the extent of understanding
    the variant protocol. For the example of IPv6 header insertion, that
    means non-compliance with <xref target="RFC8200" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8200"/> within the domain, even if the
    inserted headers are themselves fully compliant. Apart from the issue
    of formal compliance, such deviations from documented standard behavior
    might lead to significant debugging issues. The possible practical impact
    of the header insertion example is explored in

      <t pn="section-5-6">The FAST proposal mentioned in <xref target="fast" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4, Paragraph 2, Item 5"/> 

    is also an interesting case study.  The semantics of FAST tickets <xref target="I-D.herbert-fast" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FAST"/> have limited scope.  However,
    they are designed in a way that, in principle, allows them to traverse the
    open Internet, as standardized IPv6 hop-by-hop options or even as a
    proposed form of IPv4 extension header <xref target="I-D.herbert-ipv4-eh" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPV4-EXT-HEADERS"/>. Whether such options can be used reliably across the
    open Internet remains unclear <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPV6-EXT-HEADERS"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-7">We conclude that it is reasonable to explicitly define limited-domain protocols, either
    as standards or as proprietary mechanisms, as long as they describe
    which of the above scenarios apply and they clarify how the domain is defined.
    As long as all relevant standards are respected outside
    the domain boundary, a well-specified limited-domain protocol need not
    damage the rest of the Internet. However, as described in the next section, mechanisms are
    needed to support domain membership operations.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-8">Note that this conclusion is not a recommendation to abandon the normal
    goal that a standardized protocol should be global in scope and able to
    interoperate across the open Internet. It is simply a recognition
    that this will not always be the case.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-functional-requirements-of-">Functional Requirements of Limited Domains</name>
      <t pn="section-6-1">Noting that limited-domain protocols have been defined in the past,
    and that others will undoubtedly be defined in the future, it is useful to consider
    how a protocol can be made aware of the domain within which it operates and how
    the domain boundary nodes can be identified. As the taxonomy in <xref target="taxo" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A"/>
    shows, there are numerous aspects to a domain. However,
    we can identify some generally required features and functions that would
    apply partially or completely to many cases.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-2">Today, where limited domains exist, they are essentially created by careful
    configuration of boundary routers and firewalls. If a domain is
    characterized by one or more address prefixes, address assignment to hosts
    must also be carefully managed. This is an error-prone method, and a combination
    of configuration errors and default routing can lead to unwanted traffic escaping
    the domain. Our basic assumption is therefore that it should be possible for domains
    to be created and managed
    automatically, with minimal human configuration. We now discuss
    requirements for automating domain creation and management.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-3">First, if we drew a topology map, any given domain -- virtual or
      physical -- will have a well-defined boundary between "inside" and
      "outside".  However, that boundary in itself has no technical meaning.
      What matters in reality is whether a node is a member of the
      domain and whether it is at the boundary between the domain and
      the rest of the Internet. Thus, the boundary in itself does not need to
      be identified, but boundary nodes face both inwards and outwards. Inside
      the domain, a sending node needs to know whether it is sending to an
      inside or outside destination, and a receiving node needs to know
      whether a packet originated inside or outside. Also, a boundary node
      needs to know which of its interfaces are inward facing or
      outward facing.  It is irrelevant whether the interfaces involved are
      physical or virtual.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-4">To underline that domain boundaries need to be identifiable, consider
      the statement from the Deterministic Networking Problem Statement <xref target="RFC8557" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8557"/> that "there is still a lack of
      clarity regarding the limits of a domain where a deterministic path can
      be set up". This remark can certainly be generalized.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-5">With this perspective, we can list some general functional requirements.
    An underlying assumption here is that domain membership operations should be cryptographically
    secured; a domain without such security cannot be reliably protected from attack.</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1" start="1" pn="section-6-6">
        <li pn="section-6-6.1" derivedCounter="1.">Domain Identity. A domain must have a unique and verifiable identifier;
    effectively, this should be a public key for the domain. Without this,
    there is no way to secure domain operations and domain membership.
    The holder of the corresponding private key becomes the trust anchor for the domain.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.2" derivedCounter="2.">Nesting. It must be possible for domains to be nested (see, for example, the
    network-slicing example mentioned above).</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.3" derivedCounter="3.">Overlapping. It must be possible for nodes and links to be in more than one domain
    (see, for example, the case of PvDs mentioned above).</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.4" derivedCounter="4.">Node Eligibility. It must be possible for a node to determine which domain(s)
    it can potentially join and on which interface(s).</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.5" derivedCounter="5.">Secure Enrollment. A node must be able to enroll in a given domain
        via secure node identification and to acquire relevant security
        credentials (authorization) for operations within the domain. If a
        node has multiple physical or virtual interfaces, individual
        enrollment for each interface may be required.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.6" derivedCounter="6.">Withdrawal. A node must be able to cancel enrollment in a given
domain.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.7" derivedCounter="7.">Dynamic Membership. Optionally, a node should be able to
        temporarily leave or rejoin a domain (i.e., enrollment is persistent
        but membership is intermittent).</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.8" derivedCounter="8.">Role, implying authorization to perform a certain set of actions.
    A node must have a verifiable role. In the simplest case,
    the role choices are "interior node" and "boundary node". In a boundary
    node, individual interfaces may have different roles, e.g., "inward
    facing" and "outward facing".</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.9" derivedCounter="9.">Peer Verification. A node must be able to verify whether another
        node is a member of the domain.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.10" derivedCounter="10.">Role Verification. A node should be able to learn the verified role of another node.
    In particular, it should be possible for a node to find boundary nodes (interfacing
    to the Internet).</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.11" derivedCounter="11.">Domain Data. In a domain with management requirements, it must
    be possible for a node to acquire domain policy and/or
    domain configuration data. This would include, for example, filtering policy
    to ensure that inappropriate packets do not leave the domain.</li>
      </ol>
      <t pn="section-6-7">These requirements could form the basis for further analysis and solution design.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-8">Another aspect is whether individual packets within a limited domain need to
    carry any sort of indicator that they belong to that domain or whether this
    information will be implicit in the IP addresses of the packet. A related question
    is whether individual packets need cryptographic authentication. This topic is
    for further study.</t>

    <section anchor="security" numbered="true" toc="include" removeInRFC="false" pn="section-7">
      <name slugifiedName="name-security-considerations">Security Considerations</name>
      <t pn="section-7-1">As noted above, a protocol intended for limited use may well be
      inadvertently used on the open Internet, so limited use is not an excuse for
      poor security. In fact, a limited use requirement potentially adds
      complexity to the security design.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-2">Often, the boundary of a limited domain will also act as a security boundary.
      In particular, it will serve as a trust boundary and as a boundary of
      authority for defining capabilities. For example, segment routing <xref target="RFC8402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8402"/>
      explicitly uses the concept of a "trusted domain" in this way. Within the boundary,
      limited-domain protocols or protocol features will be useful, but they will in
      many cases be meaningless or harmful if they enter or leave the domain.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-3">The boundary also serves to provide confidentiality and privacy for operational
      parameters that the operator does not wish to reveal. Note that this is distinct from
      privacy protection for individual users within the domain.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-4">The security model for a limited-scope protocol must allow for the
      boundary and in particular for a trust model that changes at the
      boundary. Typically, credentials will need to be signed by a
      domain-specific authority.</t>

This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a "virtual out-of-band channel" for Operations, Administration and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured, or misconfigured.</t>

            <t>This informational document discusses the use of embedded semantics within IPv6 address schemas.  Network operators who have large IPv6 address space may choose to embed some semantics into their IPv6 addressing by assigning additional significance to specific bits within the prefix.  By embedding semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the semantics of packets can be easily inspected.  This can simplify the packet differentiation process.  However, semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas have their own operational cost and even potential pitfalls.  Some complex semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas may also require new technologies in addition to existing Internet protocols.  The document aims to understand the usage of semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas, and neutrally analyze on the associated advantages, drawbacks and technical gaps for more complex address schemas.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and adds features that specific services require over and above traditional VPNs.  Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.  It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This document provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential new work.  Comparing to traditional VPNs, It is not envisaged that quite large numbers of VPN+ services will be deployed in a network.  In other word, it is not intended that all existing VPNs supported by a network will use VPN+ related techniques.</t>

            <t>This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets protocol. A ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a granted right to traverse a network or a request for network services to be applied. Applications request tickets from a local agent in the network and attach issued tickets to packets. Firewall tickets are issued to grant packets the right to traverse a network; service tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to a packets. A single ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket information. Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</t>

            <t>Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry by storm.  At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "Policy".  This document clarifies the concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of functionality that is associated with it.  The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t>

This contradicts explicit prohibition of this type of IPv6 packet proccessing in the IPv6 standard.  This memo describes the possible failures that can occur with EH insertion, the harm they can cause, and the existing model that is and should continue to be used to add new information to an existing IPv6 and other packets.</t>

This document analyzes both the general security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers and the specific security implications of each Extension Header and Option type.  Additionally, it discusses the operational and interoperability implications of discarding packets based on the IPv6 Extension Headers and IPv6 options they contain.  Finally, it provides advice on the filtering of such IPv6 packets at transit routers for traffic *not* directed to them, for those cases in which such filtering is deemed as necessary.</t>

Many implementations of TCP running over IPv6 neglect to check the IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU value when performing MSS negotiation and when constructing a TCP segment despite MSS being defined to be the MTU less the IP and TCP header sizes (60 bytes for IPv6).  This leads to oversized IPv6 packets being sent resulting in unintended Path Maximum Transport Unit Discovery (PMTUD) being performed and to fragmented IPv6 packets being sent.</t>

            <t>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy), and then lists up requirements for the extensions of those IPv6 protocols for IPv6-based vehicular networking.</t>

            <t>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.  This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <t>This document provides a review of previous IAB statements on Internet transparency, as well a discussion of new transparency issues.  Far from having lessened in relevance, technical implications of intentionally or inadvertently impeding network transparency play a critical role in the Internet's ability to support innovation and global communication. This document provides some specific illustrations of those potential impacts.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document identifies problems that may result from the absence of formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual interest between standards development organizations (SDOs).  Some of these problems may cause significant harm to the Internet.  The document suggests that a robust procedure is required prevent this from occurring in the future.  The IAB has selected a number of case studies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS), as recent examples to describe the hazard to the Internet architecture that results from uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.</t>
            <t>This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship between the IETF and the ITU-T.  In particular, this was achieved via the establishment of the "Joint working team on MPLS-TP".  In addition, the leadership of the two organizations agreed to improve inter-organizational working practices so as to avoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs.</t>
            <t>Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the scope of the document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping protocol interest with the IETF.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

This paper describes the flow label standard and discusses the implementation issues that it raises.  It then describes various published proposals for using the flow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent with the standard.  Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed.  We also question whether the standard should be revised.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>

            <t>Routing Bridges (RBridges) provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.  They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count.</t>
            <t>RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes.  They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol.</t>
            <t>The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups.  It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.

          <abstract>
            <t>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711. Specifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.  This memo documents an Internet  Best Current Practice.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain; some, for example, transform identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process, and then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS. Proposals incorporating sophisticated application behavior using DNS as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the DNS as an application platform.  This document explores the architectural consequences of using the DNS to implement certain application features, and it provides guidance to future application designers as to the limitations of the DNS as a substrate and the situations in which alternative designs should be considered.</t>

The goal of this document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations, and requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.</t>

            <t>Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The administrators face different challenges than operators of Internet access providers and have reasons for different priorities.  The overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet- facing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an IPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced with many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support strategies.</t>

            <t>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack Evolution program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI) workshop in Zurich on 26-27 January 2015 to explore the ability to evolve the transport layer in the presence of middlebox- and interface-related ossification of the stack.  The goal of the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering guidance on future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally deployable approaches with clear incentives to deployment both on the endpoints (in new transport layers and applications) as well as on middleboxes (run by network operators).  This document summarizes the contributions to the workshop and provides an overview of the discussion at the workshop, as well as the outcomes and next steps identified by the workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking" and "filtering", the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches.</t>

            <t>This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which packets with IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) are dropped in the Internet (as originally measured in August 2014 and later in June 2015, with similar results) and where in the network such dropping occurs.  The aforementioned results serve as a problem statement that is expected to trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets carrying IPv6 EHs so that the situation improves over time.  This document also explains how the results were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements can be reproduced by other members of the community and repeated over time to observe changes in the handling of packets with IPv6 EHs.</t>

            <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
            <t>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
            <t>Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>
            <t>This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</t>

            <t>This document specifies a method of encapsulating network protocol packets within GRE and UDP headers.  This GRE-in-UDP encapsulation allows the UDP source port field to be used as an entropy field. This may be used for load-balancing of GRE traffic in transit networks using existing Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) mechanisms. There are two applicability scenarios for GRE-in-UDP with different requirements: (1) general Internet and (2) a traffic-managed controlled environment.  The controlled environment has less restrictive requirements than the general Internet.</t>

Many network providers operate Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Treatment Aggregates for traffic marked with different Diffserv Per-Hop Behaviors and use MPLS for interconnection with other networks.  This document offers a simple interconnection approach that may simplify operation of Diffserv for network interconnection among providers that use MPLS and apply the Short Pipe Model.  While motivated by the requirements of MPLS network operators that use Short Pipe Model tunnels, this document is applicable to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments".  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.  A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain.  SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.</t>
            <t>SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  The segment to process is on the top of the stack.  Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.</t>
            <t>SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.  The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t>

            <t>RFC 3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the Internet.  Most of those middleboxes utilize or modify application- layer data.  This document primarily focuses on devices that observe and act on information carried in the transport layer, and especially information carried in TCP packets.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document describes open research challenges for network virtualization.  Network virtualization is following a similar path as previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically, cloud computing popularized migration of computing functions (e.g., applications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources to remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet.  In a similar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of networking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a virtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can be considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it not only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions but also involves abstraction of the network itself.  This document describes current research and engineering challenges in network virtualization including the guarantee of quality of service, performance improvement, support for multiple domains, network slicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and security, separation of control concerns, network function placement, and testing.  In addition, some proposals are made for new activities in the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these challenges. This document is a product of the Network Function Virtualization Research Group (NFVRG).</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in common a need for "deterministic flows".  "Deterministic" in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.</t>

            <t>This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>
