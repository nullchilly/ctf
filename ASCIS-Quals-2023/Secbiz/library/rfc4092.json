In particular, we define the sdp-anat SIP option-tag.  This SIP option-tag ensures that SDP session descriptions that use ANAT are only handled by SIP entities with ANAT support.  To justify the need for such a SIP option-tag, we describe what could possibly happen if an ANAT-unaware SIP entity tried to\r\nhandle media lines grouped with ANAT.
