This document provides guidelines on the use of\r\nUDP for the designers of unicast applications and upper-layer\r\nprotocols.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but\r\nthe document also provides guidance on other topics, including\r\nmessage sizes, reliability, checksums, and middlebox traversal.  This \r\ndocument specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"November 2008","keywords":["[--------]","user datagram protocol","congestion control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8085"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5405","errata_url":null}
