As the Packet Sampling (PSAMP) protocol is based on IPFIX,\r\nthese considerations are valid for PSAMP exports as well.\r\n\r\nThis method works by separating information common to several Flow\r\nRecords from information specific to an individual Flow Record.\r\nCommon Flow information is exported only once in a Data Record\r\ndefined by an Options Template, while the rest of the specific Flow\r\ninformation is associated with the common information via a unique\r\nidentifier.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5473","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5473"}
