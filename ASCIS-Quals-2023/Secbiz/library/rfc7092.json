The only term for such devices\r\nprovided in RFC 3261 is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which\r\nis defined as the logical concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server\r\n(UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC).\r\n\r\nThere are numerous types of SIP B2BUAs performing different roles in\r\ndifferent ways; for example, IP Private Branch Exchanges (IPBXs),\r\nSession Border Controllers (SBCs), and Application Servers (ASs).\r\nThis document identifies several common B2BUA roles in order to\r\nprovide taxonomy other documents can use and reference.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":["SIP","B2BUA","taxonomy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7092","errata_url":null}
