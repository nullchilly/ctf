For resiliency\r\npurposes, redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce\r\nthe consequences of an Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) or BGP\r\nsession breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic.  However, simply\r\ntaking down or even bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes\r\nmay still induce connectivity losses during the BGP convergence.  This\r\nis no longer satisfactory for new applications (e.g., voice over IP,\r\nonline gaming, VPN).  Therefore, a solution is required for the\r\ngraceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the\r\namount of traffic loss during a planned shutdown.  This document\r\nexpresses requirements for such a solution.  This document is not \r\nan Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":["routing","BGP","graceful","shutdown","connectivity loss","maintenance","network operation","make-before-break","planned"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6198","errata_url":null}
