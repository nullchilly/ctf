The Internet Key\r\nExchange (IKE (RFC 2409) and IKEv2) provide a mechanism to\r\nnegotiate which algorithms should be used in any given association.\r\nHowever, to ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it\r\nis necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to\r\nensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have\r\navailable.  This document defines the current set of algorithms that are\r\nmandatory to implement as part of IKEv2, as well as algorithms that\r\nshould be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some\r\nfuture time.
