PPP also defines an extensible Link Control\r\nProtocol, and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols\r\n(NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer\r\nprotocols.\r\n\r\nThe IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP), which is an NCP for a PPP\r\nlink, allows for the negotiation of desirable parameters for an\r\nIPv6 interface over PPP.\r\n\r\nThis document defines the IPv6 datagram compression option that\r\ncan be negotiated by a node on the link through the IPV6CP.
