When multicast is not available to connect the multicast\r\nsites together, a signal-free mechanism can be used to allow traffic\r\nto flow between sites.  The mechanism described in this document uses\r\nunicast replication and encapsulation over the core network for the\r\ndata plane and uses the LISP mapping database system so encapsulators\r\nat the source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators at the\r\nreceiver LISP multicast sites.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["LISP","deployment"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8378","errata_url":null}
