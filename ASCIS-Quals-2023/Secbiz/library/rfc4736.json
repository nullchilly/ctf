This document\r\nproposes a mechanism that allows a TE LSP head-end Label Switching\r\nRouter (LSR) to trigger a new path re-evaluation on every hop that has\r\na next hop defined as a loose or abstract hop and a mid-point LSR to\r\nsignal to the head-end LSR that a better path exists (compared to the\r\ncurrent path) or that the TE LSP must be reoptimized (because of\r\nmaintenance required on the TE LSP path).  The proposed mechanism\r\napplies to the cases of intra- and inter-domain (Interior Gateway\r\nProtocol area (IGP area) or Autonomous System) packet and non-packet\r\nTE LSPs following a loosely routed path.
