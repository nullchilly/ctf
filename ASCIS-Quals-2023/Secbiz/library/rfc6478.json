Such a mechanism is\r\nsuitable for use where no PW dynamic control plane exits, known as\r\nstatic PWs, or where a Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) needs\r\nto send a PW status message directly to a far-end T-PE.  The mechanism\r\nallows PW Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) message\r\nmapping and PW redundancy to operate on static PWs.  This document\r\nalso updates RFC 5885 in the case when Bi-directional Forwarding \r\nDetection (BFD) is used to convey PW status-signaling information.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5885"],"updated_by":["RFC7274"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6478","errata_url":null}
