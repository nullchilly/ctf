There is a need for the\r\nability to have basic security services defined for this data format.\r\nThis document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)\r\nprotocol.  This specification describes how to create and process\r\nsignatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR\r\nfor serialization.  This specification additionally describes how to\r\nrepresent cryptographic keys using CBOR.","pub_date":"July 2017","keywords":["CoAP","ECC","Elliptic Curve"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9052","RFC9053"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8152","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8152"}
