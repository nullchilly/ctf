Saad"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"24","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Multiprotocol Label Switching","abstract":"As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, the number of Label\r\nSwitched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements has\r\nincreased.  Various implementation recommendations have been proposed\r\nto manage the resulting increase in the amount of control-plane state\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nHowever, those changes have had no effect on the number of labels\r\nthat a transit Label Switching Router (LSR) has to support in the\r\nforwarding plane.  That number is governed by the number of LSPs\r\ntransiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly related to the\r\ntotal LSP state in the control plane.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the\r\nlabel space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control-plane\r\nscaling on that node.  It introduces the notion of preinstalled\r\n'per-TE link labels' that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that\r\ntraverse these TE links.  This approach significantly reduces the\r\nforwarding-plane state required to support a large number of LSPs.\r\nThis couples the feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with\r\nthe simplicity of the Segment Routing (SR) MPLS forwarding plane.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":["Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels","TE link labels","RSVP-TE shared labels"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8577","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8577"}
