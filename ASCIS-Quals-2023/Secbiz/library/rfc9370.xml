      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange
  Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take
  place while computing a shared secret during a Security Association
  (SA) setup.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being
  established.  It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange,
  IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA
  is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-3">This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from
  "Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)" to "Key Exchange Method (KE)" and
  renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from "Diffie-Hellman
  Group Num" to "Key Exchange Method".  It also renames an IANA
  registry for this Transform Type from "Transform Type 4 - Diffie-
  Hellman Group Transform IDs" to "Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange
  Method Transform IDs".  These changes generalize key exchange
  algorithms that can be used in IKEv2.</t>

  the Diffie-Hellman (DH) or the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
  algorithm, which shall be referred to as "(EC)DH" collectively, to
  establish a shared secret between an initiator and a responder.  The
  security of the (EC)DH algorithms relies on the difficulty to solve a
  discrete logarithm problem in multiplicative (and, respectively,
  elliptic curve) groups when the order of the group parameter is large
  enough.  While solving such a problem remains infeasible with current
  computing power, it is believed that general-purpose quantum
  computers will be able to solve this problem, implying that the
  security of IKEv2 is compromised.  There are, however, a number of
  cryptosystems that are conjectured to be resistant to quantum-computer attacks.  This family of cryptosystems is known as "post-quantum cryptography" (or "PQC").  It is sometimes also referred to as
  "quantum-safe cryptography" (or "QSC") or "quantum-resistant cryptography"
  (or "QRC").</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">It is essential to have the ability to perform one or more post-quantum key exchanges in conjunction with an (EC)DH key exchange so that the resulting
  shared key is resistant to quantum-computer attacks.   Since there is currently no post-quantum key exchange that
  is as well-studied as (EC)DH, performing multiple key exchanges with
  different post-quantum algorithms along with the well-established
  classical key-exchange algorithms addresses this concern, since the
  overall security is at least as strong as each individual primitive. </t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-1">This document describes a method to perform multiple successive key
        exchanges in IKEv2. This method allows integration of PQC in IKEv2,
        while maintaining backward compatibility, to derive a set of IKE keys
        that is resistant to quantum-computer attacks.  This extension allows
        the negotiation of one or more PQC algorithms to exchange data, in
        addition to the existing (EC)DH key exchange data.  It is believed
        that the feature of using more than one post-quantum algorithm is
        important, as many of these algorithms are relatively new, and there may
        be a need to hedge the security risk with multiple key exchange data
        from several distinct PQC algorithms.

        initiated using a smaller, possibly classical primitive, such as

        IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges are carried out, each of which contains an
        additional key exchange.  As the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange is
        encrypted, the IKE fragmentation protocol <xref target="RFC7383" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7383"/> can be used. The IKE SK_* values are updated after

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-1"> Most post-quantum key agreement algorithms are relatively new.
        Thus, they are not fully trusted.  There are also many proposed
        algorithms that have different trade-offs and that rely on different
        hard problems.  The concern is that some of these hard problems may
        turn out to be easier to solve than anticipated; thus, the key
        agreement algorithm may not be as secure as expected.

A hybrid solution, when multiple key exchanges are performed and the
calculated shared key depends on all of them, allows us to deal with
this uncertainty by combining a classical key exchange with a
post-quantum one, as well as leaving open the possibility of
combining it with multiple post-quantum key exchanges.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-2"> In order to be able to use IKE fragmentation <xref target="RFC7383" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7383"/> for those key exchanges that may
        have long public keys, this specification utilizes the
        IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange defined in <xref target="RFC9242" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9242"/>.  The initial IKE_SA_INIT messages do not have any
        inherent fragmentation support within IKE. However, IKE_SA_INIT
        messages can include a relatively short KE payload.  The additional
        key exchanges are performed using IKE_INTERMEDIATE messages that
        follow the IKE_SA_INIT exchange. This is to allow the standard IKE
        fragmentation mechanisms (which cannot be used in IKE_SA_INIT) to be
        available for the potentially large Key Exchange payloads with
        post-quantum algorithm data.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-3"> Note that this document assumes that each key exchange method
        requires one round trip and consumes exactly one IKE_INTERMEDIATE
        exchange.  This assumption is valid for all classic key exchange
        methods defined so far and for all post-quantum methods currently
        known.  For hypothetical future key exchange methods that require
        multiple round trips to complete, a separate document should define
        how such methods are split into several IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-4"> In order to minimize communication overhead, only the key shares
        that are agreed upon are actually exchanged.  To negotiate
        additional key exchanges, seven new Transform Types are defined.  These
        transforms and Transform Type 4 share the same Transform IDs.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-5"> It is assumed that new Transform Type 4 identifiers will be
        assigned later for various post-quantum key exchanges <xref target="IKEV2TYPE4ID" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IKEV2TYPE4ID"/>.  This specification does not
        make a distinction between classical (EC)DH and post-quantum key
        exchanges, nor between post-quantum algorithms that are true key
        exchanges and post-quantum algorithms that act as key transport
        mechanisms: all are treated equivalently by the protocol.  This
        document renames a field in the Key Exchange Payload from
        "Diffie-Hellman Group Num" to "Key Exchange Method". This document also
        renames Transform Type 4 from "Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)" to "Key
        Exchange Method (KE)". The corresponding renaming to the IANA registry
        is described in <xref target="IANA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-6"> The fact that newly defined transforms share the same registry for
        possible Transform IDs with Transform Type 4 allows additional key
        exchanges to be of any type: either post-quantum or classical
        (EC)DH.  This approach allows any combination of the defined key
        exchange methods to take place.  This also allows IKE peers to perform
        a single post-quantum key exchange in the IKE_SA_INIT without
        additional key exchanges, provided that the IP fragmentation is not an
        issue and that hybrid key exchange is not needed.

        negotiation rules: it selects a single transform of each type and

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-1"> Multiple key exchanges are negotiated using the standard IKEv2
          mechanism via SA payload.  For this purpose, seven new transform
          types are defined: Additional Key Exchange 1 (ADDKE1) with IANA-assigned value
          6, Additional Key Exchange 2 (ADDKE2) (7), Additional Key Exchange 3 (ADDKE3) (8),
          Additional Key Exchange 4 (ADDKE4) (9), Additional Key Exchange 5 (ADDKE5) (10),

          They are collectively called "Additional Key Exchange (ADDKE)
          Transform Types" in this document and have slightly different semantics
          than the existing IKEv2 Transform Types.  They are interpreted as an
          indication of additional key exchange methods that peers agree to
          perform in a series of IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges following the
          IKE_SA_INIT exchange.  The allowed Transform IDs for these transform
          types are the same as the IDs for Transform Type 4, so they all
          share a single IANA registry for Transform IDs.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-2">The key exchange method negotiated via Transform Type 4 always

          Transform Types.  This is so that the key exchange negotiated using Additional
          Key Exchange i always precedes that of Additional Key Exchange i +
          1. Each additional key exchange method <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be fully

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-3">With these semantics, note that ADDKE
          Transform Types are not associated with any particular type of key
          exchange and do not have any Transform IDs that are specific per
          Transform Type IANA registry.  Instead, they all share a single
          registry for Transform IDs, namely "Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform
          IDs".  All key exchange
          algorithms (both classical or post-quantum) should be added to this
          registry.  This approach gives peers flexibility in defining the
          ways they want to combine different key exchange methods.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-4"> When forming a proposal, the initiator adds transforms for the
          IKE_SA_INIT exchange using Transform Type 4.  In most cases, they
          will contain classical (EC)DH key exchange methods, but that is not
          a requirement.  Additional key exchange methods are proposed using
          ADDKE Transform Types.  All of these transform
          types are optional; the initiator is free to select any of them for
          proposing additional key exchange methods.  Consequently, if none of
          the ADDKE Transform Types are included in the proposal,
          then this proposal indicates the performing of standard IKEv2, as

          algorithms (those with an identical Transform ID and attributes),
          except for the Transform ID of NONE.  An algorithm is represented as
          a transform. In some cases, the transform could include a set of
          associated attributes that define details of the algorithm. In this
          case, two transforms can be the same, but the attributes must be
          different.   Additionally, the order of the attributes does not
   affect the equality of the algorithm, so the following two
   transforms define the same algorithm:
   "ID=alg1, ATTR1=attr1, ATTR2=attr2" and
   "ID=alg1, ATTR2=attr2, ATTR1=attr1". If the
          responder is unable to select algorithms that are not duplicated for each
          proposed key exchange (either because the proposal contains too few
          choices or due to the local policy restrictions on using the

          the message with an error notification of type NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.
          If the responder's message contains one or more duplicated choices,

          exchange as failed.  The initiator <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> initiate
          any IKE_INTERMEDIATE (or IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE) exchanges so that no new
          SA is created.  If this happens in the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange,

  In
          this case, the message may reach the responder when it has already
          deleted the associated state, following the advice above.  If the
          responder receives an IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE message for which it does not
          have a key exchange state, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> send back a new

          time period between IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges appeared to be too
          long from the responder's point of view, e.g., due to a temporary

          the colliding CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges. The IKE SA (or pair of
          Child SAs) created by the exchange in which the smallest

          this reason, if additional key exchanges are negotiated in the
          CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange in which the smallest nonce is used, then,
          because there is nothing to delete yet, the initiator of this

            have to wait for the subsequent CREATE_CHILD_SA request to
            determine whether or not the initiator's request is appropriate
            for its local policy.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.5.1-3">The support for childless IKE SA is not negotiated, but it is
            the responder that indicates the support for this mode.  As such,
            the responder cannot enforce that the initiator use this mode.
            Therefore, it is entirely possible that the initiator does not
            support this extension and sends IKE_AUTH request as per <xref target="RFC7296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7296"/> instead of <xref target="RFC6023" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6023"/>.  In this case, the responder
            may respond with an error that is not fatal, such as the NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN

            algorithm in Transform Type 4 in order to mitigate the risk of
            quantum attack. </t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">The extension in this document is intended to mitigate two possible
      threats in IKEv2: the compromise of (EC)DH key exchange using
      Shor's algorithm while remaining backward compatible and the potential
      compromise of existing or future PQC key exchange algorithms.  To
      address the former threat, this extension allows the establishment of a
      shared secret by using multiple key exchanges: typically, one classical
      (EC)DH and the other one post-quantum algorithm.  In order to address
      the latter threat, multiple key exchanges using a post-quantum algorithm
      can be performed to form the shared key.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">Unlike key exchange methods (Transform Type 4), the Encryption
      Algorithm (Transform Type 1), the Pseudorandom Function (Transform Type
      2), and the Integrity Algorithm (Transform Type 3) are not susceptible
      to Shor's algorithm.  However, they are susceptible to Grover's attack
      <xref target="GROVER" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GROVER"/>, which allows a quantum
      computer to perform a brute force key search, using quadratically fewer
      steps than the classical counterpart.  Simply increasing the key length
      can mitigate this attack.  It was previously believed that one needed to
      double the key length of these algorithms.  However, there are a number
      of factors that suggest that it is quite unlikely to achieve the
      quadratic speedup using Grover's algorithm.  According to NIST <xref target="NISTPQCFAQ" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NISTPQCFAQ"/>, current applications can
      continue using an AES algorithm with the minimum key length of 128 bits.
      Nevertheless, if the data needs to remain secure for many years to come,
      one may want to consider using a longer key size for the algorithms in
      Transform Types 1-3.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">SKEYSEED is calculated from shared SK(x), using an algorithm defined
    	in Transform Type 2.  While a quantum attacker may learn the value
    	of SK(x), if this value is obtained by means of a classical key exchange,
    	other SK(x) values generated by means of a post-quantum algorithm
    	ensure that the final SKEYSEED is not compromised.  This assumes that
    	the algorithm defined in the Transform Type 2 is quantum resistant.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">The ordering of the additional key exchanges should not matter in
      general, as only the final shared secret is of interest.  Nonetheless,
      because the strength of the running shared secret increases with every
      additional key exchange, an implementer may want to first perform the
      most secure method (in some metrics) followed by less secure
      methods.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-5">The main focus of this document is to prevent a passive attacker from
  performing a "harvest-and-decrypt" attack: in other words, attackers that record
  messages exchanged today and proceed to decrypt them once they have access
  to cryptographically relevant quantum computers.  This attack is prevented due to the hybrid
        nature of the key exchange.  Other attacks involving an active attacker
        using a quantum-computer are not completely solved by this
        document.  This is for two reasons:</t>
      <ul bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" spacing="normal" pn="section-4-6">
        <li pn="section-4-6.1">The first reason is that the authentication step remains
        classical.  In particular, the authenticity of the SAs established
        under IKEv2 is protected by using a pre-shared key or digital signature
        algorithms.  While the pre-shared key option, provided the key is
        long enough, is post-quantum secure, the other algorithms are not.   Moreover,
        in implementations where scalability is a requirement, the pre-shared
        key method may not be suitable.  Post-quantum authenticity may be
        provided by using a post-quantum digital signature.
      </li>
        <li pn="section-4-6.2">Secondly, it should be noted that the purpose of post-quantum algorithms is
        to provide resistance to attacks mounted in the future.  The current
        threat is that encrypted sessions are subject to eavesdropping and are
        archived with decryption by quantum computers at some
        point in the future.  Until quantum computers become available, there
        is no point in attacking the authenticity of a connection because
        there are no possibilities for exploitation.  These only occur at
        the time of the connection, for example, by mounting an on-path
        attack.  Consequently, there is less urgency for
        post-quantum authenticity compared to post-quantum confidentiality.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-7"> Performing multiple key exchanges while establishing an IKE SA
      increases the responder's susceptibility to DoS attacks because of an
      increased amount of resources needed before the initiator is
      authenticated.  This is especially true for post-quantum key exchange
      methods, where many of them are more memory and/or CPU intensive than
      the classical counterparts.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-8"> Responders may consider recommendations from <xref target="RFC8019" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8019"/> to deal with increased DoS-attack susceptibility.  It
      is also possible that the responder only agrees to create an initial IKE SA
      without performing additional key exchanges if the initiator includes
      such an option in its proposals.  Then, peers immediately rekey the
      initial IKE SA with the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange, and additional key
      exchanges are performed via the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges.  In this
      case, at the point when resource-intensive operations are required, the
      peers have already authenticated each other.  However, in the context of
      hybrid post-quantum key exchanges, this scenario would leave the initial
      IKE SA (and initial Child SA, if it is created) unprotected against
      quantum computers. Nevertheless, the rekeyed IKE SA (and Child SAs that
      will be created over it) will have a full protection.  This is similar
      to the scenario described in <xref target="RFC8784" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8784"/>.
      Depending on the arrangement and peers' policy, this scenario may or may
      not be appropriate.  For example, in the G-IKEv2 protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="G-IKEV2"/>, the cryptographic
      materials are sent from the group controller to the group members when
      the initial IKE SA is created.

This exchange can be used for transferring large amounts of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment.  An example of the need to do this is using key exchange methods resistant to Quantum Computers (QCs) for IKE SA establishment.  The Intermediate Exchange makes it possible to use the existing IKE fragmentation mechanism (which cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange), helping to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE messages if they need to be sent before IKEv2 SA is established.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more round trips and consequently latency.</t>
              <t indent="0">To re-establish security associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.</t>
              <t indent="0">In order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.</t>
              <t indent="0">A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client or in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to cryptographic algorithms deployed widely today.  The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available.  It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2.2.2">

        With the objective of not introducing unnecessary notify payloads, a
        method to communicate the hybrid post-quantum proposal in the KE
        payload during the first pass of the protocol exchange was considered.
        Unfortunately, this design is susceptible to the following downgrade
        attack.  Consider the scenario where there is an on-path attacker
        sitting between an initiator and a responder. Through the SAi payload, the
        initiator proposes using a hybrid post-quantum group and, as a
        fallback, a Diffie-Hellman group; and through the KEi payload, the
        initiator proposes a list of hybrid post-quantum proposals and
        policies.  The on-path attacker intercepts this traffic and replies
        with N(INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD), suggesting a downgrade to the fallback
        Diffie-Hellman group instead.  The initiator then resends the same SAi
        payload and the KEi payload containing the public value of the
        fallback Diffie-Hellman group.  Note that the attacker may forward the
        second IKE_SA_INIT message only to the responder. Therefore, at this
        point in time, the responder will not have the information that the
        initiator prefers the hybrid group. Of course, it is possible for the
        responder to have a policy to reject an IKE_SA_INIT message that (a)
        offers a hybrid group but does not offer the corresponding public value
        in the KEi payload and (b) the responder has not specifically
        acknowledged that it does not support the requested hybrid group.
        However, the checking of this policy introduces unnecessary protocol
        complexity.  Therefore, in order to fully prevent any downgrade
        attacks, using a KE payload alone is not sufficient, and the initiator
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always indicate its preferred post-quantum
        proposals and policies in a notify payload in the subsequent
        IKE_SA_INIT messages following an N(INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD) response.</t>

          post-quantum public values</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2.3.2">
        Semantically, it makes sense to use a new payload type, which mimics
        the SA payload, to carry a hybrid proposal.  Likewise, another new
        payload type that mimics the KE payload could be used to transport
        hybrid public value.  Although, in theory, a new payload type could be
        made backward compatible by not setting its critical flag as per
        <xref target="RFC7296" sectionFormat="of" section="2.5" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.5" derivedContent="RFC7296"/>, it is
        believed that it may not be that simple in practice.  Since the
        original release of IKEv2 in RFC 4306, no new payload type has ever
        been proposed; therefore, this creates a potential risk of having a
        backward-compatibility issue from nonconformant IKEv2
        implementations.  Since there appears to be no other compelling
        advantages apart from a semantic one, the existing Transform Type and
        notify payloads are used instead.

        One way to transport the negotiated hybrid public payload, which
        contains one classical Diffie-Hellman public value and one or more
        post-quantum public values, is to bundle these into a single KE
        payload.  Alternatively, these could also be transported in a single
        new hybrid public value payload. However, following the same reasoning
        as above may not be a good idea from a backward-compatibility
        perspective.  Using a single KE payload would require encoding or
        formatting to be defined so that both peers are able to compose and
        extract the individual public values.  However, it is believed that it
        is cleaner to send the hybrid public values in multiple KE payloads:
        one for each group or algorithm.  Furthermore, at this point in the
        protocol exchange, both peers should have indicated support for
        handling multiple KE payloads.

        The handling of large IKE_SA_INIT messages has been one of the most
        challenging tasks.  A number of approaches have been considered,
        and the two prominent ones that have been discarded are outlined as
        follows.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2.5.3">
        The first approach is to treat the entire IKE_SA_INIT message as
        a stream of bytes, which is then split into a number of
        fragments, each of which is wrapped onto a payload that will fit
        into the size of the network MTU.  The payload that wraps each
        fragment has a new payload type, and it is envisaged that this new
        payload type will not cause a backward-compatibility issue because,
        at this stage of the protocol, both peers should have indicated
        support of fragmentation in the first pass of the IKE_SA_INIT
        exchange.  The negotiation of fragmentation is performed using a
        notify payload, which also defines supporting parameters, such as
        the size of fragment in octets and the fragment identifier.  The
        new payload that wraps each fragment of the messages in this
        exchange is assigned the same fragment identifier. Furthermore, it
        also has other parameters, such as a fragment index and total
        number of fragments.  This approach has been discarded due to
        its blanket approach to fragmentation.  In cases where only a few
        payloads need to be fragmented, this approach appears to be
        overly complicated.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2.5.4">
        Another idea that has been discarded is fragmenting an individual
        payload without introducing a new payload type.  The idea is to
        use the 9-th bit (the bit after the critical flag in the RESERVED
        field) in the generic payload header as a flag to mark that this
        payload is fragmented.  As an example, if a KE payload is to be
        fragmented, it may look as follows.

        When the flag F is set, the current KE payload is a
        fragment of a larger KE payload.  The Payload Length field denotes
        the size of this payload fragment in octets: including the size of
        the generic payload header.  The 2-octet RESERVED field
        following Diffie-Hellman Group Number was to be used as a fragment
        identifier to help the assembly and disassembly of fragments.  The
        Fragment Index and Total Fragments fields are self-explanatory.
        The Total KE Payload Data Length indicates the size of the
        assembled KE payload data in octets.  Finally, the actual fragment
        is carried in Fragment KE Payload field.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2.5.7">
        This approach has been discarded because it is believed that the
        working group may not want to use the RESERVED field to change the
        format of a packet, and that implementers may not like the added
        complexity from checking the fragmentation flag in each received
        payload. More importantly, fragmenting the messages in this way
     may leave the system to be more prone to denial-of-service (DoS)
     attacks.  This issue can be solved using IKE_INTERMEDIATE <xref target="RFC9242" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9242"/> to
     transport the large post-quantum key exchange payloads and using
     the generic IKEv2 fragmentation protocol
        <xref target="RFC7383" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7383"/>.</t>

        As discussed before, each group identifier is used to distinguish a
        post-quantum algorithm.  Further classification could be made on a
        particular post-quantum algorithm by assigning an additional value
        alongside the group identifier.  This sub-identifier value may be used
        to assign different security-parameter sets to a given post-quantum
        algorithm.  However, this level of detail does not fit the principles
        of the document where it should deal with generic hybrid key exchange
        protocol and not a specific ciphersuite.  Furthermore, there are
        enough Diffie-Hellman group identifiers should this be required in the
        future.
