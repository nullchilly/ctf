The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying\r\nmaterial used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is\r\naccessible to the Media Distributor, while the keying material used\r\nfor end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the\r\nMedia Distributor.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["PERC","SRTP","RTP","DTLS","DTLS-SRTP","DTLS tunnel","conferencing","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9185","errata_url":null}
