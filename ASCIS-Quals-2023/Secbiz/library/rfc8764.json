From\r\n2005 onwards, LLQ was implemented in Apple products including Mac OS\r\nX, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.  In 2020,\r\nthe LLQ protocol was superseded by the IETF Standards Track RFC 8765,\r\n\"DNS Push Notifications\", which builds on experience gained with the\r\nLLQ protocol to create a superior replacement. \r\n\r\nThe existing LLQ protocol deployed and used from 2005 to 2020 is\r\ndocumented here to give background regarding the operational\r\nexperience that informed the development of DNS Push Notifications,\r\nand to help facilitate a smooth transition from LLQ to DNS Push\r\nNotifications.","pub_date":"June 2020","keywords":["Async","Asynchronous","Change Notification","Push Notification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8764","errata_url":null}
