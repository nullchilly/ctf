Increasingly, MPLS and GMPLS networks are being extended\r\nfrom single domain scope to multi-domain environments.\r\n\r\nVarious schemes and processes have been developed to establish Label\r\nSwitched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments.  These are\r\ndiscussed in RFC 4726: \"A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol\r\nLabel Switching Traffic Engineering\".\r\n\r\nThis document analyzes the application of these techniques to\r\nprotection and recovery in multi-domain networks.  The main focus for\r\nthis document is on establishing end-to-end diverse Traffic\r\nEngineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain networks.  This memo provides\r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2008","keywords":["mpls","gmpls","multi-domain environment","end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering LSPs"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5298","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5298"}
