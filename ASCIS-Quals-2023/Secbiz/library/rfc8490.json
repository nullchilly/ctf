DSO messages communicate operations within persistent\r\nstateful sessions using Type Length Value (TLV) syntax.  Three TLVs\r\nare defined that manage session timeouts, termination, and encryption\r\npadding, and a framework is defined for extensions to enable new\r\nstateful operations.  This document updates RFC 1035 by adding a new\r\nDNS header OPCODE that has both different message semantics and a new\r\nresult code.  This document updates RFC 7766 by redefining a session,\r\nproviding new guidance on connection reuse, and providing a new\r\nmechanism for handling session idle timeouts.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1035","RFC7766"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8490","errata_url":null}
