This document\r\nspecifies an extension to DS-Lite called \"Lightweight 4over6\", which\r\nmoves the Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) function from\r\nthe centralized DS-Lite tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client\r\nlocated in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This removes the\r\nrequirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel\r\nconcentrator and reduces the amount of centralized state that must be\r\nheld to a per-subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT\r\nfunction and make IPv4 address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4\r\naddresses are allocated to the CPEs.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["DS-Lite","address sharing","address exhaustion","aplusp","A+P","IPv4 service continuity","IPv4 over IPv6 connectivity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7596","errata_url":null}
