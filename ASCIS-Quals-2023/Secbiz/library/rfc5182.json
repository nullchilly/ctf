The server will send the list\r\nof found messages to the client; after that, the client will have to\r\nparse the list, reformat it, and send it back to the server.  The\r\nclient can't pipeline the SEARCH command with the subsequent command,\r\nand, as a result, the server might not be able to perform some\r\noptimizations.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an IMAP extension that allows a client to tell\r\na server to use the result of a SEARCH (or Unique Identifier (UID)\r\nSEARCH) command as an input to any subsequent command.
