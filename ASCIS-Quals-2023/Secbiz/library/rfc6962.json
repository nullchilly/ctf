The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to\r\nhonor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing\r\nCAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.\r\n\r\nLogs are network services that implement the protocol operations for\r\nsubmissions and queries that are defined in this document.","pub_date":"June 2013","keywords":["TLS certificates"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9162"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6962","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6962"}
