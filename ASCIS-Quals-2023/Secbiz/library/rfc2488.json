Sanchez"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"19","pub_status":"BEST CURRENT PRACTICE","status":"BEST CURRENT PRACTICE","source":"TCP Over Satellite","abstract":" The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable delivery of data across any network path, including network paths containing satellite channels.  While TCP works over satellite channels there are several IETF standardized mechanisms that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the available capacity of the network path.  This document outlines some of these TCP mitigations.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
