First, the simplicity of\r\nadministering networks through the combination of NAT and DHCP has\r\nincreasingly lead to the deployment of multi-level inter-connected\r\nprivate networks involving overlapping private IP address spaces.\r\nSecond, the proliferation of private networks in enterprises, hotels\r\nand conferences, and the wide-spread use of Virtual Private Networks\r\n(VPNs) to access an enterprise intranet from remote locations has\r\nincreasingly lead to overlapping private IP address space between\r\nremote and corporate networks.  This document does not dismiss these\r\nunconventional scenarios as invalid, but recognizes them as real and\r\noffers recommendations to help ensure these deployments can\r\nfunction without a meltdown.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["network address translator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5684","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5684"}
