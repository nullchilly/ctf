It defines a\r\nnew SDP protocol identifier, 'TCP\/TLS'.  It also defines the syntax\r\nand semantics for an SDP 'fingerprint' attribute that identifies the\r\ncertificate that will be presented for the TLS session.  This\r\nmechanism allows media transport over TLS connections to be\r\nestablished securely, so long as the integrity of session\r\ndescriptions is assured.\r\n\r\nThis document extends and updates RFC 4145.
