In the\r\nsplit scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is authorized by a\r\ndifferent service authorizer than the network access authorizer.  In\r\nthe integrated scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is\r\nauthorized by the same service authorizer as the network access\r\nservice authorizer.
