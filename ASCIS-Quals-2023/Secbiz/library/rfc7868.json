EIGRP is a\r\nrouting protocol based on Distance Vector technology.  The specific\r\nalgorithm used is called \"DUAL\", a Diffusing Update Algorithm as\r\nreferenced in \"Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations\"\r\n(Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993).  The algorithm and procedures were\r\nresearched, developed, and simulated by SRI International.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7868","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7868"}
