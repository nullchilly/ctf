This allows constructing a feedback loop to\r\nenable application adaptation and monitoring, among other uses.  The\r\nbasic reporting mechanisms offered by RTCP are generic, yet quite\r\npowerful and suffice to cover a range of uses.  This document\r\nprovides guidelines on extending RTCP if those basic mechanisms prove\r\ninsufficient.
