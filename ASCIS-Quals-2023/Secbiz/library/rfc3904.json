Unmanaged networks typically correspond to home networks or small office networks.  A companion paper analyzes out the requirements for mechanisms needed in various transition scenarios of these networks to IPv6.  Starting from this analysis, we evaluate the suitability of mechanisms that have already been specified, proposed, or deployed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
