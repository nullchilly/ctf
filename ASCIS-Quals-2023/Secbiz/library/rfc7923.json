Based on\r\ncriteria negotiated as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed\r\nto targeted recipients.  Such a capability eliminates the need for\r\nperiodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a\r\nfunctional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network\r\nConfiguration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF).  Such a service can\r\nbe summarized as a \"pub\/sub\" service for YANG datastore updates.\r\nBeyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various\r\nrefinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of\r\nobject updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a\r\nsubtree, and delivery QoS guarantees.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["pub\/sub","push updates"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7923","errata_url":null}
