   Domain of Activity

      The Internet Engineering and Planning Group (IEPG) is a group
      principally comprised of Internet Service Operators.

   Goal

      The common objective of the group is to promote a technically
      coordinated operational environment of the Global Internet.

   Activities

      The activities of the IEPG will be within the following areas:

     -  To facilitate the operations and management of Global Internet
        services,

     -  To promote the introduction of new Internet services within the
        Global Internet, and

     -  Liaison with related Internet Operations groups and liaison with
        technical development groups.

      Explicitly the IEPG is not a group which will conduct activities
      of a technical developmental nature.
