A standardized mechanism to\r\ndetermine the identity of a name server responding to a particular\r\nquery would be useful, particularly as a diagnostic aid for\r\nadministrators.  Existing ad hoc mechanisms for addressing this need\r\nhave some shortcomings, not the least of which is the lack of prior\r\nanalysis of exactly how such a mechanism should be designed and\r\ndeployed.  This document describes the existing convention used in\r\nsome widely deployed implementations of the DNS protocol, including\r\nadvantages and disadvantages, and discusses some attributes of an\r\nimproved mechanism.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2007","keywords":["domain name service","dns name server"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4892","errata_url":null}
