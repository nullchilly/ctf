TRILL switches\r\nmaintain a cache of IP \/ Media Access Control (MAC) address \/ Data\r\nLabel bindings that are learned from ARP\/ND requests and responses\r\nthat pass through them.  In many cases, this cache allows an edge\r\nRouting Bridge (RBridge) to avoid flooding an ARP\/ND request by\r\neither responding to it directly or encapsulating it and unicasting\r\nit.  Such optimization reduces packet flooding over a TRILL campus.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["proxy","RARP","duplicate address","DAD","DHCP","flooding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8302","errata_url":null}
