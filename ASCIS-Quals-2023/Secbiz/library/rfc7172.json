The TRILL base protocol\r\nstandard supports the labeling of TRILL Data packets with up to 4K IDs.\r\nHowever, there are applications that require a larger number of labels\r\nproviding configurable isolation of data.  This document updates RFC\r\n6325 by specifying optional extensions to the TRILL base protocol to\r\nsafely accomplish this.  These extensions, called fine-grained\r\nlabeling, are primarily intended for use in large data centers, that\r\nis, those with more than 4K users requiring configurable data\r\nisolation from each other.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["TRILL","VLAN","Fine-Grained","Label"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6325"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7172","errata_url":null}
