The Simple\r\nInternet Protocol was the basis for one of the candidates for the\r\nIETF's Next Generation (IPng) work that became IPv6.\r\n\r\nThe publication date of the original Internet-Draft was November 10,\r\n1992.  It is presented here substantially unchanged and is neither a\r\ncomplete document nor intended to be implementable.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph that follows is the Abstract from the original draft.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a new version of IP called SIP, the Simple\r\nInternet Protocol.  It also describes the changes needed to ICMP,\r\nIGMP, and transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, in order to work\r\nwith SIP.  A companion document [SIP-ADDR] describes the addressing\r\nand routing aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration,\r\nhost and subnet mobility, and multicast.","pub_date":"December 2018","keywords":["IPv6","IPng"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8507","errata_url":null}
