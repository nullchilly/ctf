This\r\ndocument describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects,\r\nattributes, and operations that is independent of encoding and\r\ntransport.  The model consists of several objects, including Printers\r\nand Jobs.  Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.\r\n\r\nIPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer\r\ncapabilities; submit Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print\r\nJobs and Printers; and cancel, hold, and release Print Jobs.  IPP\r\nsemantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.\r\n\r\nSecurity, internationalization, and directory issues are also\r\naddressed by the model and semantics.  The IPP message encoding and\r\ntransport are described in \"Internet Printing Protocol\/1.1: Encoding                                  \r\nand Transport\" (RFC 8010).\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.","pub_date":"January 2017","keywords":["IPP","Printer","PWG","Printer Working Group"],"obsoletes":["RFC2911","RFC3381","RFC3382"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["STD0092"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8011","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8011"}
