However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay,\r\netc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access through\r\nmultiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would\r\nbe configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses.  This\r\ndocument proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register\r\nand use multiple care-of addresses.  The extensions proposed in this\r\ndocument can be used by mobile routers using the NEMO (Network\r\nMobility) Basic Support protocol as well.
