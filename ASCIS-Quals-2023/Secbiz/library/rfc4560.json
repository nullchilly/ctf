When managing a\r\nnetwork, it is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results\r\nof ping or traceroute operations when they are performed at a remote\r\nhost.  A lookup capability is defined in order to enable resolution of either\r\nan IP address to an DNS name or a DNS name to an IP address at a\r\nremote host.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for performing\r\nremote ping or traceroute operations.
