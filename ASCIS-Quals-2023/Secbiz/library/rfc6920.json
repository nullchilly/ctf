It\r\nspecifies a new URI scheme for this purpose, a way to map these to\r\nHTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable formats for these names.\r\nThe various formats are designed to support, but not require, a\r\nstrong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object\r\nmay be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it.  The\r\nreason for this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs\r\nin URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other\r\nuses of hash outputs in protocols.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":["Cryptography","URI","Information Centric Networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6920","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6920"}
