Servers\r\nthat support these interfaces are referred to as Secure Object\r\nDelivery Protocol (SODP) servers. The intended audience for this\r\nprofile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key\r\nmanagement services from NSA-operated SODP servers.  Interfaces\r\nsupported by SODP servers include Enrollment over Secure Transport\r\n(EST) and its extensions as well as Certificate Management over CMS\r\n(CMC).\r\n\r\nThis profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and\r\noperation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP\r\n800-59). It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that\r\nprocess high-value information. It is made publicly available for use\r\nby developers and operators of these and any other system\r\ndeployments.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["CNSA","NSS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9152","errata_url":null}
