No DetNet-specific encapsulation is defined\r\nto support IP flows; instead, the existing IP-layer and higher-layer\r\nprotocol header information is used to support flow identification\r\nand DetNet service delivery.  This document builds on the DetNet\r\narchitecture (RFC 8655) and data plane framework (RFC 8938).","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["Application","Endpoint","Service Sub-layer","Forwarding Sub-layer"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8939","errata_url":null}
