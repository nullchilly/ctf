Some sites are interested in running multiple\r\nservers in such a way as to provide increased availability in case of\r\nserver failure.  In order for this to work reliably, the cooperating\r\nprimary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent database of\r\nthe lease information.  RFC 3315 allows for, but does not define, any\r\nredundancy or failover mechanisms.  This document outlines\r\nrequirements for DHCPv6 failover, enumerates related problems, and\r\ndiscusses the proposed scope of work to be conducted.  This document\r\ndoes not define a DHCPv6 failover protocol.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["DHCPv6","Failover"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7031","errata_url":null}
