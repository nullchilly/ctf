In case of resources with larger or complex\r\ndata, or in situations where resource continuity is required,\r\nreplacing or requesting the whole resource is undesirable.  Several\r\napplications using CoAP need to access parts of the resources.\r\n\r\nThis specification defines the new CoAP methods, FETCH, PATCH, and\r\niPATCH, which are used to access and update parts of a resource.","pub_date":"April 2017","keywords":["CoAP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8132","errata_url":null}
