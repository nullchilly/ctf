PCE Communication\r\nProtocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful PCE usage are\r\ncovered in separate documents.","pub_date":"January 2017","keywords":["Stateful PCE","Applicability"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8051","errata_url":null}
