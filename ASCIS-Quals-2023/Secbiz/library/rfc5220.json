In\r\nthat environment, end hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be\r\nrequired to use them selectively.  RFC 3484 defines default source\r\nand destination address selection rules and is implemented in a\r\nvariety of OSs.  But, it has been too difficult to use operationally\r\nfor several reasons.  In some environments where multiple prefixes are\r\nassigned on a single physical link, the host using the default\r\naddress selection rules will experience some trouble in\r\ncommunication.  This document describes the possible problems that\r\nend hosts could encounter in an environment with multiple prefixes.  This \r\nmemo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2008","keywords":["multiple prefixes"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5220","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5220"}
