A solution framework for supporting\r\nthis service in MPLS networks is described in RFC 7387, \"A Framework                               \r\nfor Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Service over a Multiprotocol Label                                      \r\nSwitching (MPLS) Network\".  This document discusses how those\r\nfunctional requirements can be met with a solution based on RFC 7432,\r\n\"BGP MPLS Based Ethernet VPN (EVPN)\", with some extensions and a\r\ndescription of how such a solution can offer a more efficient\r\nimplementation of these functions than that of RFC 7796,\r\n\"Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)\".\r\nThis document makes use of the most significant bit of the Tunnel Type\r\nfield (in the P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute)\r\ngoverned by the IANA registry created by RFC 7385; hence, it updates\r\nRFC 7385 accordingly.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7385"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8317","errata_url":null}
