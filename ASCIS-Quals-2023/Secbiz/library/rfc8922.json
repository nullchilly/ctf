This survey is not\r\nlimited to protocols developed within the scope or context of the\r\nIETF, and those included represent a superset of features a Transport\r\nServices system may need to support.","pub_date":"October 2020","keywords":["Transport Protocols","Transport Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8922","errata_url":null}
