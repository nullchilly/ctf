The network providing the\r\nsame type of service to any mobile host and any application running\r\non the host yields inefficiencies, as described in RFC 7333.  This\r\ndocument defines a new concept of enabling applications to influence\r\nthe network's mobility services (session continuity and\/or IP address\r\nreachability) on a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the\r\nnetworking stack's API to accommodate this concept.","pub_date":"October 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8653","errata_url":null}
