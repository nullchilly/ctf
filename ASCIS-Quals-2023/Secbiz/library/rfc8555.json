Thus, certification authorities\r\n(CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a\r\ncertificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the\r\ncertificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a\r\ncollection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol\r\nthat a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of\r\nverification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides\r\nfacilities for other certificate management functions, such as\r\ncertificate revocation.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["certificate","HTTPS","PKI","X.509"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8555","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8555"}
