Representing Sieves in XML is intended not\r\nas an alternate storage format for Sieve but rather as a means to\r\nfacilitate manipulation of scripts using XML tools.\r\n\r\nThe XML representation also defines additional elements that have no\r\ncounterparts in the regular Sieve language.  These elements are\r\nintended for use by graphical user interfaces and provide facilities\r\nfor labeling or grouping sections of a script so they can be\r\ndisplayed more conveniently.  These elements are represented as\r\nspecially structured comments in regular Sieve format.
