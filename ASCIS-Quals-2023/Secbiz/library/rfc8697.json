This grouping can then be used to define associations\r\nbetween sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes\r\n(such as configuration parameters or behaviors), and it is equally\r\napplicable to the stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and the\r\nstateless PCE.","pub_date":"January 2020","keywords":["PCE","PCEP","Association","Group"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8697","errata_url":null}
