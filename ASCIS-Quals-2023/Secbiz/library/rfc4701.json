Whether the DHCP server or the\r\nclients themselves perform the DNS updates, conflicts can arise.  To\r\nresolve such conflicts, RFC 4703 proposes storing client identifiers\r\nin the DNS to unambiguously associate domain names with the DHCP\r\nclients to which they refer.  This memo defines a distinct Resource\r\nRecord (RR) type for this purpose for use by DHCP clients and servers:\r\nthe \"DHCID\" RR.
