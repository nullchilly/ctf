The Intermediate Flow\r\nSelection Process may be located at an IP Flow Information Export\r\n(IPFIX) Exporter or Collector, or within an IPFIX Mediator.  It\r\nreduces the effort of post-processing Flow data and transferring Flow\r\nRecords.  This document describes motivations for using the\r\nIntermediate Flow Selection process and presents Intermediate Flow\r\nSelection techniques.  It provides an information model for\r\nconfiguring Intermediate Flow Selection Process techniques and\r\ndiscusses what information about an Intermediate Flow Selection\r\nProcess should be exported.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7014","errata_url":null}
