Crocker"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"15","pub_status":"BEST CURRENT PRACTICE","status":"BEST CURRENT PRACTICE","source":"Domain Name System Operations","abstract":"Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for constrained\r\ninteroperation of resource records.  Original uses of an underscore\r\ncharacter as a domain node name prefix were specified without the\r\nbenefit of an IANA registry.  This produced an entirely uncoordinated\r\nset of name-creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace.\r\nA registry for these names has now been defined by RFC 8552.\r\nHowever, the existing specifications that use underscored naming need\r\nto be modified in order to be in line with the new registry.  This\r\ndocument specifies those changes.  The changes preserve existing\r\nsoftware and operational practice, while adapting the specifications\r\nfor those practices to the newer underscore registry model.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["DNS","Domain Name System"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2782","RFC3263","RFC3529","RFC3620","RFC3832","RFC3887","RFC3958","RFC4120","RFC4227","RFC4386","RFC4387","RFC4976","RFC5026","RFC5328","RFC5389","RFC5415","RFC5518","RFC5555","RFC5617","RFC5679","RFC5766","RFC5780","RFC5804","RFC5864","RFC5928","RFC6120","RFC6186","RFC6376","RFC6733","RFC6763","RFC7208","RFC7489","RFC8145"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0222"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8553","errata_url":null}
