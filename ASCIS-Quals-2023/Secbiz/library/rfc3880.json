It is designed to be implementable on either network servers or user agents.  It is meant to be simple, extensible, easily edited by graphical clients, and independent of operating system or signalling protocol.  It is suitable for running on a server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, as it has no variables, loops, or ability to run external programs.
