However, the location and movement\r\nof the mobile node can be revealed by the IP addresses used in\r\nsignaling or data packets.  In this document, we consider the Mobile\r\nIPv6 location privacy problem described in RFC 4882, and propose\r\nefficient and secure techniques to protect location privacy of the\r\nmobile node.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility\r\nOptimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This document defines \r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["[--------]","mobopts"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5726","errata_url":null}
