The DTLS protocol provides communications\r\nprivacy for datagram protocols.  The protocol allows client\/server\r\napplications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent\r\neavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.  The DTLS protocol is\r\nbased on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and provides\r\nequivalent security guarantees.  Datagram semantics of the underlying\r\ntransport are preserved by the DTLS protocol.","pub_date":"April 2006","keywords":["dtls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6347"],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC5746","RFC7507"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4347","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4347"}
