One mechanism to minimize\r\ndisruption is to expose a shorter network path to the mobility event\r\nso that only the local network elements are aware of the changed IP\r\naddress and the remote peer is unaware of the changed IP address.\r\n\r\nThis document provides such an IP address mobility solution using\r\nTraversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN).  This is achieved by\r\nallowing a client to retain an allocation on the TURN server when the\r\nIP address of the client changes.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":["IP Address Mobility","VoIP","ICE","STUN","RTP","TUNNEL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8016","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8016"}
