In particular, together with its companion memos which describe the structure of management information along with the initial management information base, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for managing TCP\/IP-based internets and in particular, the Internet. This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community. TCP\/IP implementations in the Internet which are network manageable are expected to adopt and implement this specification.
