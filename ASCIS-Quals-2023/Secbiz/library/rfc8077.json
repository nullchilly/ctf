It is also possible to use\r\npseudowires to provide low-rate Time-Division Multiplexed and\r\nSynchronous Optical NETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled\r\nnetwork.  This document specifies a protocol for establishing and\r\nmaintaining the pseudowires, using extensions to the Label\r\nDistribution Protocol (LDP).  Procedures for encapsulating Layer 2\r\nPDUs are specified in other documents.\r\n\r\nThis document is a rewrite of RFC 4447 for publication as an\r\nInternet Standard.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC4447","RFC6723"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["STD0084"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8077","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8077"}
