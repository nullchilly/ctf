PIM-SM has defined an algorithm\r\nto choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned using various\r\nmechanisms.  This algorithm does not consider the PIM mode and the\r\nmechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a standard algorithm to deterministically\r\nchoose between several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group.\r\nThis document first explains the requirements to extend the\r\nGroup-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["[--------]","auto-RP BSR hash","algorithm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4601"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6226","errata_url":null}
