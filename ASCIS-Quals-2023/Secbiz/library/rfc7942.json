This will allow\r\nreviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents\r\nthat have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of\r\nvaluable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented\r\nprotocols more mature.\r\n\r\nThis process is not mandatory.  Authors of Internet-Drafts are\r\nencouraged to consider using the process for their documents, and\r\nworking groups are invited to think about applying the process to all\r\nof their protocol specifications.  This document obsoletes RFC 6982,\r\nadvancing it to a Best Current Practice.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6982"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0205"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7942","errata_url":null}
