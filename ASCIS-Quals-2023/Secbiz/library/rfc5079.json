However, users receiving such calls have the right\r\nto reject them because they are anonymous.  SIP has no way to\r\nindicate to the caller that the reason for call rejection was that\r\nthe call was anonymous.  Such an indication is useful to allow the\r\ncall to be retried without anonymity.  This specification defines a\r\nnew SIP response code for this purpose.
