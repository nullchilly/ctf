It is important to globally\r\noptimize network resource utilization, taking into account all\r\nlayers rather than optimizing resource utilization at each layer\r\nindependently.  This allows better network efficiency to be achieved\r\nthrough a process that we call inter-layer traffic engineering.  The\r\nPath Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve\r\ninter-layer traffic engineering.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a framework for applying the PCE-based\r\narchitecture to inter-layer Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and\r\nGeneralized MPLS (GMPLS) traffic engineering.  It provides\r\nsuggestions for the deployment of PCE in support of multi-layer\r\nnetworks.  This document also describes network models where PCE\r\nperforms inter-layer traffic engineering, and the relationship\r\nbetween PCE and a functional component called the Virtual Network\r\nTopology Manager (VNTM).  This memo provides information for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"September 2009","keywords":["MPLS","GMPLS","Traffic Engineering","Label Switched Path","Virtual Network Topology"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5623","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5623"}
