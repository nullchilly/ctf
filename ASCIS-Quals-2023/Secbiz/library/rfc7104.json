This\r\nis especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss\r\npatterns can vary greatly between receivers.  One technique that can\r\nbe used to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay\r\nfor all the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in\r\nseparate redundant streams.  This document defines the semantics for\r\ngrouping redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).\r\nThe semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP\r\nGrouping Framework.  Grouping semantics at the Synchronization Source\r\n(SSRC) level are also defined in this document for RTP streams using\r\nSSRC multiplexing.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":["SDP","ssrc","synchronization source","grouping framework"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7104","errata_url":null}
