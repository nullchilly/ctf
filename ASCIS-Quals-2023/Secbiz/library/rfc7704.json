During the early years of the IETF and its\r\nantecedent, participation was almost entirely composed of a small\r\ngroup of well-funded, American, white, male technicians,\r\ndemonstrating a distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in\r\nmanagement and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF,\r\ninteraction style can often contain singularly aggressive behavior,\r\noften including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups with\r\ngreater diversity make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful\r\ndiversity requires more than generic good will and statements of\r\nprinciple.  Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant\r\ndiversity or participation diversity.  This document discusses IETF\r\nparticipation in terms of the nature of diversity and practical\r\nissues that can increase or decrease it.  The document represents the\r\nauthors' assessments and recommendations, following general\r\ndiscussions of the issues in the IETF.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7704","errata_url":null}
