These digital signatures can be verified by building a\r\nchain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a\r\nparticular node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that\r\nwill allow an end user and third parties to determine the trusted key\r\nstate for the root key of the resolvers that handle that user's DNS\r\nqueries.  Note that this method is only applicable for determining\r\nwhich keys are in the trust store for the root key.","pub_date":"December 2018","keywords":["DNSSEC","KSK","RFC5011","DNS","rollover","root-key-sentinel-is-ta-","root-key-sentinel-not-ta-","root key","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8509","errata_url":null}
