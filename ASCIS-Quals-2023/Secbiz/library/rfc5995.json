In fact,\r\nthe Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) uses POST exactly for that\r\npurpose.  On the other hand, WebDAV-based protocols, such as the\r\nCalendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV), frequently require clients\r\nto pick a unique URL, although the server could easily perform that\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nThis specification defines a discovery mechanism through which\r\nservers can advertise support for POST requests with the\r\naforementioned \"add collection member\" semantics.
