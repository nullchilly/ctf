This is accomplished by signaling adjacent IS-IS\r\nneighbors with a higher reverse metric, i.e., the metric towards the\r\nsignaling IS-IS router.","pub_date":"February 2019","keywords":["IGP","IS-IS","Metric","Reverse-Metric","IIH"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8500","errata_url":null}
