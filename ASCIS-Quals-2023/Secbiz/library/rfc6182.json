Resource\r\nusage within the network would be more efficient were these multiple\r\npaths able to be used concurrently.  This should enhance user\r\nexperience through improved resilience to network failure and higher\r\nthroughput.\r\n\r\nThis document outlines architectural guidelines for the development\r\nof a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these\r\narchitectural components come together in the development of a\r\nMultipath TCP (MPTCP).  This document lists certain high-level design\r\ndecisions that provide foundations for the design of the MPTCP\r\nprotocol, based upon these architectural requirements.
