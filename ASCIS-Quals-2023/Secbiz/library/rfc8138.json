Using this dispatch type, this specification\r\ndefines a method to compress the RPL Option (RFC 6553) information\r\nand Routing Header type 3 (RFC 6554), an efficient IP-in-IP\r\ntechnique, and is extensible for more applications.","pub_date":"April 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9008","RFC9035"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8138","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8138"}
