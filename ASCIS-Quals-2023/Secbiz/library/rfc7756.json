This is accomplished by introducing a new\r\ncomponent called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the\r\ntranslations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay.  The application and\/or\r\nnode is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that\r\nprovides end-to-end address transparency.\r\n\r\nThe reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture\r\ndescribed in RFC 7755.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["Data Centre","Data Center","Dual Stack","Single Stack","IDC","IPv4","IPv4 conservation","IPv4 exhaustion","IPv6-only","IPv6 only","IPv6 transition","IPv6 transition technology","XLAT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7756","errata_url":null}
