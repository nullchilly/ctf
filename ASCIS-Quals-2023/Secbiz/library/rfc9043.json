FFV1 is designed to efficiently compress video data in a\r\nvariety of pixel formats. Compared to uncompressed video, FFV1 offers\r\nstorage compression, frame fixity, and self-description, which makes\r\nFFV1 useful as a preservation or intermediate video format.","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":["video preservation","storage","ffmpeg","lossless compression"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9043","errata_url":null}
