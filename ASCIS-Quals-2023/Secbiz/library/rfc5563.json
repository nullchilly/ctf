The mobile\r\ndevice has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to\r\nthe routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many\r\nIPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This\r\ndocument describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on\r\nhaving the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide\r\nmobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.\r\nThis document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as\r\nspecified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be\r\nadopted in 3GPP2.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["mipv4","pmipv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5563","errata_url":null}
