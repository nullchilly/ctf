This document\r\ndefines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, which are\r\nidentified by their synchronization source (SSRC) identifiers, in\r\nSDP, to associate attributes with these sources, and to express\r\nrelationships among sources.  It also defines several source-level\r\nattributes that can be used to describe properties of media sources.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2009","keywords":["[--------]","real-time transport protocol","rtp","synchronization source","ssrc","fid","flow identification","fec","forward error correction"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5576","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5576"}
