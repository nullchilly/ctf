Elwell"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"11","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Session Initiation Proposal Investigation","abstract":"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has a mechanism for conveying\r\nthe identity of the originator of a request by means of the\r\nP-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields.  These\r\nheader fields are specified for use in requests using a number of SIP\r\nmethods, in particular the INVITE method.  However, RFC 3325 does not\r\nspecify the insertion of the P-Asserted-Identity header field by a\r\ntrusted User Agent Client (UAC), does not specify the use of\r\nP-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred-Identity header fields with\r\ncertain SIP methods such as UPDATE, REGISTER, MESSAGE, and PUBLISH,\r\nand does not specify how to handle an unexpected number of URIs or\r\nunexpected URI schemes in these header fields.  This document extends\r\nRFC 3325 to cover these situations.  This document is not an Internet\r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"April 2010","keywords":["SIP","P-Asserted-Identity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3325"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5876","errata_url":null}
