This is information typically\r\ndistributed by IGP routing protocols within the network.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE\r\ninformation can be collected from networks and shared with external\r\ncomponents using the BGP routing protocol.  This is achieved using a\r\nnew BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding\r\nformat.  The mechanism is applicable to physical and virtual IGP\r\nlinks.  The mechanism described is subject to policy control.\r\n\r\nApplications of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic\r\nOptimization (ALTO) servers and Path Computation Elements (PCEs).","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["BGP","North-Bound","API","Link-State","Topology","Controller","Multi-Area","Multi-AS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9029"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7752","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7752"}
