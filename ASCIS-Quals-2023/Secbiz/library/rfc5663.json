This ability to bypass the server for data access can\r\nincrease both performance and parallelism, but requires additional\r\nclient functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on\r\nthe class of storage used.  The main pNFS operations document\r\nspecifies storage-class-independent extensions to NFS; this document\r\nspecifies the additional extensions (primarily data structures) for\r\nuse of pNFS with block- and volume-based storage.
