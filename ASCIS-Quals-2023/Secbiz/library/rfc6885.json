Internationalizing Domain\r\nNames in Applications (here called IDNA2003) defined and used\r\nStringprep and Nameprep.  Other protocols subsequently defined\r\nStringprep profiles.  A new approach different from Stringprep and\r\nNameprep is used for a revision of IDNA2003 (called IDNA2008).  Other\r\nStringprep profiles need to be similarly updated, or a replacement of\r\nStringprep needs to be designed.  This document outlines the issues\r\nto be faced by those designing a Stringprep replacement.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6885","errata_url":null}
