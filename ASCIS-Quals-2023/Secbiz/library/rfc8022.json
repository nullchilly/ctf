Together they form the core routing data model that\r\nserves as a framework for configuring and managing a routing\r\nsubsystem.  It is expected that these modules will be augmented by\r\nadditional YANG modules defining data models for control-plane\r\nprotocols, route filters, and other functions.  The core routing data\r\nmodel provides common building blocks for such extensions -- routes,\r\nRouting Information Bases (RIBs), and control-plane protocols.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":["configuration","IPv6 router advertisements","NETCONF","RESTCONF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8349"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8022","errata_url":null}
