GCM provides both\r\nconfidentiality and data origin authentication, can be efficiently\r\nimplemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and\r\nabove, and is also well-suited to software implementations.  This\r\nmemo defines TLS cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSA, and\r\nDiffie-Hellman-based key exchange mechanisms.
