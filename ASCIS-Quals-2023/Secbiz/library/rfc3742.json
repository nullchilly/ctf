{"draft":"draft-ietf-tsvwg-slowstart-00","doc_id":"RFC3742","title":" Limited Slow-Start for TCP with Large Congestion Windows ","authors":["S. Floyd"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"7","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"Transport and Services Working Group","abstract":" This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  For TCP connections that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a single round-trip time.  Such an increase can easily result in thousands of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested link.  This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased for one window of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCP connections with large congestion windows.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
