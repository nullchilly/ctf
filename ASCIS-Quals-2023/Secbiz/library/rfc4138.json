This document describes the F-RTO detection algorithm\r\nfor detecting spurious TCP retransmission timeouts.  F-RTO is a TCP\r\nsender-only algorithm that does not require any TCP options to\r\noperate.  After retransmitting the first unacknowledged segment\r\ntriggered by a timeout, the F-RTO algorithm of the TCP sender monitors\r\nthe incoming acknowledgments to determine whether the timeout was\r\nspurious.  It then decides whether to send new segments or retransmit\r\nunacknowledged segments.  The algorithm effectively helps to avoid\r\nadditional unnecessary retransmissions and thereby improves TCP\r\nperformance in the case of a spurious timeout.  The F-RTO algorithm can\r\nalso be applied to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  \r\nThis memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["tcp","transmission control protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC5682"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4138","errata_url":null}
