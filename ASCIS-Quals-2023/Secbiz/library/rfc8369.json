Assuming ISO and the Unicode\r\nConsortium follow the practices of the IETF, the next Unicode code\r\npoint size will be 128 bits.  This document describes how this future\r\n128-bit Unicode can be leveraged to improve IPv6 adoption and finally\r\nbring internationalization support to IPv6.","pub_date":"1 April 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8369","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8369"}
