The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed\r\nfor many years, and the last few years have seen an increasingly\r\nrapid deployment of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  As\r\ntime-sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements are\r\nbecoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization\r\nprotocols to provide high accuracy.  This memo describes a multipath\r\napproach to PTP and NTP over IP networks, allowing the protocols to\r\nrun concurrently over multiple communication paths between the master\r\nand slave clocks, without modifying these protocols.  The multipath\r\napproach can significantly contribute to clock accuracy, security,\r\nand fault tolerance.  The multipath approach that is presented in\r\nthis document enables backward compatibility with nodes that do not\r\nsupport the multipath functionality.","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":["NTP","PTP","IEEE 1588","multiple paths"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8039","errata_url":null}
