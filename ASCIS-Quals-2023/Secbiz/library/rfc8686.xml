    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t pn="section-abstract-1">The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
        provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several
        hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired
        resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an
        ALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one or more
        ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-2">In some deployment scenarios, in particular if the information
	about the network topology is partitioned and distributed over several
	ALTO servers, it may be necessary to discover an ALTO server outside
	of the ALTO client's own network domain, in order to get appropriate
	guidance.  This document details applicable scenarios, itemizes
	requirements, and specifies a procedure for ALTO cross-domain server
	discovery.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-3">Technically, the procedure specified in this document takes one
        IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter
        (typically, "ALTO:https") as parameters. It performs DNS lookups (for
        NAPTR resource records in the "in-addr.arpa." or "ip6.arpa." trees)
        and returns one or more URIs of information resources related 
        to that IP address or prefix.</t>

            The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to

            resource <xref target="RFC5693" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5693"/>. ALTO is realized by an
            HTTP-based client-server protocol <xref target="RFC7285" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7285"/>,
            which can be used in various scenarios
            <xref target="RFC7971" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7971"/>.

      <t pn="section-1-2">
            The ALTO base protocol document <xref target="RFC7285" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7285"/> specifies
            the communication between an ALTO client and one ALTO server.
            In principle, the client may send any ALTO query.
            For example, it might ask for the routing cost between any two IP
            addresses, or it might request network and
            cost maps for the whole network, which might be the worldwide
            Internet. It is assumed that the server can answer any query,
            possibly with some kind of default value if no exact data is
            known.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">
            No special provisions were made for deployment scenarios with
            multiple ALTO servers, with some servers having more accurate
            information about some parts of the network topology while others
            have better information about other parts of the network
            ("partitioned knowledge"). Various ALTO use cases have been
            studied in the context of such scenarios. In some cases, one
            cannot assume that a topologically nearby ALTO server (e.g., a
            server discovered with the procedure specified in
            <xref target="RFC7286" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7286"/>) will always provide useful information
            to the client. One such scenario is detailed in
            <xref target="apx.alto_p2p" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix C"/>.  Several solution
            approaches, such as redirecting a client to a server that has more
            accurate information or forwarding the request to such a server on behalf
            of the client, have been proposed and analyzed (see
            <xref target="sec.multiplesources" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A"/>), but no

            for client-side usage in these scenarios.
            An ALTO client that wants to send an ALTO query related to a

            It will use Domain Name System (DNS) lookups to find one or
            more ALTO servers that can provide a competent answer.
            The above wording "related to" was intentionally kept somewhat
            unspecific, as the exact semantics depends on the ALTO service to

      <t pn="section-2-1">This section gives a non-normative overview of the
        ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure. The detailed
        specification will follow in the next section.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">This procedure was inspired by "Location Information
        Server (LIS) Discovery Using IP Addresses and Reverse DNS"
        <xref target="RFC7216" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7216"/> and reuses parts of the basic
        ALTO Server Discovery Procedure <xref target="RFC7286" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7286"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">The basic idea is to use the Domain Name System (DNS),
        more specifically the "in-addr.arpa." or "ip6.arpa." trees,
        which are mostly used for "reverse mapping" of IP addresses
        to host names by means of PTR resource records.
        There, URI-enabled Naming Authority Pointer (U-NAPTR)
        resource records <xref target="RFC4848" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4848"/>,
        which allow the mapping of domain names to 
        Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), are installed
        as needed. Thereby, it is possible to store a mapping from
        an IP address or prefix to one or more ALTO server URIs in the DNS.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure is called
        with one IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service
        Parameter <xref target="RFC4848" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4848"/> as parameters. </t>
      <t pn="section-2-5">The service parameter is usually set to "ALTO:https".
        However, other parameter values may be used in some scenarios -- e.g.,
        "ALTO:http" to search for a server that supports unencrypted
        transmission for debugging purposes, or other application protocol
        or service tags if applicable.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-6">The procedure performs DNS lookups and returns one or more
        URIs of information resources related to said IP address or
        prefix, usually the URIs of one or more ALTO Information
        Resource Directories (IRDs; see <xref target="RFC7285" sectionFormat="of" section="9" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-9" derivedContent="RFC7285"/>).
        The U-NAPTR records also provide preference values, which should
        be considered if more than one URI is returned.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-2-7">The discovery procedure sequentially tries two different lookup
        strategies. First, an ALTO-specific U-NAPTR record is searched in the "reverse
        tree" -- i.e., in subdomains of "in-addr.arpa." or "ip6.arpa." corresponding
        to the given IP address or prefix.
        If this lookup does not yield a usable result, the procedure
        tries further lookups with truncated domain names, which correspond
        to shorter prefix lengths.  The goal is to allow deployment
        scenarios that require fine-grained discovery on a per-IP basis, as
        well as large-scale scenarios where discovery is to be enabled for a
        large number of IP addresses with a small number of additional DNS
        resource records.</t>

            and SP is a U-NAPTR Service Parameter.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-2">The parameter X may be an IPv4 or an IPv6 address
            or prefix in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation (see

            for the IPv4 CIDR notation and <xref target="RFC4291" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4291"/> for IPv6).
            Consequently, the address type AT is either "IPv4" or "IPv6".
            In both cases, X consists of an IP address A and a
            prefix length L.
            From the definitions of IPv4 and IPv6, it follows that 
            syntactically valid values for L are
            0 &lt;= L &lt;= 32 when AT=IPv4 and
            0 &lt;= L &lt;= 128 when AT=IPv6.
            However, not all syntactically valid values of L are actually
            supported by this procedure; Step 1 (see below) will
            check for unsupported values and report an error if
            necessary.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-3">For example, for X=198.51.100.0/24, we get AT=IPv4,
            A=198.51.100.0, and L=24.  Similarly, for X=2001:0DB8::20/128,
            we get AT=IPv6, A=2001:0DB8::20, and L=128.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-4">In the intended usage scenario, the procedure is normally
            always called with the parameter SP set to "ALTO:https".

            future extensions, the procedure <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support being called
            with any valid U-NAPTR Service Parameter

        <t pn="section-3.1-5">The procedure performs DNS lookups and returns one or more
            URIs of information resources related to that IP address or

            For each URI, the procedure also returns order and preference values
            (see <xref target="RFC3403" sectionFormat="of" section="4.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3403#section-4.1" derivedContent="RFC3403"/>),

            values: If AT=IPv4 (i.e., if A is an IPv4 address) and L &lt; 8,
            the procedure aborts and indicates an "unsupported prefix length"
            error to the caller. Similarly, if AT=IPv6
            and L &lt; 32, the procedure aborts and indicates an
            "unsupported prefix length" error to the caller. Otherwise,

            a usable result.  Each of these DNS
            lookups might fail to produce a usable result, due to either a
            normal condition (e.g., a domain name exists, but no ALTO-specific
            NAPTR resource records are associated with it), a permanent error
            (e.g., nonexistent domain name), or a temporary error

            information for the optimization of applications (peer-to-peer
	    applications, overlay networks, etc.), but 
            applications should not rely on the availability of such 
            information for their basic functionality (see

            Consequently, the speedy detection of an ALTO server, even
            though it may give less accurate answers than other servers, or
            the quick realization that there is no suitable ALTO server, is
            in general preferable to causing long delays by retrying
            failed queries. 

      Nevertheless, if DNS queries have failed due to temporary errors, the
      ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure SHOULD inform its caller
      that DNS queries have failed for that reason and that retrying the
      discovery at a later point in time might give more accurate results.

                will be used as a basis for ALTO optimization. This will 
                work fine as long as the network behind the NAT is not too
                big (e.g., if the NAT is in a residential gateway).

                Should the load on the DNS infrastructure caused by these
                lookups become a problem, one solution approach is to
                populate the DNS with ALTO-specific NAPTR records.
                If such records can be found for individual IP addresses
                (possibly installed using a wildcarding mechanism in
                the name server) or long prefixes, the

                lookups for shorter prefix lengths, thus reducing the
                total number of DNS queries.
                Another approach for reducing the load on the DNS

                discovery is to be enabled for a large number of IP
                addresses with a small number of additional DNS resource
                records.

                (i.e., an IPv4 prefix with a prefix length longer than /24)
                will typically connect to the Internet using only a single ISP,

            The ALTO protocol's primary mechanism for protecting

            Typically, when the URI's host component is a host
            name, a further DNS lookup is needed to map it to an
            IP address before the communication with the server
            can begin.  This last DNS lookup (for A or AAAA
            resource records) does not necessarily have to be

            specified in <xref target="RFC2818" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2818"/> are able to

It is also part of a series that is completely specified in "Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS" (RFC 3401).

Entities seeking guidance need to discover and possibly select an ALTO server to ask.  This document proposes an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO server that can give guidance to a given ALTO client.  Unlike some other proposed ALTO discovery mechanisms, this solution works well if the client seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers that are operated by an entity which is not the operator of the access network.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.</t>
              <t>STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.  This is an important change from the previous version of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.</t>

              <t>Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live and on-demand media streaming -- prevalent on the Internet use a significant amount of network resources.  Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data.  Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices.</t>
              <t>This document discusses issues related to an information-sharing service that enables applications to perform better-than-random peer selection.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks.  For example, views to Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded to many network application clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs.  In other words, what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.</t>
              <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network.  These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize them.  Additional services are built on top of the maps.</t>
              <t>This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could also provide ALTO services.  Applications that could use the ALTO services are those that have a choice to which end points to connect.  Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</t>

It addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file sharing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and presents corresponding examples. The document also includes recommendations for network administrators and application designers planning to deploy ALTO, such as recommendations on how to generate ALTO map information.</t>

Approaches 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2 require more than just the
specification of an ALTO protocol extension or a new protocol that
runs between ALTO servers. A large-scale,
                maybe Internet-wide, multidomain deployment would also need
                mechanisms by which an ALTO server could discover other ALTO
                servers, learn which information is available where, and
                ideally also who is authorized to publish information
                related to a given part of the network.  Approach 2.4 needs
                the same mechanisms, except that they are used on the

                It is sometimes questioned whether there is a need for a
                solution that allows clients to ask arbitrary queries, even
                if the ALTO information is partitioned and stored on many
                ALTO servers.  The main argument is that clients are
                supposed to optimize the traffic from and to themselves, and
                that the information needed for that is most likely stored
                on a "nearby" ALTO server -- i.e., the one that can be
                discovered using <xref target="RFC7286" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7286"/>.  However, there
                are scenarios where the ALTO client is not co-located with
                an endpoint of the to-be-optimized data transmission.
                Instead, the ALTO client is located at a third party that
                takes part in the application signaling -- e.g., a so-called
                "tracker" in a peer-to-peer application. One such scenario,
                where it is advantageous to place the ALTO client not at an
                endpoint of the user data transmission, is analyzed in <xref target="apx.alto_p2p" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix C"/>.

            large server with a correspondingly high upload bandwidth.

            So-called "peers" assume the role of both a client and a server.

            Peers that want to share the same file participate in a "swarm".

            from one peer to another.
            A swarm may consist of a very large number of peers.
            Consequently, peers usually maintain logical connections to only
            a subset of all peers in the swarm.
            If a new peer wants to join a swarm, it first contacts a
            well-known server, the "tracker", which provides a list of IP
            addresses of peers in the swarm.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.1-3">A swarm is an overlay network on top of the IP network.
            Algorithms that determine the overlay topology and the traffic
            distribution in the overlay may consider information about
            the underlying IP network, such as topological distance,
            link bandwidth, (monetary) costs for sending traffic from
            one host to another, etc.  
            ALTO is a protocol for retrieving such information. 
            The goal of such "topology-aware" decisions is to improve

            can query an ALTO server for guiding information and receive
            the corresponding replies. However, in the considered
            scenario of a tracker-based P2P application, there are two
            fundamentally different possible locations for where to place the

        <t pn="section-c.2-3">In the following, both scenarios are compared in order to

        <t pn="section-c.2-4">In the first scenario (see <xref target="fig.rcq" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>), the
            resource consumer queries the resource directory for the
            desired resource (F1).  The resource directory returns a
            list of potential resource providers without considering
            ALTO (F2).  It is then the duty of the resource consumer to
            invoke ALTO (F3/F4), in order to solicit guidance regarding
            this list.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.2-5">In the second scenario (see <xref target="fig.3pq" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 4"/>),
            the resource directory has an embedded ALTO client. After 
            receiving a query for a given resource (F1), the resource directory
            invokes this ALTO client to evaluate all resource providers it 
            knows (F2/F3).  Then it returns a list, possibly shortened,
            containing the "best" resource providers to the resource
            consumer (F4).</t>

            ALTO server might be needed after the tracker query, because
            the candidate resource providers could be evaluated using a

        <t pn="section-c.3-1">The problem with the first approach is that while the
            resource directory might know thousands of peers taking part
            in a swarm, the list returned to the resource consumer is
            usually shortened for efficiency reasons. Therefore, the
            "best" (in the sense of ALTO) potential resource providers
            might not be contained in that list anymore, even before
            ALTO can consider them.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.3-2">For illustration, consider a simple model of a swarm, in
            which all peers fall into one of only two categories: assume
            that there are only "good" (in the sense of ALTO's
            better-than-random peer selection, based on an arbitrary
            desired rating criterion) and "bad" peers. Having more
            different categories makes the math more complex but does
            not change anything about the basic outcome of this analysis.
            Assume that the swarm has a total number of N peers, out of
            which there are M "good" and N-M "bad" peers, which are all known
            to the tracker. A new peer wants to join the swarm and
            therefore asks the tracker for a list of peers.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.3-3">If, according to the first approach, the tracker randomly
            picks n peers from the N known peers, the result can be
            described with the hypergeometric distribution. The
            probability that the tracker reply contains exactly k "good"
            peers (and n-k "bad" peers) is:</t>
        <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt="" pn="section-c.3-4">
            / M \   / N - M \

                  \ n /


        / n \        n!
with    \ k /  = -----------    and   n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .. * 1
                  k! (n-k)!
</artwork>
        <t pn="section-c.3-5">The probability that the reply contains at most k "good"
            peers is: P(X&lt;=k) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + .. + P⁠(X=k).</t>
        <t pn="section-c.3-6">For example, consider a swarm with N=10,000 peers known
            to the tracker, out of which M=100 are "good" peers. If the
            tracker randomly selects n=100 peers, the formula yields for
            the reply: P⁠(X=0)=36%, P(X&lt;=4)=99%. That is, with a
            probability of approximately 36%, this list does not contain a
            single "good" peer, and with 99% probability, there are only
            four or fewer of the "good" peers on the list.  Processing
            this list with the guiding ALTO information will ensure that
            the few favorable peers are ranked to the top of the list;
            however, the benefit is rather limited as the number of
            favorable peers in the list is just too small.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.3-7">Much better traffic optimization could be achieved if the
            tracker would evaluate all known peers using ALTO and
            return a list of 100 peers afterwards.  This list would then
            include a significantly higher fraction of "good"
            peers. (Note that if the tracker returned "good" peers
            only, there might be a risk that the swarm might disconnect
            and split into several disjunct partitions.  However,
            finding the right mix of ALTO-biased and random peer
            selection is out of the scope of this document.) </t>
        <t pn="section-c.3-8">Therefore, from an overall optimization perspective, the
            second scenario with the ALTO client embedded in the
            resource directory is advantageous, because it is ensured
            that the addresses of the "best" resource providers are
            actually delivered to the resource consumer. An
            architectural implication of this insight is that the ALTO
            server discovery procedures must support ALTO queries on
            behalf of remote resource consumers.
            That is, as the tracker issues ALTO queries on
            behalf of the peer that contacted the tracker, the tracker
            must be able to discover an ALTO server that can give
            guidance suitable for that peer.
            This task can be solved using the ALTO Cross-Domain Server 
            Discovery Procedure.

        <t pn="section-c.4-4">A new peer of a peer-to-peer application wants to join a
            specific swarm (overlay network), in order to access a specific
            resource.  This new peer will be called "Resource Consumer X",
            in accordance with the terminology of <xref target="RFC6708" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6708"/>, and is
            located in Network x.  It contacts the tracker ("Resource
            Directory"), which is located in Network t. The mechanism by which
            the new peer discovers the tracker is out of the scope of this
            document. The tracker maintains a list of peers that take part
            in the overlay network, and hence it can determine that
            Resource Providers A, B, and C are candidate peers for
            Resource Consumer X.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.4-5">As shown in the previous section, a tracker-side ALTO 
            optimization (cf. Figures <xref target="fig.tracker_alto_client" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3"/>
            and <xref target="fig.3pq" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="4"/>)
            is more efficient than a client-side optimization.
            Consequently, the tracker wants to use the ALTO Endpoint
            Cost Service (ECS) to learn the routing costs between
            X and A, X and B, and X and C, in order to sort
            A, B, and C by their respective routing costs to X.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.4-6">In theory, there are many options for how the

            the tracker could do the following steps:

        <sourcecode type="pseudocode" markers="false" pn="section-c.4-7">
IRD_URIS_A = XDOMDISC(A,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_A   = query the ECS(X,A,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_A

IRD_URIS_B = XDOMDISC(B,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_B   = query the ECS(X,B,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_B

IRD_URIS_C = XDOMDISC(C,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_C   = query the ECS(X,C,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_C
</sourcecode>
        <t pn="section-c.4-8">

            In this scenario, the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure 
            queries might yield:  IRD_URIS_A = ALTO_SRV_A, 
            IRD_URIS_B = ALTO_SRV_B, and IRD_URIS_C = ALTO_SRV_C.
            That is, each ECS query would be sent to a different
            ALTO server. The problem with this approach is that we are
            not necessarily able to
            compare COST_X_A, COST_X_B, and COST_X_C with each
            other. The specification of the routingcost metric
            mandates that "A lower value indicates a higher preference",
            but "an ISP may internally compute routing cost using any method
            that it chooses" 
            (see <xref target="RFC7285" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1.1.1" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-6.1.1.1" derivedContent="RFC7285"/>).
            Thus, COST_X_A could be 10 (milliseconds round-trip time), while
            COST_X_B could be 200 (kilometers great circle distance
            between the approximate geographic locations of the hosts)
            and COST_X_C could
            be 3 (router hops, corresponding to a decrease of the TTL field
            in the IP header).  Each of these metrics fulfills the
            "lower value is more preferable" requirement on its own, 
            but they obviously cannot be compared with each other. Even if there were
            a reasonable formula to compare, for example, kilometers
            with milliseconds, we could not use it, as the units of measurement
            (or any other information about the computation method 
            for the routingcost) are
            not sent along with the value in the ECS reply.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.4-9">To avoid this problem, the tracker tries to send all
            ECS queries to the same ALTO server. As specified
            in <xref target="sec.ecs" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.4"/> of this document, Case 2, it uses
            the IP address of Resource Consumer x as a parameter of
            the discovery procedure:

</t>
        <sourcecode type="pseudocode" markers="false" pn="section-c.4-10">
IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(X,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_A   = query the ECS(X,A,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
COST_X_B   = query the ECS(X,B,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
COST_X_C   = query the ECS(X,C,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
</sourcecode>
        <t pn="section-c.4-11">
    
            This strategy ensures that COST_X_A, COST_X_B, and COST_X_C
            can be compared with each other.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.4-12"/>
        <t pn="section-c.4-13">As discussed above, the tracker calls the ALTO Cross-Domain
            Server Discovery Procedure with IP address X as a 
            parameter.  For the remainder of this example, we assume 
            that X = 2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42.  Thus, the
            procedure call is  
            IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42,"ALTO:https").

            This lookup yields two NAPTR resource records. We have
            to ignore the second one as its service parameter does
            not match our SP, but the first NAPTR resource record has
            a matching service parameter. Therefore, the procedure
