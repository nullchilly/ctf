It provides\r\na structured interface between protocols and mechanisms.  The\r\nresulting framework allows new protocols to reuse existing mechanisms\r\nand allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms.  The framework\r\nalso provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges\r\nwithin a data security layer.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how a SASL mechanism is structured, describes\r\nhow protocols include support for SASL, and defines the protocol for\r\ncarrying a data security layer over a connection.  In addition, this\r\ndocument defines one SASL mechanism, the EXTERNAL mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2222.
