Lawrence"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"20","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"HISTORIC","source":"Legacy","abstract":"A wide range of applications have proposed various extensions of the\r\nHTTP protocol. Current efforts span an enormous range, including\r\ndistributed authoring, collaboration, printing, and remote procedure\r\ncall mechanisms. These HTTP extensions are not coordinated, since\r\nthere has been no standard framework for defining extensions and\r\nthus, separation of concerns. This document describes a generic\r\nextension mechanism for HTTP, which is designed to address the\r\ntension between private agreement and public specification and to\r\naccommodate extension of applications using HTTP clients, servers,\r\nand proxies.  The proposal associates each extension with a globally\r\nunique identifier, and uses HTTP header fields to carry the extension\r\nidentifier and related information between the parties involved in\r\nthe extended communication.","pub_date":"January 2000","keywords":["hyper-text","transfer","protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC2774","errata_url":null}
