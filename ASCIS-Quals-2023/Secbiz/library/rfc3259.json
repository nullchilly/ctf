The Mbus provides automatic location of communication peers, subject based addressing, reliable message transfer and different types of communication schemes.  The protocol is layered on top of IP multicast and is specified for IPv4 and IPv6.  The IP multicast scope is limited to link-local multicast.  This document specifies the Mbus protocol, i.e., message syntax, addressing and transport mechanisms. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
