The Personal Assertion Token, PASSporT, is\r\ncryptographically signed to protect the integrity of the identity of\r\nthe originator and to verify the assertion of the identity\r\ninformation at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is\r\ndefined with the intention that it can confidently verify the\r\noriginating persona even when the signature is sent to the\r\ndestination party over an insecure channel.  PASSporT is particularly\r\nuseful for many personal-communications applications over IP networks\r\nand other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating\r\nand destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8225","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8225"}
