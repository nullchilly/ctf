      <t pn="section-abstract-1">The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to
      cryptographic algorithms deployed widely today.  The Internet Key Exchange
      Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could
      be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them
      at a later time when a quantum computer is available.  It is anticipated
      that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange
      algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To
      address this problem before then, this document describes an extension
      of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using
      preshared keys.</t>

      <t pn="section-1-1">Recent achievements in developing quantum computers demonstrate that
      it is probably feasible to build one that is cryptographically significant. If
      such a computer is implemented, many of the cryptographic algorithms and
      protocols currently in use would be insecure.  A quantum computer would
      be able to solve Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
      (ECDH) problems in polynomial time <xref target="I-D.hoffman-c2pq" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="C2PQ"/>, and this would imply that the security of existing
      IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7296"/> systems would be
      compromised.  IKEv1 <xref target="RFC2409" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2409"/>, when used with strong preshared
      keys, is not vulnerable to quantum attacks because those keys are one of
      the inputs to the key derivation function.  If the preshared key has
      sufficient entropy and the Pseudorandom Function (PRF), encryption, and authentication
      transforms are quantum secure, then the resulting system is believed to
      be quantum secure -- that is, secure against classical attackers of
      today or future attackers with a quantum computer.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">This document describes a way to extend IKEv2 to have a similar
      property; assuming that the two end systems share a long secret key,
      then the
      resulting exchange is quantum secure.
      By bringing post-quantum security to IKEv2, this document removes the need
      to use an obsolete version of IKE in order to achieve
      that security goal.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">The general idea is that we add an additional secret that is shared
      between the initiator and the responder; this secret is in addition to
      the authentication method that is already provided within IKEv2.  We
      stir this secret into the SK_d value, which is used to generate the key
      material (KEYMAT) for the Child Security Associations (SAs) and the
      SKEYSEED for the IKE SAs created as a result
      of the initial IKE SA rekey. This secret provides quantum resistance to
      the IPsec SAs and any subsequent IKE SAs. We also stir the secret into the SK_pi and SK_pr values;
      this allows both sides to detect a secret mismatch cleanly.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">It was considered important to minimize the changes to IKEv2.
      The existing mechanisms to perform authentication and key exchange remain
      in place (that is, we continue to perform (EC)DH and potentially PKI
      authentication if configured). This document does not replace the authentication
      checks that the protocol does; instead, they are 
      strengthened by using an additional secret key.</t>

      The peers then exchange AUTH payloads after EAP is successfully completed.
      As a result, the responder sends the AUTH payload twice -- in the first

      <name slugifiedName="name-security-considerations">Security Considerations</name>
      <t pn="section-6-1">A critical consideration is how to ensure the randomness of this
  post-quantum preshared key. Quantum computers are able to perform Grover's
  algorithm <xref target="GROVER" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GROVER"/>; that effectively halves the size of
      a symmetric key.   In addition, an adversary impersonating the server,
      even with a conventional computer, can perform a dictionary search over
  plausible post-quantum preshared key values. The strongest practice is
  to ensure that any post-quantum preshared key contains at least 256 bits of
  entropy; this will provide 128 bits of post-quantum security, while
  providing security against conventional dictionary attacks.  That provides the security
      equivalent to Category 5 as defined in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
      Call for Proposals <xref target="NISTPQCFP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NISTPQCFP"/>. Deriving
      a post-quantum preshared key from a password, name, or other low-entropy
      source is not secure because of these known attacks.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-2">With this protocol, the computed SK_d is a function of the
      PPK. Assuming that the PPK has sufficient entropy (for example, at least
      2<sup>256</sup> possible values), even if an attacker was able to recover the
      rest of the inputs to the PRF function, it would be infeasible to use
      Grover's algorithm with a quantum computer to recover the SK_d value.
      Similarly, all keys that are a function of SK_d, which include all Child
      SA keys and all keys for subsequent IKE SAs (created when the initial
      IKE SA is rekeyed), are also quantum secure (assuming that the PPK was
      of high enough entropy and that all the subkeys are sufficiently long).
      </t>
      <t pn="section-6-3">An attacker with a quantum computer that can decrypt the initial IKE
      SA has access to all the information exchanged over it, such as
      identities of the peers, configuration parameters, and all negotiated
      IPsec SA information (including traffic selectors), with the exception
      of the cryptographic keys used by the IPsec SAs, which are protected by
      the PPK.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-6-4">Deployments that treat this information as sensitive or that send other sensitive data (like cryptographic keys) 
      over IKE SAs <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> rekey the IKE SA before the sensitive information is sent to ensure this information is protected by the PPK.
      It is possible to create a childless IKE SA as specified in <xref target="RFC6023" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6023"/>. This prevents Child SA 
      configuration information from being transmitted in the original IKE SA that is not protected by a PPK. 
      Some information related to IKE SA that is sent in the IKE_AUTH exchange, such as peer identities, feature notifications, 
      vendor IDs, etc., cannot be hidden from the attack described above, even if the additional IKE SA rekey is performed. 
      </t>
      <t pn="section-6-5">In addition, the policy <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be set to negotiate only quantum-secure  
      symmetric algorithms; while this RFC doesn't claim to give 
      advice as to what algorithms are secure (as that may change 
      based on future cryptographical results), below is a list of defined IKEv2 and 
      IPsec algorithms that should not be used, as they are known to provide less than 128 bits of post-quantum security: 
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" pn="section-6-6">
        <li pn="section-6-6.1">Any IKEv2 encryption algorithm, PRF, or integrity algorithm with a
	key size less than 256 bits.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.2">Any ESP transform with a key size less than 256 bits.</li>
        <li pn="section-6-6.3">PRF_AES128_XCBC and PRF_AES128_CBC: even though they can use as
	input a key of arbitrary size, such input keys are converted into a 128-bit key for internal use.</li>
      </ul>
      <t pn="section-6-7"><xref target="Exchanges" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3"/> requires the initiator to
      abort the initial exchange if using PPKs is mandatory for it but the
      responder does not include the USE_PPK notification in the response. In
      this situation, when the initiator aborts the negotiation, it leaves a
      half-open IKE SA on the responder (because IKE_SA_INIT completes
      successfully from the responder's point of view). This half-open SA will
      eventually expire and be deleted, but if the initiator continues its
      attempts to create IKE SA with a high enough rate, then the responder may
      consider it a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and take protective
      measures (see <xref target="RFC8019" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8019"/> for more
      details). In this situation, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the
      initiator cache the negative result of the negotiation and not attempt
      to create it again for some time. This period of time may vary, but it
      is believed that waiting for at least few minutes will not cause the
      responder to treat it as a DoS attack. Note that this situation would
      most likely be a result of misconfiguration, and some reconfiguration of
      the peers would probably be needed.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-8">If using PPKs is optional for both peers and they authenticate themselves using digital signatures, then
      an attacker in between, equipped with a quantum computer capable of breaking public key operations 
      in real time, is able to mount a downgrade attack by removing the USE_PPK notification from the IKE_SA_INIT 
      and forging digital signatures in the subsequent exchange. If using PPKs is mandatory for at least one of the peers
      or if a preshared key mode is used for authentication, then the attack will be detected
      and the SA won't be created.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-9">If using PPKs is mandatory for the initiator, then an attacker able
      to eavesdrop and inject packets into the network can prevent creation of an
      IKE SA by mounting the following attack. The attacker intercepts the
      initial request containing the USE_PPK notification and injects a forged
      response containing no USE_PPK.  If the attacker manages to inject this
      packet before the responder sends a genuine response, then the initiator
      would abort the exchange. To thwart this kind of attack, it is
      <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that, if using PPKs is mandatory for the
      initiator and the received response doesn't contain the USE_PPK
      notification, the initiator not abort the exchange
      immediately. Instead, it waits for more response messages,
      retransmitting the request as if no responses were received at all, until
      either the received message contains the USE_PPK notification or the exchange times
      out (see <xref target="RFC7296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="2.4" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.4" derivedContent="RFC7296"/> for more details about retransmission timers in
      IKEv2). If none of the received responses contains USE_PPK, then the
      exchange is aborted.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-10">If using a PPK is optional for both peers, then in case of misconfiguration (e.g., mismatched PPK_ID), the IKE SA
      will be created without protection against quantum computers. It is
      advised that if a PPK was configured but 
      was not used for a particular IKE SA, then implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> audit this event.

            <abstract>
              <t>Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if very large, specialized quantum computers could be built, they could have a devastating effect on asymmetric classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and elliptic curve signatures and key exchange, as well as (but in smaller scale) on symmetric cryptographic algorithms such as block ciphers, MACs, and hash functions.  There has already been a great deal of study on how to create algorithms that will resist large, specialized quantum computers, but so far, the properties of those algorithms make them onerous to adopt before they are needed.  Small quantum computers are being built today, but it is still far from clear when large, specialized quantum computers will be built that can recover private or secret keys in classical algorithms at the key sizes commonly used today.  It is important to be able to predict when large, specialized quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis will be possible so that organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well before they are needed.  This document describes quantum computing, how it might be used to attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how to predict when large, specialized quantum computers will become feasible.</t>

              <t>This document specifies the NULL Authentication method and the ID_NULL Identification Payload ID Type for Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  This allows two IKE peers to establish single-side authenticated or mutual unauthenticated IKE sessions for those use cases where a peer is unwilling or unable to authenticate or identify itself.  This ensures IKEv2 can be used for Opportunistic Security (also known as Opportunistic Encryption) to defend against Pervasive Monitoring attacks without the need to sacrifice anonymity.</t>

              <t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
              <t>To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-discussion-and-rationale">Discussion and Rationale</name>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-1">The primary goal of this document is to augment the IKEv2 protocol to
      provide protection against
      quantum computers without requiring novel cryptographic algorithms. The idea behind this document is that while a quantum computer can easily
      reconstruct the shared secret of an (EC)DH exchange, it cannot as
      easily recover a secret from a symmetric exchange. This document makes the
      SK_d (and thus also the IPsec KEYMAT and any subsequent IKE SA's SKEYSEED) depend
      on both the symmetric PPK and the Diffie-Hellman exchange.
      If we assume that the attacker knows everything except the
      PPK during the key exchange and there are 2<sup>n</sup> plausible PPKs, then
      a quantum computer (using Grover's algorithm) would take O(2<sup>n/2</sup>)
      time to recover the PPK. So, even if the (EC)DH can be trivially
      solved, the attacker still can't recover any key material
      (except for the SK_ei, SK_er, SK_ai, and SK_ar values for the initial IKE exchange) unless they
      can find the PPK, which is too difficult if the PPK has enough
      entropy (for example, 256 bits).
      Note that we do allow an attacker with a quantum computer to
      rederive the keying material for the initial IKE SA; this was
      a compromise to allow the responder to select the correct PPK quickly. </t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-2">Another goal of this protocol is to minimize the number of changes 
      within the IKEv2 protocol, in particular, within the cryptography 
      of IKEv2.  By limiting our changes to notifications and only adjusting the 
	  SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr, it is hoped that this would be implementable, even 
	  on systems that perform most of the IKEv2 processing in hardware.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-3">A third goal is to be friendly to incremental deployment in
      operational networks for which we might not want to have a global
      shared key or for which quantum-secure IKEv2 is rolled out incrementally. This is
      why we specifically try to allow the PPK to be dependent on the peer and
      why we allow the PPK to be configured as optional.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-4">A fourth goal is to avoid violating any of the security properties
      provided by IKEv2.</t>
