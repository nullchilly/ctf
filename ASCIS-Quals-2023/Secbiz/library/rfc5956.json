The semantics defined in this\r\ndocument are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888).\r\nThese semantics allow the description of grouping relationships\r\nbetween the source and repair flows when one or more source and\/or\r\nrepair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide\r\nsupport for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization\r\nSource) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for\r\nReal-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"September 2010","keywords":["[--------]","FEC","loss repair","grouping","sdp","media lines"],"obsoletes":["RFC4756"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5956","errata_url":null}
