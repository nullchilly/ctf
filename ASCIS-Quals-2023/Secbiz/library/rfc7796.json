A VPLS Provider Edge (PE)\r\nmodel is illustrated as an example for the solution.  In the\r\nsolution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by Pseudowires (PWs),\r\nwhich carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute.  The MAC\r\naddress-based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same\r\nway as specified in RFC 4762 and RFC 4448, respectively.  A signaling\r\nmechanism is described to support E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping\r\nnegotiation.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["Etree"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7796","errata_url":null}
