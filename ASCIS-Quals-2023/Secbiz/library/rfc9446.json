There are four perspectives: that of someone who was involved\r\nwith sifting through the information to responsibly inform the\r\npublic, that of a security area director of the IETF, that of a human\r\nrights expert, and that of a computer science and affiliate law\r\nprofessor. The purpose of this memo is to provide some historical\r\nperspective, while at the same time offering a view as to what\r\nsecurity and privacy challenges the technical community should\r\nconsider.  These essays do not represent a consensus view, but that\r\nof the individual authors.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":["pervasive monitoring","privacy","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9446","errata_url":null}
