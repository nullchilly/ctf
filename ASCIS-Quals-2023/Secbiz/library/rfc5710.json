Such LSP rerouting may be desirable\r\nin a number of cases, including, for example, soft-preemption and\r\ngraceful shutdown.  This document describes the usage of existing\r\nStandards Track mechanisms to support LSP rerouting.  In this case, it\r\nrelies on mechanisms already defined as part of RSVP-TE and simply\r\ndescribes a sequence of actions to be executed.  While existing\r\nprotocol definitions can be used to support reroute applications, this\r\ndocument also defines a new reroute-specific error code to allow for\r\nthe future definition of reroute-application-specific error values.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"January 2010","keywords":["[--------]","resource reservation protocol","rsvp","multiprotocol label switching","generalized mpls","rsvp-te"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5710","errata_url":null}
