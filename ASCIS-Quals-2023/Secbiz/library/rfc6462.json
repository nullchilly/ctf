Cooper"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"23","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IAB","abstract":"On December 8-9, 2010, the IAB co-hosted an Internet privacy workshop\r\nwith the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Internet Society\r\n(ISOC), and MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence\r\nLaboratory (CSAIL).  The workshop revealed some of the fundamental\r\nchallenges in designing, deploying, and analyzing privacy-protective\r\nInternet protocols and systems.  Although workshop participants and\r\nthe community as a whole are still far from understanding how best to\r\nsystematically address privacy within Internet standards development,\r\nworkshop participants identified a number of potential next steps.\r\nFor the IETF, these included the creation of a privacy directorate to\r\nreview Internet-Drafts, further work on documenting privacy\r\nconsiderations for protocol developers, and a number of exploratory\r\nefforts concerning fingerprinting and anonymized routing.  Potential\r\naction items for the W3C included investigating the formation of a\r\nprivacy interest group and formulating guidance about fingerprinting,\r\nreferrer headers, data minimization in APIs, usability, and general\r\nconsiderations for non-browser-based protocols.\r\n\r\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\r\nworkshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\r\nthose of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect the\r\nviews of the IAB, W3C, ISOC, or MIT CSAIL.  This document is not an \r\nInternet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"January 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6462","errata_url":null}
