This overview includes a brief recap of the MPLS Transport\r\nProfile (MPLS-TP) OAM requirements and functions and the generic\r\nmechanisms created in the MPLS data plane that allow the OAM packets\r\nto run in-band and share their fate with data packets.  The protocol\r\ndefinitions for each of the MPLS-TP OAM tools are defined in separate\r\ndocuments (RFCs or Working Group documents), which are referenced by this\r\ndocument.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; \r\nit is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6669","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6669"}
