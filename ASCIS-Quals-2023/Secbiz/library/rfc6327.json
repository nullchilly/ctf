TRILL accomplishes\r\nthis by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link\r\nstate routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that\r\nincludes a hop count.  Devices that implement TRILL are called\r\nRouting Bridges (RBridges).\r\n\r\nTRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can\r\nhave multiple end stations and RBridges attached.  This document\r\ndescribes four aspects of the TRILL LAN Hello protocol used on such\r\nlinks, particularly adjacency, designated RBridge selection, and MTU\r\n(Maximum Transmission Unit) and pseudonode procedures, with state\r\nmachines.  There is no change for IS-IS point-to-point Hellos used on\r\nlinks configured as point-to-point in TRILL.
