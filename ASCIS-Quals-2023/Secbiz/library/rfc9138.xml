        This document provides the functionalities and design considerations
        for a Name Resolution Service (NRS) in Information-Centric Networking (ICN).  

The purpose of an NRS in ICN is to translate
        an object name into some other information such as a locator, another
        name, etc. in order to forward the object request. This document is a product
        of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).

          The current Internet is based upon a host-centric networking paradigm, where hosts are
          identified with IP addresses and communication is possible
          between any pair of hosts. Thus, information in the current Internet
          is identified by the name of the host (or server) where the information is stored.
          In contrast to host-centric networking, the primary communication
          objects in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) are the named data
          objects (NDOs), and they are uniquely identified by location-independent
          names. Thus, ICN aims for the efficient dissemination and retrieval of
          NDOs at a global scale and has been identified and acknowledged as a
          promising technology for a future Internet architecture to overcome
          the limitations of the current Internet, such as scalability and

          A Name Resolution Service (NRS) in ICN is defined as the service that
          provides the name resolution function for translating an object name
          into some other information such as a locator, another name, metadata,
          next-hop info, etc. that is used for forwarding the object request.
          In other words, an NRS is a service that can be provided by the ICN
          infrastructure to help a consumer reach a specific piece of information
          (or named data object). The consumer provides an NRS with a persistent
          name, and the NRS returns a name or locator (or potentially multiple
          names and locators) that can reach a current instance of the
          requested object.

         routing as an implicit process.  The former is referred to as an "explicit name

          <li pn="section-2.4-2.1">Overhead due to the maintenance of the content location:
                  The content reachability is dynamic and includes new
                  content being cached or content being expired from a cache,
                  content producer mobility, etc. Maintaining a consistent
                  view of the content location across the network requires
                  some overhead that differs for the name resolution approaches.
                  The name-based routing approach may require flooding
                  parts of the network for update propagation. In the worst
                  case, the name-based routing approach may flood the whole network
                  (but mitigating techniques may be used to scope the flooding).
                  However, the explicit name resolution approach only requires
                  updating propagation in part of the name resolution system
                  (which could be an overlay with a limited number of nodes). </li>
          <li pn="section-2.4-2.2">Resolution capability: The explicit name resolution approach, if designed and deployed with sufficient robustness, can offer at least weak guarantees that resolution will succeed for any content name in the network if it is registered to the name resolution overlay.
                  In the name-based routing approach, content resolution depends on the flooding scope of the content names (i.e., content publishing message and the resulting name-based routing tables).
                  For example, when content is cached, the router may only notify its direct neighbors of this information. Thus, only those neighboring
 routers can build a name-based entry for this cached content.
                  But if the neighboring routers continue to propagate this information, the other nodes are able to direct to this cached copy as well. </li>
          <li pn="section-2.4-2.3">Node failure impact: Nodes involved in the explicit name resolution approach are the name resolution overlay servers (e.g., resolution handlers in DONA),
                  while the nodes involved in the name-based routing approach are routers that route messages based on the name-based routing tables (e.g.,  NDN routers).
                  Node failures in the explicit name resolution approach may cause some content request routing to fail even though the content is available.
                  This problem does not exist in the name-based routing approach because other alternative paths can be discovered to bypass the failed ICN routers, given the assumption that the network is still connected.</li>
          <li pn="section-2.4-2.4">Maintained databases: The storage usage for the explicit name resolution approach is different from that of the name-based routing approach.
                  The explicit name resolution approach typically needs to maintain two databases: name-to-locator mapping in the name resolution overlay and routing tables in the routers on the data forwarding plane.
                  The  name-based routing approach needs to maintain only the name-based routing tables.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4-3">Additionally, some other intermediary step may be included in the name resolution -- namely, the mapping of one name to other names -- in order to facilitate the retrieval of named content by way of a manifest <xref target="Westphal" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Westphal"/> <xref target="RFC8569" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8569"/>.
        The manifest is resolved using one of the two above approaches, and it may include further mapping of names to content and location. 
The steps for name resolution then become the following: first, translate the manifest name into a location of a copy of the manifest, which includes further names of the content components and potentially locations for the content, then retrieve the content by using these names and/or location, potentially resulting in additional name resolutions. </t>

           ICN inherently supports mobility by consumers. Namely, consumer or client
           mobility is handled by re-requesting the content in case the mobility
           event (say, handover) occurred before receiving the corresponding
           content from the network. Since ICN can ensure that content reception

           the mobility management to update Routing Information Base (RIB) and FIB entries in ICN routers
           with the new forwarding path in a very short time. Therefore, various
           ICN architectures in the literature have proposed adopting an NRS to

           In NDN <xref target="Zhang2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Zhang2"/>, for producer mobility support, rendezvous mechanisms have been proposed to build interest rendezvous
           (RV) with data generated by a mobile producer (MP). This can be
           classified into two approaches: chase mobile producer and rendezvous data.
           Regarding MP chasing, rendezvous acts as a mapping service that provides
           the mapping from the name of the data produced by the MP to the name
           of the MP's current point of attachment (PoA). 


Alternatively, the RV
           serves as a home agent as in IP mobility support, so the RV enables
           the consumer's Interest message to tunnel towards the MP at the PoA.
           Regarding rendezvous data, the solution involves moving the data produced
           by the MP to a data depot instead of forwarding Interest messages. 

Thus,
           a consumer's Interest message can be forwarded to stationary place called a "data rendezvous", so it would either return the data or fetch it
           using another mapping solution. Therefore, RV or other mapping functions
           are in the role of an NRS in NDN.

          Caching in-network is considered to be a basic architectural component
          of an ICN architecture. It may be used to provide a level of quality-of-service (QoS)
          experience to users to reduce the overall network traffic, to prevent network
          congestion and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and to increase availability.
          Caching approaches can be categorized into off-path caching and on-path
          caching based on the location of caches in relation to the forwarding
          path from the original server to the consumer. Off-path caching, also
          referred to as "content replication" or "content storing", aims to replicate
          content within a network in order to increase availability, regardless of
          the relationship of the location to the forwarding path. Thus, finding
          off-path cached objects is not trivial in name-based routing of ICN.
          In order to support off-path caches, replicas are usually advertised
          into a name-based routing system or into an NRS.

    ICN routing may comprise three steps: name resolution, content request routing,
    and content delivery. This document investigates the name resolution step,
    which is the first and most important to be achieved for ICN routing to be
    successful. A Name Resolution Service (NRS) in ICN is defined as the service
    that provides such a function of name resolution for translating an object
    name into some other information such as a locator, another name, metadata,
    next-hop info, etc. that is used for forwarding the object request.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-5-2">
    This document classifies and analyzes the NRS approaches according to whether
    the name resolution step is separated from the content request routing as an
    explicit process or not. This document also explains the NRS functions used
    to support heterogeneous name types, producer mobility, scalable routing system,
    off-path caching, nameless object, manifest, and metadata. Finally, this document
    presents design considerations for NRS in ICN, which include resolution response
    time and accuracy, resolution guarantee, resolution fairness, scalability,
    manageability, deployed system, and fault tolerance.

              <t indent="0">This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric Networking (ICN), an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support information distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling or enhancing a number of desirable features, such as security, user mobility, multicast, and in-network caching. Mechanisms for realizing these benefits is the subject of ongoing research in the IRTF and elsewhere.  This document describes current research challenges in ICN, including naming, security, routing, system scalability, mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-network caching, and network management.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
   to the Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in
   different domains, the current trend is to develop a common, "thin
   waist" of protocols to enable a horizontally unified IoT
   architecture.  The objective of such an architecture is to make
   resource objects securely accessible to applications across
   organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few proposals
   have been made to build an application-layer based unified IoT
   platform on top of today's host-centric Internet.  However, there is
   a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric nature of today's
   Internet and the mostly information-centric nature of the IoT domain.
   To address this mismatch, the common set of protocols and network
   services offered by an information-centric networking (ICN)
   architecture can be leveraged to realize an ICN-based IoT (or ICN-
   IoT) architecture that can take advantage of the salient features of
   ICN such as naming, security, mobility, compute and efficient content
   and service delivery support offered by it.

   In this draft, we summarize the general IoT demands, and ICN features
   that support these requirements, and then discuss the challenges to
   realize an ICN-based IoT framework.  Beyond this, the goal of this
   draft is not to offer any specific ICN-IoT architectural proposal.

              <t indent="0">   The objective of this proposal is to enable application identifier
   (AI) and network identifier (NI) split in the CCN protocol that has
   several applications such as towards Interest routing optimization,
   mobility, conversational session support, handling indirections in
   manifests, and routing scalability.  We enable this through the
   notion of forwarding label object (FLO), which is an optional hop-by-
   hop payload in the Interest message with a topological name which
   identifies a network domain, router or a host.  FLO can be inserted
   by the end user applications or by the network.  FLO is processed by
   the network resulting in either terminating it or swapping it with a
   new FLO based on the network service context.  Furthermore, depending
   on the application and trust context, a FLO can be subjected to
   policy based actions by the forwarders such as invoking security
   verification or enabling other FLO management actions.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should be subject to explicitly unfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed to achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above. </t>
