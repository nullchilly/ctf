Accordingly, RFC 4757 has been moved to\r\nHistoric status, as none of the encryption types it specifies should\r\nbe used, and RFC 3961 has been updated to note the deprecation of the\r\ntriple-DES encryption types.  RFC 4120 is likewise updated to remove\r\nthe recommendation to implement triple-DES encryption and checksum\r\ntypes.","pub_date":"October 2018","keywords":["GSS-API","GSS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3961","RFC4120"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0218"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8429","errata_url":null}
