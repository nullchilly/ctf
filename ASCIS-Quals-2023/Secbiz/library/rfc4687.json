As with\r\npoint-to-point MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle, and\r\ndiagnose control and data plane defects is critical.\r\n\r\nFor operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs, the\r\ndetection and specification of how to handle those defects are\r\nimportant because such defects not only may affect the fundamentals\r\nof an MPLS network, but also may impact service level\r\nspecification commitments for customers of their network.\r\n\r\nThis document describes requirements for data plane operations and\r\nmanagement for P2MP MPLS LSPs.  These requirements apply to all forms\r\nof P2MP MPLS LSPs, and include P2MP Traffic Engineered (TE) LSPs and\r\nmulticast LSPs.
