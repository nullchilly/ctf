These\r\nare usually the result of misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering\r\nor lack of coordination between autonomous systems (ASes). Existing\r\napproaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator\r\nconfiguration, with no check that the configuration corresponds to\r\nthat of the External BGP (eBGP) neighbor, or enforcement of the two\r\neBGP speakers agreeing on the peering relationship. This document\r\nenhances the BGP OPEN message to establish an agreement of the\r\npeering relationship on each eBGP session between autonomous systems\r\nin order to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.\r\nPropagated routes are then marked according to the agreed\r\nrelationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.","pub_date":"May 2022","keywords":["BGP","Route leak","BGP Role"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9234","errata_url":null}
