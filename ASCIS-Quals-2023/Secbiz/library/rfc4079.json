Peterson"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"7","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Geographic Location\/Privacy","abstract":"GEOPRIV defines the concept of a 'using protocol' -- a protocol that carries GEOPRIV location objects.  GEOPRIV also defines various\r\nscenarios for the distribution of location objects that require the concepts of subscriptions and asynchronous notifications.  This document examines some existing IETF work on the  concept of presence, shows how presence architectures map onto GEOPRIV architectures, and moreover demonstrates that tools already developed for presence could be reused to simplify the standardization and implementation of GEOPRIV.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2005","keywords":["using protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4079","errata_url":null}
