To assess this capability,\r\nand to achieve test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements\r\nare frequently conducted in practice.  The Two-Way Active Measurement\r\nProtocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss\r\nmeasurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently\r\nno round-trip packet loss metric specified according to the RFC 2330\r\nframework.\r\n\r\nThis memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics\r\n(IPPM).
