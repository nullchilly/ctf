The deadline time enables forwarding and\r\nscheduling decisions for time-critical machine-to-machine (M2M)\r\napplications running on Internet-enabled devices that operate within\r\ntime-synchronized networks. This document also specifies a\r\nrepresentation for the deadline time values in such networks.","pub_date":"June 2021","keywords":["Routing header","Timestamp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9034","errata_url":null}
