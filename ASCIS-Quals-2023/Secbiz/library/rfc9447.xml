	<xref target="RFC8555" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8555">ACME</xref> is a mechanism for automating certificate management on the Internet. It enables administrative entities to prove effective control over
	resources, like domain names, and automates the process of issuing certificates that attest control or ownership of those resources.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">
	In some cases, proving effective control over an identifier requires an attestation from a third party who has authority over the resource, for example, an external policy administrator for a namespace other than the DNS application ACME was originally designed to support. In order to automate the process of issuing certificates for those resources, this specification defines a generic Authority Token Challenge that ACME servers can
	issue in order to require clients to return an Authority Token that authorizes a given issuance. The challenge contains a type indication that tells the client what sort of token it needs to acquire. 
	It is expected that the Authority Token Challenge will be usable for a variety of identifier types. 
	In particular, this document describes an architecture for Authority Tokens, defines a JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7519"/> Authority Token format along with a protocol for token acquisition, and shows how to integrate these tokens into an ACME challenge.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
	As a concrete example, <xref target="RFC9448" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9448"/> provides a mechanism that allows service providers to acquire certificates corresponding to a Service Provider Code (SPC) as defined in <xref target="RFC8226" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8226"/> by consulting an external authority responsible for those codes. Furthermore, Communications Service Providers (CSPs) can delegate authority over numbers to their customers, and those CSPs who support ACME can then help customers to acquire certificates for those numbering resources with ACME.  This can permit number acquisition flows compatible with those shown in <xref target="RFC8396" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8396"/>.

	Proving that a device on the Internet has effective control over a non-Internet resource is not as straightforward as proving control over Internet resources, like a DNS zone or a 
	web page. Provided that the issuer of identifiers in a namespace, or someone acting on the issuer's behalf, can implement a service that grants Authority Tokens to the people to whom it has issued identifiers, a generic token could be used as a response to an ACME challenge. This specification, therefore, defines an Authority Token issued by an authority over a namespace to an ACME client for delivery to an ACME server in response to a challenge. Authority over a hierarchical namespace can also be delegated so that delegates of a root authority can themselves act as Token Authorities for certain types of names.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">
	This architecture assumes a trust relationship between certification authorities (CAs) and Token Authorities, i.e., that CAs are willing to accept the attestation of Token Authorities for particular types of identifiers as sufficient proof to issue a credential. It furthermore assumes that ACME clients have a relationship with Token Authorities, which permits them to authenticate and authorize the issuance of Authority Tokens to the proper entities. This ACME challenge has no applicability to identifiers or authorities where those pre-associations cannot be assumed.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">
	The ACME Authority Token Challenge type, "tkauth-01", is here specified for use with the "TNAuthList" (Telephone Number Authentication List) ACME Identifier Type described in <xref target="RFC9448" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9448"/>; in order to use the "tkauth-01" Validation Method with an ACME Identifier Type other than "TNAuthList", that identifier type would need to be listed in a new registration in the ACME Validation Methods registry maintained by IANA. "tkauth-01" furthermore supports different token subtypes. The token subtype is determined by a new ACME challenge field, tkauth-type. An IANA registry is used to manage the values of tkauth-type (see <xref target="IANA-3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3"/>). Additionally, this challenge type also has a new "token-authority" field to designate a location where a token can be acquired.

	  IANA will maintain a registry of tkauth-types under a policy of Specification Required. In order to register a new tkauth-type, specifications must address the following requirements; in cases where a tkauth-type admits of its own subtypes, subtypes inherit these requirements.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-2">
	  While Authority Token types do not need to be specific to a namespace, every token must carry enough information for a CA to determine the name for which certificate issuance is authorized. Some types of Authority Token types might be reusable for a number of different namespaces; others might be specific to a particular type of name. Therefore, 
	  in defining tkauth-types, future specifications must indicate how a token conveys to the CA the name(s) that the Token Authority is attesting that the ACME client controls.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-3">
	  While nothing precludes use cases where an ACME client is itself a Token Authority, an ACME client will typically need a protocol to request and retrieve an Authority Token. The Token Authority will require certain information from an ACME client in order to ascertain that it is an authorized entity to request a certificate for a particular name. The protocols used to request an Authority Token <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> convey to the Token Authority the identifier type and value that will be used in the ACME challenge, as well as the binding (see <xref target="bind" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.3"/>), and those <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be reflected in the Authority Token. A baseline mechanism for how the Token Authority authenticates and authorizes ACME clients to receive Authority Tokens is given in <xref target="acquire" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>.

	  Because the assignment of resources can change over time, demonstrations of authority must be regularly refreshed. Definitions of a tkauth-type <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> specify how they manage the freshness of authority assignments. Typically, a CA will expect a regular refreshing of the token.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-1">
	An Authority Token is used to answer a challenge from an ACME server, upon a request for the issuance of a certificate. It could be that the Authority Token is requested from the Token Authority after a challenge has been received, or it could be that the Authority Token was acquired prior to the initial ACME client request. A Token Authority could grant an Authority Token that has the exact same scope as the requested certificate to a client; alternatively, an Authority Token could attest to all of the resources that the client is eligible to receive certificates for, which could be a superset of the scope of the requested certificate.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-2">
	For example, imagine a case where a Token Authority for DNS names knows that a client is eligible to receive certificates for "example.com" and "example.net". The client asks an ACME server for a certificate for "example.com", and the server directs the client to acquire an Authority Token from the Token Authority. When the client sends an acquisition request (see <xref target="acquire" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>) to the Token Authority, the Token Authority could issue a token scoped just to "example.com" or a token that attests the client is eligible to receive certificates for both "example.com" or "example.net". The advantage of the latter is that if, at a later time (but one within the expiry of the token), the client wanted to acquire a certificate for "example.net", it would not have to return to the Token Authority, as the Token effectively pre-authorized the issuance of that certificate.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-3">
	Applications of the Authority Token to different identifier types might require different scopes, so registrations of tkauth-types should be clear about if and how a scope greater than that of the requested certificate would be conveyed in a token.

        <name slugifiedName="name-binding-challenges">Binding Challenges</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-1">
	Applications that use the Authority Token need a way to correlate tokens issued by a Token Authority with the proper ACME client to prevent replay or cut-and-paste attacks using a token issued for a different purpose. To mitigate this, Authority Tokens contain a binding signed by a Token Authority; an ACME server can use the binding to determine that a Token presented by a client was in fact granted by the Token Authority based on a request from the client and not from some other entity. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the ACME account fingerprint be used for this purpose.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">
	Creating a binding from an Authority Token to a particular ACME account entails that the Token could be reused up until its expiry for multiple challenges issued by an ACME server. This might be a desirable property
	when using short-lived certificates, for example, in any cases where the ACME server issues challenges more frequently that an Authority Token can or should issue tokens or in cases where the Authority Token scope (see <xref target="scope" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2"/>) is broad, so certificates with a more narrow scope may periodically be issued.

	Note that the fingerprint value in the client's JWT is reflected in the Authority Token returned by the Token Authority; the Token Authority has no requirement to validate that fingerprint. Were a fingerprint to be captured by an attacker that had its own account with the Token Authority, it could replay that fingerprint in its own JWT in order to receive an Authority Token with that fingerprint. However, were the attacker to present that Authority Token to an ACME service, the service would see the fingerprint does not match the attacker's ACME account fingerprint. So unless an attacker can compromise a target ACME account or gain similar privileges, the binding would be secure.

	This document specifies a tkauth-type of "atc", which contains a standard
  JWT <xref target="RFC7519" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7519"/> using a signature string defined by a JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7515"/>.

 A new JWT claim, "atc", is
 defined below and lists the identifier type used in this Authority
Token.  The "atc" tkauth-type is restricted to the JWTs; if a
non-JWT format is desired for the ACME Authority Token
Challenge, a different tkauth-type should be specified and registered in the
"ACME Authority Token Challenge Types"
registry defined in <xref target="IANA-3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3"/>.

        For this ACME Authority Token usage of a JWT, it is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> for the payload of the JWT to contain an "iss", indicating the Token Authority that generated the token if the "x5u" or "x5c" element in the header does not already convey that information; typically, this will be the same location that appeared in the "token-authority" field of the ACME challenge, when present. In order to satisfy the requirement for replay prevention, the JWT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a "jti" element and an "exp" claim; the "exp" claim manages token freshness. In addition to helping to manage replay, the "jti" provides a convenient way to reliably track when the same "atc" Authority Token is being used for multiple challenges over time within its set lifetime.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">
        The JWT payload <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also contain a new JWT claim, "atc", for Authority Token Challenge, which contains three mandatory elements in a JSON map: the ATC identifier type ("tktype"), the identifier value ("tkvalue"), and the binding ("fingerprint"). The use of "tktype" is restricted to the values in the "ACME Identifier Types" registry, as defined by <xref target="RFC8555" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8555"/>. The identifier type and value are those given in the ACME challenge and conveyed to the Token Authority by the ACME client. For the purposes of the "atc" tkauth-type, the binding "fingerprint" is assumed to be a fingerprint of the ACME credential for the account used to request the certificate, but the specification of how the binding is generated is left to the identifier type profile for the Authority Token (see <xref target="bind" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.3"/>). The "tkvalue" indicates the scope of the authority that the token and its semantics are outside the scope of this document, as they will be specified by the "tkvalue" identifier in a separate specification.

Practically speaking, that scope may comprise a list of Service Provider Code elements, telephone number range elements, and/or individual telephone numbers.  So for example:

              <t indent="0">In order to prevent the impersonation of telephone numbers on the Internet, some kind of credential system needs to exist that cryptographically asserts authority over telephone numbers. This document describes the use of certificates in establishing authority over telephone numbers, as a component of a broader architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in protocols like SIP.</t>

              <t indent="0">The functions of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are rapidly migrating to the Internet. This is generating new requirements for many traditional elements of the PSTN, including Telephone Numbers (TNs). TNs no longer serve simply as telephone routing addresses: they are now identifiers that may be used by Internet-based services for a variety of purposes including session establishment, identity verification, and service enablement. This problem statement examines how the existing tools for allocating and managing telephone numbers do not align with the use cases of the Internet environment and proposes a framework for Internet-based services relying on TNs.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds to a private key controlled by the third party. A primary use case is that of a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the holder of a domain name). The presented mechanism allows the holder of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time. Importantly, this mechanism does not require any modification to the deployed TLS clients and servers.</t>
