One operating assumption for the profiles defined in RFC\r\n3095 is that the channel between compressor and decompressor is\r\nrequired to maintain packet ordering.  This document discusses aspects\r\nof using ROHC over channels that can reorder packets.  It provides\r\nguidelines on how to implement existing profiles over such channels,\r\nas well as suggestions for the design of new profiles.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2005","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4224","errata_url":null}
