This protocol would\r\nbe used between SS7 Signaling Points using the MTP Level 3\r\nprotocol.  The SS7 Signaling Points may also use standard SS7 links\r\nusing the SS7 MTP Level 2 to provide transport of MTP Level 3\r\nsignaling messages.  The protocol operates in a manner similar to MTP\r\nLevel 2 so as to provide peer-to-peer communication between SS7\r\nendpoints.
