El Malki, Ed."],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"64","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"Mobility for IPv4","abstract":"Mobile IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform IPv4-layer\r\nhandoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.  In\r\ncertain cases, the latency involved in these handoffs can be above\r\nthe threshold required for the support of delay-sensitive or real-time\r\nservices.  The aim of this document is to present two methods to\r\nachieve low-latency Mobile IPv4 handoffs.  In addition, a combination\r\nof these two methods is described.  The described techniques allow\r\ngreater support for real-time services on a Mobile IPv4 network by\r\nminimizing the period of time when a Mobile Node is unable to send or\r\nreceive IPv4 packets due to the delay in the Mobile IPv4 Registration\r\nprocess.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","mip4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4881","errata_url":null}
