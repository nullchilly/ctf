Policy rules within an operator's\r\nenvironment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide,\r\npolicies to a network management function (within a controller, an\r\norchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function\r\ncan then control the configuration and\/or monitoring of network\r\nelements and services.
