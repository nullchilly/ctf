Increasing the\r\nmetric to the highest value on one side of the link is not sufficient\r\nto divert the traffic flowing in the other direction.\r\n\r\nIt is useful for the routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to\r\nbe able to advertise a link as being in a graceful-shutdown state to\r\nindicate impending maintenance activity on the link.  This\r\ninformation can be used by the network devices to reroute the traffic\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate\r\ngraceful-link-shutdown information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["MPLS","IGP","OSPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8379","errata_url":null}
