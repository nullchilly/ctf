It is designed\r\nto operate efficiently and robustly over various link technologies\r\nwith different characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe ROHC framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was\r\ninitially defined in RFC 3095.  To improve and simplify the ROHC\r\nspecifications, this document explicitly defines the ROHC framework\r\nand the profile for uncompressed separately.  More specifically, the\r\ndefinition of the framework does not modify or update the definition\r\nof the framework specified by RFC 3095.
