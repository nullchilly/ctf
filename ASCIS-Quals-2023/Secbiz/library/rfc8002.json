It is used for carrying these certificates in Host\r\nIdentity Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the\r\ncertificate parameter and the error signaling in case of a failed\r\nverification.  Additionally, this document specifies the\r\nrepresentations of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in X.509 version 3 (v3).\r\n\r\nThe concrete use cases of certificates, including how certificates\r\nare obtained and requested and which actions are taken upon\r\nsuccessful or failed verification, are specific to the scenario in\r\nwhich the certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these\r\nscenario-specific aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 7401 and obsoletes RFC 6253.","pub_date":"October 2016","keywords":["Hip Certificate Extension"],"obsoletes":["RFC6253"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7401"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8002","errata_url":null}
