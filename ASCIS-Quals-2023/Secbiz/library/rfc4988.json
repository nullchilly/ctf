For\r\nreducing the IP address configuration latency, the document proposes\r\nthat the new Care-of Address is always made to be the new access\r\nrouter's IP address.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","mip4","delay","packet loss","movement detection","ip address configuration","loation update latency","care-of address","care of address","coa"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4988","errata_url":null}
