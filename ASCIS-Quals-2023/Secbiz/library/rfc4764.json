EAP-PSK provides a\r\nprotected communication channel when mutual authentication is\r\nsuccessful for both parties to communicate over.  This document\r\ndescribes the use of this channel only for protected exchange of\r\nresult indications, but future EAP-PSK extensions may use the channel\r\nfor other purposes.  EAP-PSK is designed for authentication over\r\ninsecure networks such as IEEE 802.11.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"January 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","pre-shared key"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4764","errata_url":null}
