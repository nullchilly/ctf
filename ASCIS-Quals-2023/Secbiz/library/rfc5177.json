A Mobile Router is responsible for the mobility of one or\r\nmore network segments or subnets moving together.  The Mobile Router\r\nhides its mobility from the nodes on the Mobile Network.  The nodes\r\non the Mobile Network may be fixed in relationship to the Mobile\r\nRouter and may not have any mobility function.\r\n\r\nExtensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to support Mobile Networks.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"April 2008","keywords":["[--------]","NEMOv4","Mobile Networks","Moving Networks","Mobile Router","Local Fixed Node","Prefix Table","Mobile Network Prefix","Nested Mobile Networks","Nested Network Mobility"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6626"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5177","errata_url":null}
