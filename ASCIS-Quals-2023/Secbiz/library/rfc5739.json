The configuration payloads specified in RFC\r\n4306 work well for IPv4 but make it difficult to use certain features\r\nof IPv6.  This document specifies new configuration attributes for\r\nIKEv2 that allows the VPN gateway to assign IPv6 prefixes to clients,\r\nenabling all features of IPv6 to be used with the client-gateway\r\n\"virtual link\".  This document defines an Experimental Protocol \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["[--------]","remote vpn access","vpn gateway","virtual link"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5739","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5739"}
