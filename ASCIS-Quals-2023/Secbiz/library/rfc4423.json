Herein are presented the basics of the current namespaces,\r\ntheir strengths and weaknesses, and how a new namespace will add\r\ncompleteness to them.  The roles of this new namespace in the\r\nprotocols are defined.  The memo describes the thinking of the\r\nauthors as of Fall 2003.  The architecture may have evolved since.\r\nThis document represents one stable point in that evolution of\r\nunderstanding.
