The performance\r\nbenchmarks are measured at the IP layer; protection may be\r\nprovided at the sub-IP layer.  The benchmarks and terminology can be\r\napplied in methodology documents for different sub-IP layer protection\r\nmechanisms such as Automatic Protection Switching (APS), Virtual Router\r\nRedundancy Protocol (VRRP), Stateful High Availability (HA), and\r\nMultiprotocol Label Switching Fast Reroute (MPLS-FRR).
