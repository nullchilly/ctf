{"draft":"draft-ietf-msec-mikey-applicability-09","doc_id":"RFC5197","title":"On the Applicability of Various Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) Modes and Extensions","authors":["S. Fries","D. Ignjatic"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"31","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Multicast Security","abstract":"Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) is a key management protocol that\r\ncan be used for \\%real-time applications.  In particular, it has been\r\ndefined focusing on the support of the Secure \\%Real-time Transport\r\nProtocol (SRTP).  MIKEY itself is standardized within RFC 3830 and\r\ndefines four key distribution methods.  Moreover, it is defined to\r\nallow extensions of the protocol.  As MIKEY becomes more and more\r\naccepted, extensions to the base protocol arise, especially in terms\r\nof additional key distribution methods but also in terms of payload\r\nenhancements.\r\n\r\nThis document provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in\r\ngeneral as well as the existing extensions for MIKEY, which have been\r\ndefined or are in the process of definition.  It is intended as an\r\nadditional source of information for developers or architects to\r\nprovide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as well as\r\nadvantages and disadvantages for the different key distribution\r\nschemes.  The use cases discussed in this document are strongly\r\nrelated to dedicated SIP call scenarios providing challenges for key\r\nmanagement in general, among them media before Session Description\r\nProtocol (SDP) answer, forking, and shared key conferencing.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2008","keywords":["key management","media stream security","end-to-end","SRTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5197","errata_url":null}
