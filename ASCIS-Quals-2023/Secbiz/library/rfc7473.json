When an LDP session comes\r\nup, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for\r\nsuch LDP applications even when the peer session is established for\r\nsome other applications like Multipoint LDP (mLDP) or the Inter-Chassis\r\nCommunication Protocol (ICCP).  This document defines a solution by\r\nwhich an LDP speaker announces to its peer its disinterest in such\r\nnon-negotiated applications, thus disabling the unnecessary\r\nadvertisement of corresponding application state, which would have\r\notherwise been advertised over the established LDP session.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8223"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7473","errata_url":null}
