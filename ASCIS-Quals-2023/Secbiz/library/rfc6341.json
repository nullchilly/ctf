In some of these environments, all calls must be\r\nrecorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.  In others, calls may\r\nbe recorded for quality control or business analytics.\r\n\r\nRecording is typically performed by sending a copy of the session\r\nmedia to the recording devices.  This document specifies requirements\r\nfor extensions to SIP that will manage delivery of RTP media to a\r\nrecording device.  This is being referred to as SIP-based Media\r\nRecording.
