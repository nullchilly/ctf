The framework\r\nsupports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable\r\ntransport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming,\r\nmedia. However, FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block FEC\r\ncodes. This document updates RFC 6363 to support FEC codes based on a\r\nsliding encoding window, in addition to block FEC codes, in a\r\nbackward-compatible way. During multicast\/broadcast real-time content\r\ndelivery, the use of sliding window codes significantly improves\r\nrobustness in harsh environments, with less repair traffic and lower\r\nFEC-related added latency.","pub_date":"January 2020","keywords":["FEC","FECFRAME","packet loss recovery","RLC","Sliding Window FEC Codes"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6363"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8680","errata_url":null}
