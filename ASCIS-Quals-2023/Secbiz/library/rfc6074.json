Once\r\nconfigured, the provisioning information is distributed by a\r\n\"discovery process\".  When the discovery process is complete, a\r\nsignaling protocol is automatically invoked to set up the mesh of\r\npseudowires (PWs) that form the (virtual) backbone of the L2VPN.\r\nThis document specifies a number of L2VPN provisioning models, and\r\nfurther specifies the semantic structure of the endpoint identifiers\r\nrequired by each model.  It discusses the distribution of these\r\nidentifiers by the discovery process, especially when discovery is\r\nbased on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  It then specifies how\r\nthe endpoint identifiers are carried in the two signaling protocols\r\nthat are used to set up PWs, the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP),\r\nand the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).
