Chandra"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"33","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IP Routing for Wireless\/Mobile Hosts","abstract":" This document defines a Mobile IPv4 Registration Revocation mechanism whereby a mobility agent involved in providing Mobile IP services to a mobile node can notify the other mobility agent providing Mobile IP services to the same mobile node of the termination of this registration.  The mechanism is also usable by a home agent to notify a co-located mobile node of the termination of its binding as well. Moreover, the mechanism provides for this notification to be acknowledged.  A signaling mechanism already defined by the Mobile IPv4 protocol is leveraged as a way to inform a mobile node of the revocation of its binding.
