Recent NomComs have been scheduling based on the sample\r\ntimeline, and the chairs of the last three NomComs -- Danny McPherson\r\n(2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006), and Andrew Lange (2006-2007) --\r\nhave all reported that this timeline is very aggressive and suggested\r\nstarting earlier.  This document restructures the sample timeline,\r\nbut makes no normative process changes.
