It also provides\r\nmechanisms for the seamless integration of these two technologies in\r\nthe same MPLS\/IP network on a per-VPN-instance basis.  Implementation\r\nof this document enables service providers to introduce EVPN\/PBB-EVPN\r\nProvider Edges (PEs) in their brownfield deployments of VPLS\/PBB-VPLS\r\nnetworks.  This document specifies the control-plane and forwarding\r\nbehavior needed for the auto-discovery of the following: 1) a VPN\r\ninstance, 2) multicast and unicast operation, and 3) a Media Access\r\nControl (MAC) mobility operation.  This enables seamless integration\r\nbetween EVPN and VPLS PEs as well as between PBB-VPLS and PBB-EVPN\r\nPEs.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["EVPN","VPLS","PBB-EVPN","PBB-VPLS","Ethernet Virtual Private Networks","Virtual Private LAN Services","Provider Backbone Bridging"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8560","errata_url":null}
