These extensions represent a portion of\r\nthe Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management\r\nprotocols in the Internet community.  Using these extensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS accounting clients.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 2620 by deprecating the MIB table containing\r\nIPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for\r\nversion-neutral IP address formats.  The remaining MIB objects from\r\nRFC 2620 are carried forward into this document.  This memo also adds\r\nUNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected objects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2006","keywords":["management information base","security","remote access dialin user service","RADIUS-ACC-CLIENT-MIB"],"obsoletes":["RFC2620"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4670","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4670"}
