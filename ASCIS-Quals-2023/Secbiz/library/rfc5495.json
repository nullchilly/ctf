The Hello message has been extended for use in Generalized\r\nMPLS (GMPLS) networks for state recovery of control channel or nodal\r\nfaults.\r\n\r\nThe GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP also allow a restarting node to\r\nlearn which label it previously allocated for use on a Label\r\nSwitched Path (LSP).\r\n\r\nFurther RSVP protocol extensions have been defined to enable a\r\nrestarting node to recover full control plane state by exchanging\r\nRSVP messages with its upstream and downstream neighbors.\r\n\r\nThis document provides an informational clarification of the\r\ncontrol plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are\r\nmultiple node failures, and describes how full control plane state\r\ncan be recovered in different scenarios where the order in which\r\nthe nodes restart is different.\r\n\r\nThis document does not define any new processes or procedures.  All\r\nprotocol mechanisms are already defined in the referenced documents.\r\nThis memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["Hello message","gmpls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5495","errata_url":null}
