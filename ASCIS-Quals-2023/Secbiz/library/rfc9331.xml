      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network
      service called Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput (L4S). L4S
      uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP layer
      that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach, except as
      specified within. L4S uses 'Scalable' congestion control, which induces
      much more frequent control signals from the network, and it responds to
      them with much more fine-grained adjustments so that very low
      (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low queuing
      delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising link
      utilization. Thus, even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high
      bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during periods of
      high traffic load.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from
      'Classic' (e.g., TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic. Then, network
      bottlenecks can be incrementally modified to distinguish and isolate
      existing traffic that still follows the Classic behaviour, to prevent it
      from degrading the low queuing delay and low loss of L4S traffic. This
      Experimental specification defines the rules that L4S transports
      and network elements need to follow, with the intention that L4S flows
      neither harm each other's performance nor that of Classic traffic. It
      also suggests open questions to be investigated during experimentation.
      Examples of new Active Queue Management (AQM) marking algorithms and
      new transports (whether TCP-like or real time) are specified
      separately.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This Experimental specification defines the protocol to be used
      for a new network service called Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable
      throughput (L4S). L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
      scheme at the IP layer with the same set of codepoint transitions as the
      original (or 'Classic') ECN <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/>. <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/> requires an ECN mark to be equivalent
      to a drop, both when applied in the network and when responded to by a
      transport. Unlike Classic ECN marking, i) the network applies L4S
      marking more immediately and more frequently than drop and ii) the
      transport response to each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that
      for drop. The two changes counterbalance each other so that the
      throughput of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a comparable
      non-L4S flow under the same conditions. Nonetheless, the much more
      frequent ECN control signals and the finer responses to these signals
      result in very low queuing delay without compromising link utilization,
      and this low delay can be maintained during high load. For instance,
      queuing delay under heavy and highly varying load with the example
      DCTCP/DualQ solution described below on a DSL or Ethernet link is  
      sub-millisecond on average and roughly 1 to 2 milliseconds at the 99th
      percentile without losing link utilization <xref target="L4Seval22" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="L4Seval22"/> <xref target="DualPI2Linux" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DualPI2Linux"/>.       
      Note that the queuing
      delay while waiting to acquire a shared medium such as wireless has to
      be added to the above. It is a different issue that needs to be
      addressed, but separately (see Section <xref target="RFC9330" section="6.3" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9330#section-6.3" derivedContent="RFC9330"/> of the L4S
      architecture <xref target="RFC9330" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9330"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">L4S relies on 'Scalable' congestion controls for these delay
      properties and for preserving low delay as flow rate scales, hence the
      name. The congestion control used in Data Center TCP (DCTCP) is an
      example of a Scalable congestion control, but DCTCP is applicable solely
      to controlled environments like data centres <xref target="RFC8257" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8257"/>, because it is too aggressive to coexist with
      existing TCP-Reno-friendly traffic. Dual-Queue Coupled AQM, which is
      defined in a complementary Experimental specification <xref target="RFC9332" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9332"/>, is an AQM framework that
      enables Scalable congestion controls derived from DCTCP to coexist with
      existing traffic, each getting roughly the same flow rate when they
      compete under similar conditions. Note that a Scalable congestion
      control is still not safe to deploy on the Internet unless it satisfies
      the requirements listed in <xref target="l4sid_transport_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">L4S is not only for elastic (TCP-like) traffic -- there are Scalable
      congestion controls for real-time media, such as the L4S variant <xref target="SCReAM-L4S" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SCReAM-L4S"/> of the SCReAM <xref target="RFC8298" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8298"/> RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT). The factor that
      distinguishes L4S from Classic traffic is its behaviour in response to
      congestion. 
      The transport wire protocol, e.g., TCP, QUIC, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
      the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), or RTP/RTCP, is orthogonal (and therefore not suitable for
      distinguishing L4S from Classic packets).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">The L4S identifier defined in this document is the key piece that
      distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g., Reno-friendly) traffic.
      Then, network bottlenecks can be incrementally modified to distinguish
      and isolate existing Classic traffic from L4S traffic, to prevent the
      former from degrading the very low queuing delay and loss of the new
      Scalable transports, without harming Classic performance at these
      bottlenecks. Although both sender and network deployment are required
      before any benefit, initial implementations of the separate parts of the
      system have been motivated by the potential performance benefits.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-1">Latency is becoming the critical performance factor for many
        (perhaps most) Internet applications, e.g., interactive web, web
        services, voice, conversational video, interactive video, interactive
        remote presence, instant messaging, online gaming, remote desktop,
        cloud-based applications &amp; services, and remote control of
        machinery and industrial processes. In many parts of the world,
        further increases in access network bitrate offer diminishing returns
        <xref target="Dukkipati06" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Dukkipati06"/>, whereas latency is still a multi-faceted
        problem. As a result, much has been done to reduce propagation time by
        placing caches or servers closer to users. However, queuing remains a
        major, albeit intermittent, component of latency.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">The Diffserv architecture provides Expedited Forwarding (EF) <xref target="RFC3246" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3246"/> so that low-latency traffic can jump the queue of
        other traffic. If growth in latency-sensitive applications continues,
        periods with solely latency-sensitive traffic will become increasingly
        common on links where traffic aggregation is low. During these
        periods, if all the traffic were marked for the same treatment,
        Diffserv would make no difference. The links with low aggregation also
        tend to become the path bottleneck under load, for instance, the
        access links dedicated to individual sites (homes, small enterprises,
        or mobile devices). So, instead of differentiation, it becomes
        imperative to remove the underlying causes of any unnecessary
        delay.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-3">The Bufferbloat project has shown that excessively large buffering
        ('bufferbloat') has been introducing significantly more delay than the
        underlying propagation time <xref target="Bufferbloat" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Bufferbloat"/>. These delays
        appear only intermittently -- only when a capacity-seeking
        (e.g., TCP) flow is long enough for the queue to fill the buffer,
        causing every packet in other flows sharing the buffer to have to work
        its way through the queue.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-4">AQM was originally developed to solve
        this problem (and others). Unlike Diffserv, which gives low latency to
        some traffic at the expense of others, AQM controls latency for <em>all</em> traffic in a class. In general, AQM methods
        introduce an increasing level of discard from the buffer, the longer
        the queue persists above a shallow threshold. 
        This gives sufficient
        signals to capacity-seeking (a.k.a. greedy) flows to keep the
        buffer empty for its intended purpose: absorbing bursts.
	However, Random Early Detection (RED) and other algorithms from the 1990s
        were sensitive to their configuration and hard to set correctly <xref target="RFC7567" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7567"/>. So
        this form of AQM was not widely deployed.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-5">More recent state-of-the-art AQM methods, such
        as Flow Queue CoDel <xref target="RFC8290" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8290"/>, Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) <xref target="RFC8033" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8033"/>, or Adaptive RED <xref target="ARED01" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ARED01"/>, are
        easier to configure, because they define the queuing threshold in time
        not bytes, so configuration is invariant whatever the link rate.
        However, the sawtoothing window of a Classic congestion control
        creates a dilemma for the operator: either i) configure a shallow AQM
        operating point so the tips of the sawteeth cause minimal queue
        delay, but then the troughs underutilize the link, or ii) configure the
        operating point deeper into the buffer so the troughs utilize the
        link better, but then the tips cause more delay variation. Even with a
        perfectly tuned AQM, the additional queuing delay at the tips of the
        sawteeth will be of the same order as the underlying base round-trip
        time (RTT), thereby roughly doubling the total RTT.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-6">If a sender's own behaviour is introducing queuing delay variation,
        no AQM in the network can 'un-vary' the delay without significantly
        compromising link utilization. Even flow queuing (e.g., <xref target="RFC8290" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8290"/>), which isolates one flow from another, cannot
        isolate a flow from the delay variations it inflicts on itself.
        Therefore, those applications that need to seek out high bandwidth but
        also need low latency will have to migrate to Scalable congestion
        control, which uses much smaller sawtooth variations.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-7">Altering host behaviour is not enough on its own though. Even if
        hosts adopt low-latency Scalable congestion controls, they need to be
        isolated from the large queue variations induced by existing Classic
        congestion controls. L4S AQMs provide that latency isolation in the
        network, and the L4S identifier enables the AQMs to distinguish the two
        types of packets that need to be isolated: L4S and Classic. L4S
        isolation can be achieved with a queue per flow (e.g., <xref target="RFC8290" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8290"/>), but a DualQ <xref target="RFC9332" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9332"/> is sufficient and
        actually gives better tail latency <xref target="DCttH19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DCttH19"/>. Both
        approaches are addressed in this document.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-8">The DualQ solution was developed to make very low latency available
        without requiring per-flow queues at every bottleneck. This was useful
        because per-flow queuing (FQ) has well-known downsides -- not least the
        need to inspect transport-layer headers in the network, which makes it
        incompatible with privacy approaches such as IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels and
        incompatible with link-layer queue management, where transport-layer
        headers can be hidden, e.g., 5G.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-9">Latency is not the only concern addressed by L4S. It was known when
        TCP congestion avoidance was first developed that it would not scale
        to high bandwidth-delay products (see footnote 6 of Jacobson and
        Karels <xref target="TCP-CA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TCP-CA"/>).
        Given that Reno congestion control is already beyond its scaling range at 
        regular broadband bitrates over WAN distances <xref target="RFC3649" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3649"/>, 'less unscalable'
        CUBIC <xref target="RFC8312" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8312"/> and Compound <xref target="I-D.sridharan-tcpm-ctcp" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CTCP"/> variants of TCP have been
        successfully deployed. However, these are now approaching their
        scaling limits. Unfortunately, fully Scalable congestion controls such
        as DCTCP <xref target="RFC8257" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8257"/> outcompete Classic ECN
        congestion controls sharing the same queue, which is why they have
        been confined to private data centres or research testbeds.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-10">It turns out that these Scalable congestion control algorithms that
        solve the latency problem can also solve the scalability problem of
        Classic congestion controls. The finer sawteeth in the congestion
        window (cwnd) have low amplitude, so they cause very little queuing delay
        variation, and the average time to recover from one congestion signal
        to the next (the average duration of each sawtooth) remains invariant,
        which maintains constant tight control as flow rate scales. A
        background paper <xref target="L4Seval22" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="L4Seval22"/> gives the full
        explanation of why the design solves both the latency and the scaling
        problems, both in plain English and in more precise mathematical form.
        The explanation is summarized without the mathematics in Section <xref target="RFC9330" section="4" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9330#section-4" derivedContent="RFC9330"/> of

        ii) if it is not desirable for a network node to identify
        transport-layer flows; or iii) if some ECT packets in a flow have been
        ECT(1) (this advice will need to be verified as part of L4S

          and ECT(0) queued separately from ECT(1) and CE packets).
          In <xref target="l4sid_ECT1_CE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix B"/>, the "Risk of
          reordering Classic CE packets within a flow" discusses the resulting 
          ambiguity if packets originally set to
          ECT(0) are marked CE by an upstream AQM before they arrive at a node
          that classifies CE as L4S. It argues that the risk of reordering is
          vanishingly small, and the consequence of such a low level of
          reordering is minimal.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4.2-2">Alternatively, it could be assumed that it is not in a flow's own
          interest to mix Classic and L4S identifiers. Then, the AQM could use
          the IP-ECN field to switch itself between a Classic and an L4S AQM
          behaviour within one per-flow queue. For instance, for ECN-capable
          packets, the AQM might consist of a simple marking threshold, and an
          L4S ECN identifier might simply select a shallower threshold than a
          Classic ECN identifier would.</t>

        of burstiness they introduce. In both cases (senders and links), this
        is a trade-off, because batch-handling of packets is done for good
        reason, e.g., for processing efficiency or to make efficient use of
        medium acquisition delay. Some take the attitude that there is no
        point reducing burst delay at the sender below that introduced by
        links (or vice versa). However, delay reduction proceeds by cutting
        down 'the longest pole in the tent', which turns the spotlight on the
        next longest, and so on.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-2">This document does not set any quantified requirements for links to

          particular link technology without also reviewing opportunities to
          reduce any form of burst delay introduced by that link technology.
          This would at least limit the bursts that the link would otherwise
          introduce into the onward traffic, which would cause jumpy feedback
          to the sender as well as potential extra queuing delay downstream.
          This document does not presume to even give guidance on an
          appropriate target for such burst delay until there is more industry
          experience of L4S. However, as suggested in <xref target="l4sid_congestion_response" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3"/>, it would not seem necessary to
          limit bursts lower than roughly 10% of the minimum base RTT expected

          for links within the public Internet).</t>

          lead operators to tune down the burstiness of those links in their
          networks that are configurable or, failing that, to have to
          compromise on the delay target of some L4S AQMs. It might also
          require specific redesign work relevant to the most problematic link

          other incoming interfaces. For instance, where an L4S AQM is
          implemented to feed into the upstream WAN interface of a home
          gateway, there would be opportunities to alter the Wi-Fi profiles
          sent out of any Wi-Fi interfaces from the same device, in order to

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-2">AQMs are typically implemented where an IP-layer buffer feeds into

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
   nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate
   incipient congestion to the end-points.  Receivers with an ECN-
   capable transport protocol feed back this information to the sender.
   ECN was originally specified for TCP in such a way that only one
   feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recent
   new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP
   (DCTCP) or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more
   accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is
   received in one RTT.  This document updates the original ECN
   specification to specify a scheme to provide more than one feedback
   signal per RTT in the TCP header.  Given TCP header space is scarce,
   it allocates a reserved header bit previously assigned to the ECN-
   Nonce.  It also overloads the two existing ECN flags in the TCP
   header.  The resulting extra space is exploited to feed back the IP-
   ECN field received during the 3-way handshake as well.  Supplementary
   feedback information can optionally be provided in a new TCP option,
   which is never used on the TCP SYN.  The document also specifies the
   treatment of this updated TCP wire protocol by middleboxes.

              <t indent="0">   The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion
   notification in any lower layer or tunnelling protocol that
   encapsulates IP.  The aim is for explicit congestion signals to
   propagate consistently from lower layer protocols into IP.  Then the
   IP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry
   congestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the
   transport layer (L4).  Following these guidelines should assure
   interworking among IP layer and lower layer congestion notification
   mechanisms, whether specified by the IETF or other standards bodies.
   This document updates the advice to subnetwork designers about ECN in
   RFC 3819.

   rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP
   tunnel.  This specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its
   scope includes tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least
   one shim header that is not sufficient on its own for wide area
   packet forwarding.  It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling
   protocols that use such shim header(s) and updates the specifications
   of those that do not mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE,
   Teredo and AMT).  This specification also updates RFC 6040 with
   configuration requirements needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress
   safe.

              <t indent="0">   This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non-
   Queue-Building Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB).  The purpose of this NQB
   PHB is to provide a separate queue that enables smooth, low-data-
   rate, application-limited traffic flows, which would ordinarily share
   a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking traffic, to avoid the
   latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic.  This PHB
   is implemented without prioritization and can be implemented without
   rate policing, making it suitable for environments where the use of
   these features is restricted.  The NQB PHB has been developed
   primarily for use by access network segments, where queuing delays
   and queuing loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested,
   but its use is not limited to such segments.  In particular,
   applications to cable broadband links, Wi-Fi links, and mobile
   network radio and core segments are discussed.  This document
   recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to
   identify Non-Queue-Building flows.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">Relentless congestion control is a simple modification that can be
applied to almost any AIMD style congestion control: instead of
applying a multiplicative reduction to cwnd after a loss, cwnd is
reduced by the number of lost segments.  It can be modeled as a
strict implementation of van Jacobson's Packet Conservation
Principle.  During recovery, new segments are injected into the
network in exact accordance with the segments that are reported to
have been delivered to the receiver by the returning ACKs.

This algorithm offers a valuable new congestion control property: the
TCP portion of the control loop has exactly unity gain, which should
make it easier to implement simple controllers in network devices to
accurately control queue sizes across a huge range of scales.

Relentless Congestion Control conforms to neither the details nor the
philosophy of current congestion control standards.  These standards
are based on the idea that the Internet can attain sufficient
fairness by having relatively simple network devices send uniform
congestion signals to all flows, and mandating that all protocols
have equivalent responses to these congestion signals.

To function appropriately in a shared environment, Relentless
Congestion Control requires that the network allocates capacity
through some technique such as Fair Queuing, Approximate Fair
Dropping, etc.  The salient features of these algorithms are that
they segregate the traffic into distinct flows, and send different
congestion signals to each flow.  This alternative congestion control
paradigm is described in a separate document, also under
consideration by the ICCRG.

The goal of the document is to illustrate some new protocol features
and properties might be possible if we relax the "TCP-friendly"
mandate.  A secondary goal of Relentless TCP is to make a distinction
between the bottlenecks that belong to protocol itself, vs standard
congestion control and the "TCP-friendly" paradigm.

It improves the robustness of congestion control by preventing receivers from exploiting ECN to gain an unfair share of network bandwidth.  The ECN-nonce uses the two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT)codepoints in the ECN field of the IP header, and requires a flag in the TCP header.  It is computationally efficient for both routers and hosts.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The proposals in this document are experimental.  While they may be deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this is the best method for high-speed congestion control.  In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals.  This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments.  For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours).  This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint.  To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community.</t>

              <t indent="0">The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document describes an optional, experimental modification to RFC 3168 to allow TCP SYN/ACK packets to be ECN-Capable. For TCP, RFC 3168 specifies setting an ECN-Capable codepoint on data packets, but not on SYN and SYN/ACK packets. However, because of the high cost to the TCP transfer of having a SYN/ACK packet dropped, with the resulting retransmission timeout, this document describes the use of ECN for the SYN/ACK packet itself, when sent in response to a SYN packet with the two ECN flags set in the TCP header, indicating a willingness to use ECN. Setting the initial TCP SYN/ACK packet as ECN-Capable can be of great benefit to the TCP connection, avoiding the severe penalty of a retransmission timeout for a connection that has not yet started placing a load on the network. The TCP responder (the sender of the SYN/ACK packet) must reply to a report of an ECN-marked SYN/ACK packet by resending a SYN/ACK packet that is not ECN-Capable. If the resent SYN/ACK packet is acknowledged, then the TCP responder reduces its initial congestion window from two, three, or four segments to one segment, thereby reducing the subsequent load from that connection on the network. If instead the SYN/ACK packet is dropped, or for some other reason the TCP responder does not receive an acknowledgement in the specified time, the TCP responder follows TCP standards for a dropped SYN/ACK packet (setting the retransmission timer). This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets.  CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time.  The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.

              <t indent="0">This document specifies the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), which obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC 2385 (TCP MD5).  TCP-AO specifies the use of stronger Message Authentication Codes (MACs), protects against replays even for long-lived TCP connections, and provides more details on the association of security with TCP connections than TCP MD5.  TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.  TCP-AO uses a different option identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to be used simultaneously.  TCP-AO supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with the proposed requirements for the replacement of TCP MD5. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should be constructed on entry to and exit from any IP-in-IP tunnel.  On encapsulation, it updates RFC 3168 to bring all IP-in-IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with RFC 4301 IPsec ECN processing.  On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.  A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included.  In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC 4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.

              <t indent="0">The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall rate of PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN- domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes pass information about these PCN-marks to Decision Points that then decide whether to admit or block new flow requests or to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre-congestion.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP header by reusing the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within a PCN-domain. The PCN wire protocol for non-IP protocol headers will need to be defined elsewhere. Nonetheless, this document clarifies the PCN encoding for MPLS in an informational appendix. The encoding for IP provides for up to three different PCN marking states using a single Diffserv codepoint (DSCP): not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM), and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding. This document obsoletes RFC 5696. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets, instead of dropping them, to indicate congestion to the endpoints.  An ECN-capable receiver will feed this information back to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that it can only feed back one congestion signal per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for other transport protocols, such as RTP/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.  Recent new TCP mechanisms (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data Center TCP (DCTCP)) need more accurate ECN feedback in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document specifies requirements for an update to the TCP protocol to provide more accurate ECN feedback.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion recently encountered by packets in the same flow.  Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This mechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion document, "Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases" (RFC 6789), provides the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience. The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers. To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</t>

DCTCP extends the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the fraction of bytes that encounter congestion rather than simply detecting that some congestion has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the TCP congestion window based on this estimate.  This method achieves high-burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow- buffered switches.  This memo also discusses deployment issues related to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP, discusses the lack of a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver, and presents some possible mitigations.  This memo documents DCTCP as currently implemented by several major operating systems.  DCTCP, as described in this specification, is applicable to deployments in controlled environments like data centers, but it must not be deployed over the public Internet without additional measures.</t>

              <t indent="0">Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend enqueued at a bottleneck.  This can cause noticeable performance degradation for TCP connections traversing such a bottleneck, especially if there are only a few flows or their bandwidth-delay product (BDP) is large.  The reception of a Congestion Experienced (CE) Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mark indicates that an AQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck, and the bottleneck network queue is therefore likely to be short.  Feedback of this signal allows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the congestion control algorithm's reaction to inferred packet loss.  Therefore, this specification defines an experimental change to the TCP reaction specified in RFC 3168, as permitted by RFC 8311.</t>

The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to the sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion control.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.  RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgments (SACKs) and has two parts.  Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) starts fast recovery quickly using time-based inferences derived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback, and Tail Loss Probe (TLP) leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely used duplicate acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering events.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DupAck threshold approach.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-1">This appendix is informative, not normative. It gives a list of
      modifications to current Scalable congestion controls so that they can
      be deployed over the public Internet and coexist safely with existing
      traffic. The list complements the normative requirements in <xref target="l4sid_transport_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/> that a sender has to comply with before
      it can set the L4S identifier in packets it sends into the Internet. As
      well as rationale for safety improvements (the requirements in <xref target="l4sid_transport_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>), this appendix also includes preferable
      performance improvements (optimizations).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-2">The requirements and recommendations in <xref target="l4sid_transport_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/> have become known as the 'Prague L4S
      Requirements', because they were originally identified at an ad hoc
      meeting during IETF 94 in Prague <xref target="TCPPrague" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TCPPrague"/>. They
      were originally called the 'TCP Prague Requirements', but they are not
      solely applicable to TCP, so the name and wording has been generalized
      for all transport protocols, and the name 'TCP Prague' is now used for a
      specific implementation of the requirements.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-3">At the time of writing, DCTCP <xref target="RFC8257" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8257"/> is the
      most widely used Scalable transport protocol. In its current form, DCTCP
      is specified to be deployable only in controlled environments. Deploying
      it in the public Internet would lead to a number of issues, from both
      the safety and the performance perspective. The modifications and
      additional mechanisms listed in this section will be necessary for its
      deployment over the global Internet. Where an example is needed, DCTCP
      is used as a base, but the requirements in <xref target="l4sid_transport_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/> apply equally to other Scalable
      congestion controls, covering adaptive real-time media, etc., not just
      capacity-seeking behaviours.</t>

          the existence of a congestion episode within a round trip, not
          precisely how many packets were ECN-marked or dropped.
          Therefore, in 2001, when ECN feedback was added to TCP <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/>, it could not inform the sender of more than one
          ECN mark per RTT. 
          Since then, requirements for more accurate ECN
          feedback in TCP have been defined in <xref target="RFC7560" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7560"/>, and
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ACCECN"/> specifies a change to
          the TCP protocol to satisfy these requirements. Most other transport

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.4-1">Description: As well as responding to ECN markings in a scalable
          way, a Scalable congestion control needs to react to packet loss in
          a way that will coexist safely with a Reno congestion
          control <xref target="RFC5681" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5681"/> (see the precise normative
          requirement wording in <xref target="l4sid_Prague_req-loss-response" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3, Paragraph 8, Item 2"/>).</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.4-2">Motivation: Part of the safety conditions for deploying a
          Scalable congestion control on the public Internet is to make sure
          that it behaves properly when it builds a queue at a network
          bottleneck that has not been upgraded to support L4S. Packet loss
          can have many causes, but it usually has to be conservatively
          assumed that it is a sign of congestion. Therefore, on detecting
          packet loss, a Scalable congestion control will need to fall back to
          Classic congestion control behaviour. If it does not comply, it
          could starve Classic traffic.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.4-3">A Scalable congestion control can be used for different types of
          transport, e.g., for real-time media or for reliable transport
          like TCP. Therefore, the particular Classic congestion control
          behaviour to fall back on will need to be dependent on the specific
          congestion control implementation.
	  In the particular case of DCTCP,
          the DCTCP specification <xref target="RFC8257" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8257"/> states that
          "A DCTCP sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> react to loss episodes in 
          the same way as conventional TCP,...".  To ensure any Scalable congestion control is safe to deploy over the public Internet, Item
          <xref target="l4sid_Prague_req-loss-response" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="2"/> of <xref target="l4sid_congestion_response" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3"/> in the present spec 
          does not require precisely the same response as Reno TCP, but it does 
          require a response that will coexist safely with Classic congestion controls 
          like Reno.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.4-4">Even though a bottleneck is L4S capable, it might still become
          overloaded and have to drop packets. In this case, the sender may
          receive a high proportion of packets marked with the CE codepoint and
          also experience loss. Current DCTCP implementations each react
          differently to this situation. One approach is to react only to the drop 
          signal (e.g., by halving the cwnd); another approach is to react to both 
          signals, which reduces cwnd by more than half. A compromise 
          between these two has been proposed where the loss response is adjusted to
          result in a halving when combined with any ECN response earlier in the same 
          round. We believe
          that further experimentation is needed to understand what is the
          best behaviour for the public Internet, which may or may not be one of
          these existing approaches.</t>

          in real time on live traffic. A passive monitoring algorithm to
          detect a Classic ECN AQM at the bottleneck and fall back to Classic
          congestion control is described in an extensive technical
          report <xref target="ecn-fallback" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ecn-fallback"/>, which also provides a
          link to Linux source code and a large online visualization of its
          evaluation results. Very briefly, the algorithm primarily monitors
          RTT variation using the same algorithm that maintains the mean
          deviation of TCP's smoothed RTT, but it smooths over a duration of
          the order of a Classic sawtooth.
          The outcome is also conditioned on
          other metrics such as the presence of CE marking and congestion
          avoidance phase having stabilized. The report also identifies
          further work to improve the approach, for instance, improvements with
          low-capacity links and combining the measurements with a cache of
          what had been learned about a path in previous connections. The

          impossible) to determine whether or not the AQM is in a shared
          queue. Nonetheless, this is much easier using active test traffic
          out-of-band because two flows can be used. Section 4 of the same
          report <xref target="ecn-fallback" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ecn-fallback"/> describes a simple
          technique to detect a Classic ECN AQM and determine whether it is in
          a shared queue, which is summarized here.</t>

          congestion control (C, that sets ECT(0)) and one with a Scalable CC
          (L, that sets ECT(1)). If neither flow induces any ECN marks, it can
          be presumed that the path does not contain a Classic ECN AQM. If either

          bias as much as possible at least over the low-to-typical range of
          RTTs that will interact in the intended deployment scenario (see the
          precise normative requirement wording in <xref target="l4sid_Prague_req-rtt-independence" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3, Paragraph 8, Item 4"/>).</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.6-2">Motivation: The throughput of Classic congestion controls is
          known to be inversely proportional to RTT, so one would expect flows
          over very low RTT paths to nearly starve flows over larger RTTs.
          However, Classic congestion controls have never allowed a very low
          RTT path to exist because they induce a large queue. For instance,
          consider two paths with base RTT 1 ms and 100 ms. If a
          Classic congestion control induces a 100 ms queue, it turns
          these RTTs into 101 ms and 200 ms, leading to a throughput
          ratio of about 2:1. Whereas if a Scalable congestion control induces
          only a 1 ms queue, the ratio is 2:101, leading to a throughput
          ratio of about 50:1.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.6-3">Therefore, with very small queues, long RTT flows will

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.6-4">Over higher than typical RTTs, L4S flows can use the same RTT
          bias as in current Classic congestion controls and still work

          queuing delay (see the precise normative requirement wording in

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.7-2">Motivation: As currently specified, the minimum congestion window
          of ECN-capable TCP (and its derivatives) is expected to be 2 sender
          maximum segment sizes (SMSS), or 1 SMSS after a retransmission
          timeout. Once the congestion window reaches this minimum, if there
          is further ECN marking, TCP is meant to wait for a retransmission
          timeout before sending another segment (see <xref target="RFC3168" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1.2" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3168#section-6.1.2" derivedContent="RFC3168">the ECN spec</xref>). In
          practice, most known window-based congestion control algorithms
          become unresponsive to ECN congestion signals at this point. No
          matter how much ECN marking, the congestion window no longer
          reduces. Instead, the sender's lack of any further congestion
          response forces the queue to grow, overriding any AQM and increasing
          queuing delay (making the window large enough to become responsive
          again). This can result in a stable but deeper queue, or it might
          drive the queue to loss, in which case the retransmission timeout mechanism
          acts as a backstop.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.7-3">Most window-based congestion controls for other transport

          <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1.7-4">L4S mechanisms significantly reduce queuing delay so, over the

          because, for the same link capacity, smaller RTT implies a smaller
          window. For instance, consider a residential setting with an
          upstream broadband Internet access of 8 Mb/s, assuming a max
          segment size of 1500 B. Two upstream flows will each have the
          minimum window of 2 SMSS if the RTT is 6 ms or less, which
          is quite common when accessing a nearby data centre. So any more
          than two such parallel TCP flows will become unresponsive to ECN and

          ECN mark when it is already sitting at a window of 1 SMSS,
          <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/> requires it to defer sending for a retransmission

          only need to do so for non-L4S traffic (which they can do because
          the L4S identifier is visible at the IP layer). Therefore, they can

          starts with the 3 DupACK approach, because the RTT estimate is not
          necessarily stable. As long as the initial window is paced, such
          initial use of 3 DupACK counting would amount to time-based loss

          recommendation of <xref target="l4sid_congestion_response" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3"/>. This
          is because pacing of the initial window would ensure that 3 DupACKs

	  For low latency, these implementations can change
          their congestion control to implement L4S, because the congestion

          But they cannot easily satisfy this loss recovery requirement.
          However, it is believed they do not need to, because such
          implementations are believed to solely exist in controlled

            sender to check that each receiver is correctly feeding back
            congestion notifications.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.c.1-4.2">A network can check that its ECN markings (or packet losses)
            have been passed correctly around the full feedback loop by
            auditing Congestion Exposure (ConEx) <xref target="RFC7713" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7713"/>. This assures that the integrity of congestion
            notifications and feedback messages must have both been preserved.
            ConEx information is also available anywhere along the network
            path, so it can be used to enforce a congestion response. Whether
            the receiver or a downstream network is suppressing congestion
            feedback or the sender is unresponsive to the feedback, or both,
            ConEx is intended to neutralize any advantage that any of these
            three parties would otherwise gain.</li>
          <li pn="section-appendix.c.1-4.3">Congestion feedback fields in transport-layer headers are
            immutable end to end and therefore amenable to end-to-end
            integrity protection. This preserves the integrity of a receiver's
            feedback messages to the sender, but it does not protect against
            misbehaving receivers or misbehaving senders. The TCP
            Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5925"/>,
            QUIC's end-to-end protection <xref target="RFC9001" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9001"/>, or
            end-to-end IPsec integrity protection <xref target="RFC4303" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4303"/> can
            be used to detect any tampering with congestion feedback (whether
            malicious or accidental), respectively, in TCP, QUIC, or any
            transport. TCP-AO covers the main TCP header and TCP options by
            default, but it is often too brittle to use on many end-to-end
            paths, where middleboxes can make verification fail in their
            attempts to improve performance or security, e.g., by
            resegmentation or shifting the sequence space.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c.1-5">At the time of writing, it is becoming common to protect the
        integrity of transport feedback using QUIC. However, it is still not
        common to protect the integrity of the wider congestion feedback loop,
        whether based on loss or Classic ECN. If this position changes during
        the L4S experiment, one or more of the above techniques might need to
        be developed and deployed.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c.2-1">Various researchers have proposed to use ECT(1) as a less severe
        congestion notification than CE, particularly to enable flows to fill
        available capacity more quickly after an idle period, when another
        flow departs or when a flow starts, e.g., the Variable-structure congestion Control Protocol (VCP) <xref target="VCP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VCP"/> and Queue View (QV) <xref target="QV" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="QV"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c.2-2">Before assigning ECT(1) as an identifier for L4S, we must carefully
        consider whether it might be better to hold ECT(1) in reserve for
        future standardization of rapid flow acceleration, which is an
        important and enduring problem <xref target="RFC6077" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6077"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c.2-3">Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is another scheme that assigns
        alternative semantics to the IP-ECN field. It uses ECT(1) to signify a
        less severe level of pre-congestion notification than CE <xref target="RFC6660" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6660"/>. However, the IP-ECN field only takes on the PCN
        semantics if packets carry a Diffserv codepoint defined to indicate
        PCN marking within a controlled environment. PCN is required to be
        applied solely to the outer header of a tunnel across the controlled
        region in order not to interfere with any end-to-end use of the ECN
        field. Therefore, a PCN region on the path would not interfere with
        the L4S service identifier defined in <xref target="l4sid_identification" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>.</t>
