It defines\r\nterminology relevant to inter-domain QoS models.  It proposes a new\r\nconcept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class (MQC).  This concept could\r\npotentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain relationships\r\nare built between providers.  It opens up new perspectives for a QoS-\r\nenabled Internet that retains, as much as possible, the openness of\r\nthe existing best-effort Internet.
