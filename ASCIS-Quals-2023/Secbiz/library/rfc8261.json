This document specifies how SCTP can be used on top of\r\nthe Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  Using the\r\nencapsulation method described in this document, SCTP is unaware of\r\nthe protocols being used below DTLS; hence, explicit IP addresses\r\ncannot be used in the SCTP control chunks.  As a consequence, the\r\nSCTP associations carried over DTLS can only be single-homed.","pub_date":"November 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8899","RFC8996"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8261","errata_url":null}
