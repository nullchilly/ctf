Stream\r\nControl Transmission Protocol (SCTP) (RFC 4960) was developed to take\r\nfull advantage of such a multi-homed host to provide a fast failover\r\nand association survivability in the face of such hardware failures.\r\nThis document describes an extension to SCTP that will allow an SCTP\r\nstack to dynamically add an IP address to an SCTP association,\r\ndynamically delete an IP address from an SCTP association, and to\r\nrequest to set the primary address the peer will use when sending to\r\nan endpoint.
