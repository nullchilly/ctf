The purpose is to assist\r\nthe EAP peer in selecting an appropriate Network Access Identifier\r\n(NAI).  This is useful in situations where the peer does not receive\r\na lower-layer indication of what network it is connecting to, or when\r\nthere is no direct roaming relationship between the access network\r\nand the peer's home network.  In the latter case, authentication is\r\ntypically accomplished via a mediating network such as a roaming\r\nconsortium or broker.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism defined in this document is limited in its scalability.\r\nIt is intended for access networks that have a small to moderate\r\nnumber of direct roaming partners.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2005","keywords":["nai","network access identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4284","errata_url":null}
