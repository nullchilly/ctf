In\r\nparticular, it can be used to determine the location-appropriate\r\nPublic Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.\r\n\r\nThe <mapping> element in the LoST protocol specification encapsulates\r\ninformation about service boundaries and circumscribes the region\r\nwithin which all locations map to the same service Uniform Resource\r\nIdentifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service.\r\n\r\nThis document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings\r\nbetween two nodes.  This mechanism is designed for the exchange of\r\nauthoritative <mapping> elements between two entities.  Exchanging\r\ncached <mapping> elements, i.e., non-authoritative elements, is\r\npossible but not envisioned.  Even though the <mapping> element\r\nformat is reused from the LoST specification, the mechanism in this\r\ndocument can be used without the LoST protocol.  This document defines \r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2012","keywords":["Location"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8996"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6739","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6739"}
