This package allows a watcher to learn about\r\ninformation stored by a SIP registrar, including its registered\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nHowever, the registered contact is frequently unreachable and thus\r\nnot useful for watchers.  The Globally Routable User Agent URI\r\n(GRUU), defined in RFC 5627, is a URI that is capable of reaching a\r\nparticular contact.  However this URI is not included in the document\r\nformat defined in RFC 3680.  This specification defines an extension\r\nto the registration event package to include GRUUs assigned by the\r\nregistrar.
