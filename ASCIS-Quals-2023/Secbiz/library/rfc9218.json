Pardue"],"format":["HTML","TEXT","PDF","XML"],"page_count":"21","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"HTTP","abstract":"This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to\r\ncommunicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes\r\nresponses to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a\r\ndownstream intermediary how its responses should be prioritized when\r\nthey are forwarded.  This document defines the Priority header field\r\nfor communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent\r\nmanner, as well as HTTP\/2 and HTTP\/3 frames for reprioritizing\r\nresponses. These share a common format structure that is designed to\r\nprovide future extensibility.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["Response priority","Stream multiplexing","Reprioritization","Server scheduling"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9218","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9218"}
