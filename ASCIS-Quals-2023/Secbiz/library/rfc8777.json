A new DNS resource\r\nrecord named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for\r\nsource-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a\r\nmulticast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource\r\nrecords to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward\r\nmulticast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other\r\nextensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also\r\ndefined.","pub_date":"April 2020","keywords":["DRIAD","DRYAD","AMT","IGMPv3","MLDv2","SSM","amt gateway","amt relay","multicast","multicast replication","multicast encapsulation","amt relay discovery","amt discovery","AMTRELAY"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7450"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8777","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8777"}
