While bilateral External BGP\r\n(EBGP) sessions between exchange participants were historically the\r\nmost common means of exchanging reachability information over an IXP,\r\nthe overhead associated with this interconnection method causes\r\nserious operational and administrative scaling problems for IXP\r\nparticipants.\r\n\r\nMultilateral interconnection using Internet route servers can\r\ndramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead\r\nassociated with connecting to IXPs; in some cases, route servers are\r\nused by IXP participants as their preferred means of exchanging\r\nrouting information.\r\n\r\nThis document describes operational considerations for multilateral\r\ninterconnections at IXPs.","pub_date":"September 2016","keywords":["GROW"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7948","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7948"}
