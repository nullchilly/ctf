              <li pn="section-1.1-2.2.2.1">The term "simultaneous" is critical, as media segment transmission is not considered "streaming" if one downloads a media file and plays it after the download is completed. Instead, this would be called "download and play".</li>
              <li pn="section-1.1-2.2.2.2">This has two implications. First, the sending rate for media segments must match the client's consumption rate (whether loosely or tightly) to provide uninterrupted playback. That is, the client must not run out of media segments (buffer underrun) and must not accept more media segments than it can buffer before playback (buffer overrun).</li>
              <li pn="section-1.1-2.2.2.3">Second, the client's media segment consumption rate is limited not only by the path's available bandwidth but also by media segment availability. The client cannot fetch media segments that a media server cannot provide (yet).</li>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">As the Internet has grown, an increasingly large share of the traffic delivered to end users has become video.
      The most recent available estimates found that 75% of the total traffic to end users was video in 2019 (as described in <xref target="RFC8404" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8404"/>, such traffic surveys have since become impossible to conduct due to ubiquitous encryption).
At that time, the share of video traffic had been growing for years and was projected to continue growing (Appendix D of <xref target="CVNI" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CVNI"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">A substantial part of this growth is due to the increased use of streaming video. However, video traffic in real-time communications (for example, online videoconferencing) has also grown significantly.
While both streaming video and videoconferencing have real-time delivery and latency requirements, these requirements vary from one application to another.
For additional discussion of latency requirements, see <xref target="latency-cons" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">In many contexts, media traffic can be handled transparently as
generic application-level traffic.  However, as the volume of
media traffic continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly
important to consider the effects of network design decisions
on application-level performance, with considerations for
the impact on media delivery.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-2">Even basic virtual reality (360-degree) videos that allow users to look around freely (referred to as "three degrees of freedom" or 3DoF) require substantially larger bitrates when they are captured and encoded, as such videos require multiple fields of view of the scene. Yet, due to smart delivery methods, such as viewport-based or tile-based streaming, there is no need to send the whole scene to the user. Instead, the user needs only the portion corresponding to its viewpoint at any given time <xref target="Survey360" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Survey360"/>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-3">In more immersive applications, where limited user movement ("three degrees of freedom plus" or 3DoF+) or full user movement ("six degrees of freedom" or 6DoF) is allowed, the required bitrate grows even further. In this case, immersive content is typically referred to as volumetric media. One way to represent the volumetric media is to use point clouds, where streaming a single object may easily require a bitrate of 30 Mbps or higher. Refer to <xref target="MPEGI" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MPEGI"/> and <xref target="PCC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PCC"/> for more details.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-1">Even when the bandwidth requirements for media streams along a path are well understood, additional analysis is required to understand the constraints on bandwidth at various points along the path between media servers and media players. Media streams can encounter bottlenecks at many points along a path, whether the bottleneck happens at a node or at a path segment along the path, and these bottlenecks may involve a lack of processing power, buffering capacity, link speed, or any other exhaustible resource.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-2">Media servers may react to bandwidth constraints using two independent feedback loops:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.2-3">
          <li pn="section-3.2-3.1">Media servers often respond to application-level feedback from the media player that indicates a bottleneck somewhere along the path by sending a different media bitrate. This is described in greater detail in <xref target="sec-abr" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.2-3.2">Media servers also typically rely on transport protocols with capacity-seeking congestion controllers that probe for available path bandwidth and adjust the media sending rate based on transport mechanisms. This is described in greater detail in <xref target="sec-trans" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-4">The result is that these two (potentially competing) "helpful" mechanisms each respond to the same bottleneck with no coordination between themselves, so that each is unaware of actions taken by the other, and this can result in QoE for users that is significantly lower than what could have been achieved.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-5">One might wonder why media servers and transport protocols are each unaware of what the other is doing, and there are multiple reasons for that. One reason is that media servers are often implemented as applications executing in user space, relying on a general-purpose operating system that typically has its transport protocols implemented in the operating system kernel, making decisions that the media server never knows about.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-6">As one example, if a media server overestimates the available bandwidth to the media player,</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.2-7">
          <li pn="section-3.2-7.1">the transport protocol may detect loss due to congestion and reduce its sending window size per round trip,</li>
          <li pn="section-3.2-7.2">the media server adapts to application-level feedback from the media player and reduces its own sending rate, and/or</li>
          <li pn="section-3.2-7.3">the transport protocol sends media at the new, lower rate and confirms that this new, lower rate is "safe" because no transport-level loss is occurring.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-8">However, because the media server continues to send at the new, lower rate,
   the transport protocol's maximum sending rate is now limited by the amount
   of information the media server queues for transmission. Therefore, the
   transport protocol cannot probe for available path bandwidth by sending
   at a higher rate until the media player requests segments that buffer 
   enough data for the transport to perform the probing.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-9">To avoid these types of situations, which can potentially affect all the users whose streaming media segments traverse a bottleneck path segment, there are several possible mitigations that streaming operators can use. However, the first step toward mitigating a problem is knowing that a problem is occurring.</t>

consuming a media feed, so in the worst case, the bitrate demands
can be multiplied by the number of simultaneous users to find the bandwidth
requirements for a delivery path with that
number of users downstream. For example, at a node with 10,000
downstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,
approximately 80 Gbps might be necessary for all of them
to get typical content at 1080p resolution.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">However, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by
end users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth
provisioning requirements for the network by performing some kind
of replication within the network.  This can be achieved via object
caching with the delivery of replicated objects over individual
connections and/or by packet-level replication using multicast.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-3">To the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-1">When demand for content is relatively predictable, and especially when that content is relatively static, caching content close to requesters and preloading caches to respond quickly to initial requests are often useful (for example, HTTP/1.1 caching is described in <xref target="RFC9111" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9111"/>). This is subject to the usual considerations for caching -- for example, how much data must be cached to make a significant difference to the requester and how the benefit of caching and preloading cache balances against the costs of tracking stale content in caches and refreshing that content.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-2">It is worth noting that not all high-demand content is "live" content. One relevant example is when popular streaming content can be staged close to a significant number of requesters, as can happen when a new episode of a popular show is released. This content may be largely stable and is therefore low-cost to maintain in multiple places throughout the Internet. This can reduce demands for high end-to-end bandwidth without having to use mechanisms like multicast.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-3">Caching and preloading can also reduce exposure to peering point congestion, since less traffic crosses the peering point exchanges if the caches are placed in peer networks. This is especially true when the content can be preloaded during off-peak hours and if the transfer can make use of "A Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB) for Differentiated Services" <xref target="RFC8622" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8622"/>, "Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT)" <xref target="RFC6817" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6817"/>, or similar mechanisms.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-4">All of this depends, of course, on the ability of a streaming media operator  to predict usage and provision bandwidth, caching, and other mechanisms to meet the needs of users. In some cases (<xref target="sec-predict" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5"/>), this is relatively routine, but in other cases, it is more difficult (<xref target="sec-unpredict" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.6"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-5">With the emergence of ultra-low-latency streaming, responses have to start streaming to the end user while still being transmitted to the cache and while the cache does not yet know the size of the object.  Some of the popular caching systems were designed around a cache footprint and had deeply ingrained assumptions about knowing the size of objects that are being stored, so the change in design requirements in long-established systems caused some errors in production.  Incidents occurred where a transmission error in the connection from the upstream source to the cache could result in the cache holding a truncated segment and transmitting it to the end user's device. In this case, players rendering the stream often had a playback freeze until the player was reset.  In some cases, the truncated object was even cached that way and served later to other players as well, causing continued stalls at the same spot in the media for all players playing the segment delivered from that cache node.</t>

This is a good assumption for client-server applications, such as streaming media or software downloads, but BitTorrent rewarded peers that uploaded as much as they downloaded, so BitTorrent users had much more symmetric usage profiles, which interacted badly with these asymmetric access network technologies.</li>
            <li pn="section-3.6.1-2.2">Some P2P systems also used distributed hash tables to organize peers into a ring topology, where each peer knew its "next peer" and "previous peer". There was no connection between the application-level ring topology and the lower-level network topology, so a peer's "next peer" might be anywhere on the reachable Internet.

These effects can make it difficult to achieve ultra-low-latency for many users and may require accepting relatively frequent user-visible media artifacts.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-3">Applications requiring low-latency live media delivery are generally feasible at scale with some restrictions.  This typically requires the use of a premium service dedicated to the delivery of live media, and some trade-offs may be necessary relative to what is feasible in a higher-latency service. The trade-offs may include higher costs, delivering a lower quality media, reduced flexibility for adaptive bitrates, or reduced flexibility for available resolutions so that fewer devices can receive an encoding tuned for their display. Low-latency live delivery is also more susceptible to user-visible disruptions due to transient network conditions than higher-latency services.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-4">Implementation of a low-latency live media service can be achieved with the use of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) <xref target="RFC8216" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8216"/> by using its low-latency extension (called LL-HLS) <xref target="HLS-RFC8216BIS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="HLS-RFC8216BIS"/> or with Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) <xref target="MPEG-DASH" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MPEG-DASH"/> by using its low-latency extension (called LL-DASH) <xref target="LL-DASH" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="LL-DASH"/>. These extensions use the Common Media Application Format (CMAF) standard <xref target="MPEG-CMAF" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MPEG-CMAF"/> that allows the media to be packaged into and transmitted in units smaller than segments, which are called "chunks" in CMAF language. This way, the latency can be decoupled from the duration of the media segments. Without a CMAF-like packaging, lower latencies can only be achieved by using very short segment durations. However, using shorter segments means using more frequent intra-coded frames, and that is detrimental to video encoding quality. The CMAF standard allows us to still use longer segments (improving encoding quality) without penalizing latency.</t>

In some cases, on-demand media is produced as a by-product of a live media production, using the same segments as the live event but freezing the manifest that describes the media available from the media server after the live event has finished.  In other cases, on-demand media is constructed out of pre-recorded assets with no streaming necessarily involved during the production of the on-demand content.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-1">A simple model of media playback can be described as a media stream consumer, a buffer, and a transport mechanism that fills the buffer.
The consumption rate is fairly static and is represented by the content bitrate.
The size of the buffer is also commonly a fixed size.
The buffer fill process needs to be at least fast enough to ensure that the buffer is never empty; however, it also can have significant complexity when things like personalization or advertising insertion workflows are introduced.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-2">The challenges in filling the buffer in a timely way fall into two broad categories:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-5.1-3">
          <li pn="section-5.1-3.1">Content variation (also sometimes called a "bitrate ladder") is the set of content renditions that are available at any given selection point.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.1-3.2">Content selection comprises all of the steps a client uses to determine which content rendition to play.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-4">The mechanism used to select the bitrate is part of the content selection, and the content variation is all of the different bitrate renditions.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-5">Adaptive bitrate streaming ("ABR streaming" or simply "ABR") is a
   commonly used technique for dynamically adjusting the media quality of a stream to match bandwidth availability. When this goal is achieved, the media server will tend to send enough
   media that the media player does not "stall", without sending so much media that the media player cannot accept it.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-6">ABR uses an application-level response strategy in which the streaming client attempts to detect the available bandwidth of the network path by first observing the successful application-layer download speed; then, given the available bandwidth, the client chooses a bitrate for each of the video, audio, subtitles, and metadata (among a limited number of available options for each type of media) that fits within that bandwidth, typically adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur in the network or changes in capabilities occur during the playback (such as available memory, CPU, display size, etc.).</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.2-2">The media server may also choose to alter which bitrates are made available to players by adding or removing bitrate options from the ladder delivered to the player in subsequent manifests built and sent to the player. This way, both the player, through its selection of bitrate to request from the manifest, and the server, through its construction of the bitrates offered in the manifest, are able to affect network utilization.</t>

ABR playback is commonly implemented by streaming clients using HLS <xref target="RFC8216" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8216"/> or DASH <xref target="MPEG-DASH" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MPEG-DASH"/> to perform a reliable segmented delivery of media over HTTP.

This is done to get a rough sense of the highest (total) media bitrate that the network between the server and player will likely be able to provide under initial network conditions.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-2">Some commonly used forms of advertising can introduce potential user experience issues for a media stream.
This section provides a very brief overview of a complex and rapidly evolving space.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-3">The same techniques used to allow a media player to switch between renditions of different bitrates at segment boundaries can also be used to enable the dynamic insertion of advertisements (hereafter referred to as "ads"), but this does not mean that the insertion of ads has no effect on the user's quality of experience.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-4">Ads may be inserted with either Client-side Ad Insertion (CSAI) or Server-side Ad Insertion (SSAI). In CSAI, the ABR manifest will generally include links to an external ad server for some segments of the media stream, while in SSAI, the server will remain the same during ads but will include media segments that contain the advertising. In SSAI, the media segments may or may not be sourced from an external ad server like with CSAI.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-5">In general, the more targeted the ad request is, the more requests the ad service needs to be able to handle concurrently.
If connectivity is poor to the ad service, this can cause rebuffering even if the underlying media assets (both content and ads) can be accessed quickly.
The less targeted the ad request is, the more likely that ad requests can be consolidated and that ads can be cached similarly to the media content.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-6">In some cases, especially with SSAI, advertising space in a stream is reserved for a specific advertiser and can be integrated with the video so that the segments share the same encoding properties, such as bitrate, dynamic range, and resolution.
However, in many cases, ad servers integrate with a Supply Side Platform (SSP) that offers advertising space in real-time auctions via an Ad Exchange, with bids for the advertising space coming from Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) that collect money from advertisers for delivering the ads.
Most such Ad Exchanges use application-level protocol specifications published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau <xref target="IAB-ADS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IAB-ADS"/>, an industry trade organization.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-7">This ecosystem balances several competing objectives, and integrating with it naively can produce surprising user experience results.
For example, ad server provisioning and/or the bitrate of the ad segments might be different from that of the main content, and either of these differences can result in playback stalls.
For another example, since the inserted ads are often produced independently, they might have a different base volume level than the main content, which can make for a jarring user experience.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-8">Another major source of competing objectives comes from user privacy considerations vs. the advertiser's incentives to target ads to user segments based on behavioral data.
Multiple studies, for example, <xref target="BEHAVE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BEHAVE"/> and <xref target="BEHAVE2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BEHAVE2"/>, have reported large improvements in ad effectiveness when using behaviorally targeted ads, relative to untargeted ads.
This provides a strong incentive for advertisers to gain access to the data necessary to perform behavioral targeting, leading some to engage in what is indistinguishable from a pervasive monitoring attack <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/> based on user tracking in order to collect the relevant data.
A more complete review of issues in this space is available in <xref target="BALANCING" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BALANCING"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-9">On top of these competing objectives, this market historically has had incidents of misreporting of ad delivery to end users for financial gain <xref target="ADFRAUD" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ADFRAUD"/>.
As a mitigation for concerns driven by those incidents, some SSPs have required the use of specific media players that include features like reporting of ad delivery or providing additional user information that can be used for tracking.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-10">In general, this is a rapidly developing space with many considerations, and media streaming operators engaged in advertising may need to research these and other concerns to find solutions that meet their user experience, user privacy, and financial goals.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-1">This kind of bandwidth-measurement system can experience various 
   troubles that are affected by networking and transport protocol
   issues. 
Because adaptive application-level response strategies are often using rates as observed by the application layer, there are sometimes inscrutable transport-level protocol behaviors that can produce surprising measurement values when the application-level feedback loop is interacting with a transport-level feedback loop.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-2">A few specific examples of surprising phenomena that affect bitrate detection measurements are described in the following subsections.
As these examples will demonstrate, it is common to encounter cases that can deliver application-level measurements that are too low, too high, and (possibly) correct but that vary more quickly than a lab-tested selection algorithm might expect.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-3">These effects and others that cause transport behavior to diverge from lab modeling can sometimes have a significant impact on bitrate selection and on user QoE, especially where players use naive measurement strategies and selection algorithms that do not account for the likelihood of bandwidth measurements that diverge from the true path capacity.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5.1-1">When the bitrate selection is chosen substantially below the available capacity of the network path, the response to a segment request will typically complete in much less absolute time than the duration of the requested segment, leaving significant idle time between segment downloads. This can have a few surprising consequences:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-5.5.1-2">
            <li pn="section-5.5.1-2.1">TCP slow-start, when restarting after idle, requires multiple RTTs to re-establish a throughput at the network's available capacity.  When the active transmission time for segments is substantially shorter than the time between segments, leaving an idle gap between segments that triggers a restart of TCP slow-start, the estimate of the successful download speed coming from the application-visible receive rate on the socket can thus end up much lower than the actual available network capacity.  This, in turn, can prevent a shift to the most appropriate bitrate. <xref target="RFC7661" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7661"/> provides some mitigations for this effect at the TCP transport layer for senders who anticipate a high incidence of this problem.</li>
            <li pn="section-5.5.1-2.2">Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping can be impacted by idle time in some networks. The carrier capacity assigned to a physical or virtual link can vary with activity. Depending on the idle time characteristics, this can result in a lower available bitrate than would be achievable with a steadier transmission in the same network.</li>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5.2-2">For instance, in the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with SACK
support (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss
of a packet can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the
receiving application.  Because of the sliding window in TCP,
many packets may be accepted by the receiver without being available
to the application until the missing packet arrives.  Upon the arrival
of the one missing packet after retransmit, the receiver will
suddenly get access to a lot of data at the same time.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5.2-3">To a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the
application layer and interpreting it as an estimate of the
available network bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in
the goodput measurement, presenting as a stall followed by a sudden leap that can far exceed the actual
capacity of the transport path from the server when the hole in
the received data is filled by a later retransmission.</t>

The CDNs produce millions of log lines per second across hundreds of thousands of clients, and they have no concept of a "session" as a client would have, so CDNs are decoupled from the metrics the clients generate and report. A CDN cannot tell which request belongs to which playback session, the duration of any media object, the bitrate, or whether any of the clients have stalled and are rebuffering or are about to stall and will rebuffer. The consequence of this decoupling is that a CDN cannot prioritize delivery for when the client needs it most, prefetch content, or trigger alerts when the network itself may be underperforming. One approach to couple the CDN to the playback sessions is for the clients to communicate standardized media-relevant information to the CDNs while they are fetching data. <xref target="CTA-5004" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CTA-5004"/> was developed exactly for this purpose.</t>

The Internet has continued to work even when the specific TCP mechanisms used to reach equilibrium changed over time <xref target="RFC7414" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7414"/>.

Standards Track protocol <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>, behaves differently than the transport protocols characterized in Sections <xref target="reliable-behavior" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="6.1"/> and <xref target="unreliable-behavior" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="6.2"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-2">Although QUIC provides an alternative to the TCP and UDP transport protocols, QUIC is itself encapsulated in UDP. As noted elsewhere in <xref target="gen-encrypt" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.1"/>, the QUIC protocol encrypts almost all of its transport parameters and all of its payload, so any intermediaries that network operators may be using to troubleshoot HTTP streaming media performance issues, perform analytics, or even intercept exchanges in current applications will not work for QUIC-based applications without making changes to their networks. <xref target="stream-encrypt-media" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/> describes the implications of media encryption in more detail.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-3">While QUIC is designed as a general-purpose transport protocol and can carry different application-layer protocols, the current standardized mapping is for HTTP/3 <xref target="RFC9114" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9114"/>, which describes how QUIC transport services are used for HTTP. The convention is for HTTP/3 to run over UDP port 443 <xref target="Port443" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Port443"/>, but this is not a strict requirement.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-4">When HTTP/3 is encapsulated in QUIC, which is then encapsulated in UDP, streaming operators (and network operators) might see UDP traffic patterns that are similar to HTTP(S) over TCP. UDP ports may be blocked for any port numbers that are not commonly used, such as UDP 53 for DNS. Even when UDP ports are not blocked and QUIC packets can flow, streaming operators (and network operators) may severely rate-limit this traffic because they do not expect to see legitimate high-bandwidth traffic, such as streaming media over the UDP ports that HTTP/3 is using.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-5">As noted in <xref target="noisy-measurements" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.5.2"/>, because TCP provides a reliable, in-order delivery service for applications, any packet loss for a TCP connection causes head-of-line blocking so that no TCP segments arriving after a packet is lost will be delivered to the receiving application until retransmission of the lost packet has been received, allowing in-order delivery to the application to continue. As described in <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>, QUIC connections can carry multiple streams, and when packet losses do occur, only the streams carried in the lost packet are delayed.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-6">A QUIC extension currently being specified <xref target="RFC9221" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9221"/> adds the capability for "unreliable" delivery, similar to the service provided by UDP, but these datagrams are still subject to the QUIC connection's congestion controller, providing some transport-level congestion avoidance measures, which UDP does not.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-7">As noted in <xref target="reliable-behavior" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.1"/>, there is an increasing interest in congestion control algorithms that respond to delay measurements instead of responding to packet loss. These algorithms may deliver an improved user experience, but in some cases, they have not responded to sustained packet loss, which exhausts available buffers along the end-to-end path that may affect other users sharing that path. The QUIC protocol provides a set of congestion control hooks that can be used for algorithm agility, and <xref target="RFC9002" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9002"/> defines a basic congestion control algorithm that is roughly similar to TCP NewReno <xref target="RFC6582" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6582"/>. However, QUIC senders can and do unilaterally choose to use different algorithms, such as loss-based CUBIC <xref target="RFC8312" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8312"/>, delay-based Copa or BBR, or even something completely different.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-8">The Internet community does have experience with deploying new congestion controllers without causing congestion collapse on the Internet. As noted in <xref target="RFC8312" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8312"/>, both the CUBIC congestion controller and its predecessor BIC have significantly different behavior from Reno-style congestion controllers, such as TCP NewReno <xref target="RFC6582" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6582"/>; both were added to the Linux kernel to allow experimentation and analysis, both were then selected as the default TCP congestion controllers in Linux, and both were deployed globally.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-9">The point mentioned in <xref target="reliable-behavior" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.1"/> about TCP congestion controllers being implemented in operating system kernels is different with QUIC. Although QUIC can be implemented in operating system kernels, one of the design goals when this work was chartered was "QUIC is expected to support rapid, distributed development and testing of features"; to meet this expectation, many implementers have chosen to implement QUIC in user space, outside the operating system kernel, and to even distribute QUIC libraries with their own applications. It is worth noting that streaming operators using HTTP/3, carried over QUIC, can expect more frequent deployment of new congestion controller behavior than has been the case with HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, carried over TCP.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-10">It is worth considering that if TCP-based HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic are allowed to enter operator networks on roughly equal terms, questions of fairness and contention will be heavily dependent on interactions between the congestion controllers in use for TCP-based HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-1">The use of strong encryption does provide confidentiality for encrypted streaming media, from the sender to either the ultimate media consumer or to an intermediary that possesses  credentials allowing decryption. This does prevent deep packet inspection (DPI) by any on-path intermediary that does not possess credentials allowing decryption. However, even encrypted content streams may be vulnerable to traffic analysis. An on-path observer that can identify that encrypted traffic contains a media stream could "fingerprint" this encrypted media stream and then compare it against "fingerprints" of known content. The protection provided by strong encryption can be further lessened if a streaming media operator is repeatedly encrypting the same content. "Identifying HTTPS-Protected Netflix Videos in Real-Time" <xref target="CODASPY17" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CODASPY17"/> is an example of what is possible when identifying HTTPS-protected videos over TCP transport, based either on the length of entire resources being transferred or on characteristic packet patterns at the beginning of a resource being transferred. If traffic analysis is successful at identifying encrypted content and associating it with specific users, this tells an on-path observer what resource is being streamed, and by who, almost as certainly as examining decrypted traffic.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-2">Because HTTPS has historically layered HTTP on top of TLS, which is in turn layered on top of TCP, intermediaries have historically had access to unencrypted TCP-level transport information, such as retransmissions, and some carriers exploited this information in attempts to improve transport-layer performance <xref target="RFC3135" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3135"/>. The most recent standardized version of HTTPS, HTTP/3 <xref target="RFC9114" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9114"/>, uses the QUIC protocol <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/> as its transport layer. QUIC relies on the TLS 1.3 initial handshake <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446"/> only for key exchange <xref target="RFC9001" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9001"/> and encrypts almost all transport parameters itself, except for a few invariant header fields. In the QUIC short header, the only transport-level parameter that is sent "in the clear" is the Destination Connection ID <xref target="RFC8999" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8999"/>, and even in the QUIC long header, the only transport-level parameters sent "in the clear" are the version, Destination Connection ID, and Source Connection ID. For these reasons, HTTP/3 is significantly more "opaque" than HTTPS with HTTP/1 or HTTP/2.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-3"><xref target="RFC9312" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9312"/> discusses the manageability of the QUIC transport protocol that is used to encapsulate HTTP/3, focusing on the implications of QUIC's design and wire image on network operations involving QUIC traffic.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-2">Although the IETF has put considerable emphasis on end-to-end streaming media encryption, there are still important use cases that require the insertion of intermediaries.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-4">From a streaming media operator's perspective, a number of considerations are in play.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-5">If a streaming media operator does not actively work to avoid interception by on-path intermediaries, the effect will be indistinguishable from "impersonation attacks", and endpoints cannot be assured of any level of confidentiality and cannot trust that the content received came from the expected sender.</t>

        </dl>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-8">A streaming media operator's choice of whether to involve intermediaries requires careful consideration. As an example, when ABR manifests were commonly sent unencrypted, some access network operators would modify manifests during peak hours by removing high-bitrate renditions to prevent players from choosing those renditions, thus reducing the overall bandwidth consumed for delivering these media streams and thereby reducing the network load and improving the average user experience for their customers.
Now that ubiquitous encryption typically prevents this kind of modification, a streaming media operator who used intermediaries in the past, and who now wishes to maintain the same level of network health and user experience, must choose between adding intermediaries who are authorized to change the manifests or adding some other form of complexity to their service.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   ("Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time") uses recent
   measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate, round-trip
   time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network
   path.  BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends
   data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the
   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control
   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC8312], BBR offers
   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers
   or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for
   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding "bufferbloat").  BBR can be
   implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery
   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are available
   for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies version
   2 of the BBR algorithm, also sometimes referred to as BBRv2 or bbr2.

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

When both sides of an SCTP association support this extension, it can be used by an SCTP implementation to provide partially reliable data transmission service to an upper layer protocol.  This memo describes the protocol extensions, which consist of a new parameter for INIT and INIT ACK, and a new FORWARD TSN chunk type, and provides one example of a partially reliable service that can be provided to the upper layer via this mechanism.

            <t indent="0">This memo captures and expands upon the basic framework defined in RFC 2833, but retains only the most basic event codes. It sets up an IANA registry to which other event code assignments may be added. Companion documents add event codes to this registry relating to modem, fax, text telephony, and channel-associated signalling events. The remainder of the event codes defined in RFC 2833 are conditionally reserved in case other documents revive their use.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document provides a number of clarifications to the original document. However, it specifically differs from RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all compliant implementations support the DTMF events. Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support. This memo adds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework: subdivision of long events into segments, reporting of multiple events in a single packet, and the concept and reporting of state events.

The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <t indent="0">This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t indent="0">RFC 5681 documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion control algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.  RFC 5681 explicitly allows certain modifications of these algorithms, including modifications that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option (RFC 2883), and modifications that respond to "partial acknowledgments" (ACKs that cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected) in the absence of SACK.  This document describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as "NewReno".  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey Hoe.  This document obsoletes RFC 3782. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that seeks to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on that path.  LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than standard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to yield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference with the network performance of competing flows.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

          <title>Multimedia Congestion Control: Circuit Breakers for Unicast RTP Sessions</title>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience. The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload. At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm. It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion. It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers. To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</t>

            <t indent="0">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
            <t indent="0">Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
            <t indent="0">Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Lower- Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB). The primary objective of this LE PHB is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic and may preempt it. Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE PHB can be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge otherwise-unused resources only. There are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk data transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups, larger software updates, web search engines while gathering information from web servers and so on. This document recommends a standard Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE PHB.</t>
            <t indent="0">This specification obsoletes RFC 3662 and updates the DSCP recommended in RFCs 4594 and 8325 to use the DSCP assigned in this specification.</t>

            <t indent="0">In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to be able to manipulate some parameters in Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees.  This document defines a cryptographic transform for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that uses two separate but related cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document defines how to compress Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) headers using the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework.  SCHC defines a header compression mechanism adapted for Constrained Devices.  SCHC uses a static description of the header to reduce the header's redundancy and size.  While RFC 8724 describes the SCHC compression and fragmentation framework, and its application for IPv6/UDP headers, this document applies SCHC to CoAP headers.  The CoAP header structure differs from IPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible header with a variable number of options, themselves of variable length.  The CoAP message format is asymmetric: the request messages have a header format different from the format in the response messages.  This specification gives guidance on applying SCHC to flexible headers and how to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient compression Rules.</t>

            <t indent="0">To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such encryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol ossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport protocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current operational practice in some networks inspect transport header information within the network, but this is no longer possible when those transport headers are encrypted.</t>

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.  This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>
