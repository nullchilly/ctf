This document describes a\r\nmechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information\r\nto the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to\r\nthe DHCP client.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 3315 (DHCPv6) by making explicit the\r\nimplicit requirement that relay agents not modify the content of\r\nencapsulation payloads as they are relayed back toward clients.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"December 2011","keywords":["[--------]","DHCPv6 Relay","DHCPv6 option"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3315"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6422","errata_url":null}
