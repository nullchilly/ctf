When\r\nused on the link to the signaling router, the signaling of this\r\nreverse metric (RM) allows a router to influence the amount of\r\ntraffic flowing towards itself. In certain use cases, this enables\r\nrouters to maintain symmetric metrics on both sides of a link between\r\nthem.","pub_date":"December 2022","keywords":["IGP","OSPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9339","errata_url":null}
