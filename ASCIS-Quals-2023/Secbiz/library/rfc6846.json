The profile, called ROHC-TCP,\r\nprovides efficient and robust compression of TCP headers, including\r\nfrequently used TCP options such as selective acknowledgments (SACKs)\r\nand Timestamps.\r\n\r\nROHC-TCP works well when used over links with significant error rates\r\nand long round-trip times.  For many bandwidth-limited links where\r\nheader compression is essential, such characteristics are common.\r\n\r\nThis specification obsoletes RFC 4996.  It fixes a technical issue\r\nwith the SACK compression and clarifies other compression methods\r\nused.
