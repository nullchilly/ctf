When tunneled, a CAPWAP Data\r\nChannel is used for tunneling.  In many deployments, encapsulating\r\ndata frames to an entity other than the AC (for example, to an Access\r\nRouter (AR)) is desirable.  Furthermore, it may also be desirable to\r\nuse different tunnel encapsulation modes between the WTP and the\r\nAccess Router.  This document defines an extension to the CAPWAP\r\nprotocol that supports this capability and refers to it as alternate\r\ntunnel encapsulation.  The alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1)\r\nthe WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different\r\nfrom the AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known\r\nencapsulation types, such as IP-IP, IP-GRE, or CAPWAP.  The WTP may\r\nadvertise support for alternate tunnel encapsulation during the\r\ndiscovery and join process, and the AC may select one of the\r\nsupported alternate tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the\r\nWTP.","pub_date":"April 2018","keywords":["Wi-Fi","WLAN","PMIP","GRE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8350","errata_url":null}
