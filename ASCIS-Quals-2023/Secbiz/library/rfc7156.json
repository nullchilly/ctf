The term\r\n\"localized routing\" refers to a method by which packets are routed\r\ndirectly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node\r\n(CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment,\r\nit may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing\r\nsessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring\r\nthat the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to\r\naccomplish this using the Diameter protocol.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7156","errata_url":null}
