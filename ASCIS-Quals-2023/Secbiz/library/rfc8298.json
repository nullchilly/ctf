The solution conforms to\r\nthe packet conservation principle and uses a hybrid loss-and-delay-\r\nbased congestion control algorithm.  The algorithm is evaluated over\r\nboth simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a Long\r\nTerm Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to achieve both\r\nlow latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["Cellular Network","Congestion Control","RTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8298","errata_url":null}
