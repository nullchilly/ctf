It defines recommendations and\r\nrequirements for the use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a zero UDP\r\nchecksum.  It describes the issues and design principles that need to\r\nbe considered when UDP is used with IPv6 to support tunnel\r\nencapsulations, and it examines the role of the IPv6 UDP transport\r\nchecksum.  The document also identifies issues and constraints for\r\ndeployment on network paths that include middleboxes.  An appendix\r\npresents a summary of the trade-offs that were considered in\r\nevaluating the safety of the update to RFC 2460 that changes the use\r\nof the UDP checksum with IPv6.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6936","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6936"}
