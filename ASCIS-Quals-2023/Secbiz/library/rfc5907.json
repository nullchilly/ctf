As time synchronization is more and more a\r\nmission-critical service, standardized means for monitoring and\r\nmanagement of this subsystem of a networked host are required to\r\nallow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that\r\nis platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a\r\nstandardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity\r\nof such a network participant and it is part of the NTP version 4\r\nstandardization effort.
