HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and\r\nmaintain shared IP-layer state, allowing separation of the identifier\r\nand locator roles of IP addresses, thereby enabling continuity of\r\ncommunications across IP address changes.  HIP is based on a\r\nDiffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new\r\nHost Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication.  The protocol\r\nis designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and\r\nman-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  When used together with another\r\nsuitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating Security\r\nPayload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional\r\nencryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by\r\nthe IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.  It also incorporates\r\nlessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["HIP","IP-layer state","integrity protection","optional encryption"],"obsoletes":["RFC5201"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8002","RFC9374"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7401","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7401"}
