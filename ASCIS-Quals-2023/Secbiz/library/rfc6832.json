A fundamental property of LISP-speaking sites is that\r\nthey use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP\r\naddresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic they\r\nemit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or\r\nIPv6 addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the global\r\nrouting system, so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non-\r\nLISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites.\r\nThis document introduces three such mechanisms.  The first uses a new\r\nnetwork element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ITR), to\r\nact as an intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP-\r\nspeaking hosts.  Second, this document adds Network Address\r\nTranslation (NAT) functionality to LISP ITRs and LISP Egress Tunnel\r\nRouters (ETRs) to substitute routable IP addresses for non-routable\r\nEIDs.  Finally, this document introduces the Proxy Egress Tunnel\r\nRouter (Proxy-ETR) to handle cases where a LISP ITR cannot send\r\npackets to non-LISP sites without encapsulation.  This document defines \r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6832","errata_url":null}
