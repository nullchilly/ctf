Network-based mobility management support is\r\nprovided for those delegated IP prefixes just as it is provided for\r\nthe mobile node's home address.  Even if the mobile router performs a\r\nhandoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support\r\nis ensured for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes\r\nin the mobile network that use IP address configuration from those\r\ndelegated IP prefixes.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["Prefix Delegation","Proxy Mobile IPv6","PMIPv6","Mobile Router"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7148","errata_url":null}
