This architecture assumes that the Network\r\nAccess Server (NAS) acts as both a DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS\r\nclient.  When receiving messages from the DHCPv6 clients, the NAS\r\nconsults the RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response when\r\nforwarding the DHCPv6 client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The\r\nDHCPv6 server then uses that additional information to generate an\r\nappropriate response to the DHCPv6 client's requests.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":["DHCPv6","RADIUS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7037","errata_url":null}
