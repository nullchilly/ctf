Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)\r\nmembers also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as\r\npart of an update to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support\r\nActivity (IASA). This memo specifies that the Trustees shall be\r\nselected separately.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 4371.  The changes relate only to the\r\nselection of Trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as\r\nthey are today.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC4371"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0101"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8714","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8714"}
