This allows two IKE peers to establish\r\nsingle-side authenticated or mutual unauthenticated IKE sessions for\r\nthose use cases where a peer is unwilling or unable to authenticate\r\nor identify itself.  This ensures IKEv2 can be used for Opportunistic\r\nSecurity (also known as Opportunistic Encryption) to defend against\r\nPervasive Monitoring attacks without the need to sacrifice anonymity.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["unauthenticated","opportunistic security","pervasive monitoring","Peer Authorization Database","PAD","opportunistic encryption"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4301"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7619","errata_url":null}
