This profile allows clients (especially those that are\r\nconstrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas)\r\nto efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail.\r\nThis includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to\r\ndownload and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to\r\nefficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nThe Internet Email to Support Diverse Service Environments (Lemonade)\r\nprofile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail Submission protocols;\r\nspecifically, the URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol (RFC 3501)\r\nextensions and the BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 4409).
