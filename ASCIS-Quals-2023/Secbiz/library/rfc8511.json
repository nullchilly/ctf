This can cause noticeable performance\r\ndegradation for TCP connections traversing such a bottleneck,\r\nespecially if there are only a few flows or their bandwidth-delay\r\nproduct (BDP) is large.  The reception of a Congestion Experienced\r\n(CE) Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mark indicates that an\r\nAQM mechanism is used at the bottleneck, and the bottleneck network\r\nqueue is therefore likely to be short.  Feedback of this signal\r\nallows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to\r\nreduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the\r\ncongestion control algorithm's reaction to inferred packet loss.\r\nTherefore, this specification defines an experimental change to the\r\nTCP reaction specified in RFC 3168, as permitted by RFC 8311.","pub_date":"December 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8511","errata_url":null}
