This is done\r\nin order to remove interdependencies among the registries, thus\r\nmaking it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints are available\r\nfor assignment in which registries.  This document also clarifies the\r\ninformation that must be provided to IANA when requesting an\r\nallocation from one or more of these registries.  These changes are\r\ncompatible with the existing allocations and thus do not affect\r\nprotocol implementations.  The changes will, however, impact the\r\n\"IANA Considerations\" sections of future protocol specifications.\r\nThis document updates RFC 4360 and RFC 5701.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["Border Gateway Protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4360","RFC5701"],"updated_by":["RFC9184"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7153","errata_url":null}
