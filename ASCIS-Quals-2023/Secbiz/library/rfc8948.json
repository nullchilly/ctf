In 2017, the IEEE published a new standard (IEEE Std 802c) with\r\na new optional Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP). It specifies\r\ndifferent assignment approaches in four specified regions of the\r\nlocal MAC address space. \r\n\r\nThe IEEE is developing protocols to assign addresses (IEEE P802.1CQ).\r\nThere is also work in the IETF on specifying a new mechanism that\r\nextends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC address assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a\r\nDHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant\r\nto the server so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the\r\nquadrant requested by the relay or client. A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD)\r\nis defined for this purpose.","pub_date":"December 2020","keywords":["IEEE 802c","ELI","SAI","AAI","MAC address","LLADDR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8948","errata_url":null}
