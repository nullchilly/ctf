One\r\nof the characteristics of the PIDF is that the document always needs\r\nto carry all presence information available for the presentity.  In\r\nsome environments where low bandwidth and high latency links can\r\nexist, it is often beneficial to limit the amount of transported\r\ninformation over the network.  This document introduces a new MIME\r\ntype that enables transporting of either only the changed parts or\r\nthe full PIDF-based presence information.
