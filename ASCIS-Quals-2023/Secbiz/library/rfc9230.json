This improves privacy of DNS operations by not\r\nallowing any one server entity to be aware of both the client IP\r\naddress and the content of DNS queries and answers.\r\n\r\nThis experimental protocol has been developed outside the IETF and is\r\npublished here to guide implementation, ensure interoperability among\r\nimplementations, and enable wide-scale experimentation.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["Privacy","DNS Privacy","DoH","ODoH","HPKE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9230","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9230"}
