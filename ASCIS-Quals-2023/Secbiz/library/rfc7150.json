In PCEP, the path computation requests carry\r\ndetails of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC wishes\r\nthe PCE to apply in its computation.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information\r\nin PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Variable that\r\ncan be carried in any existing PCEP object.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7470"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7150","errata_url":null}
