Vyncke"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"6","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"There is a lack of IPv6 utilization in early 2009; this is partly\r\nlinked to the fact that the number of IPv6 nodes is rather low.  This\r\ndocument proposes to vastly increase the number of IPv6 hosts by\r\ntransforming all Social Networking platforms into IPv6 networks.\r\nThis will immediately add millions of IPv6 hosts to the existing IPv6\r\nInternet.  This document includes sections on addressing and\r\ntransport of IPv6 over a Social Network.  A working prototype has\r\nbeen developed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"1 April 2009","keywords":["[--------]","facebook"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5514","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5514"}
