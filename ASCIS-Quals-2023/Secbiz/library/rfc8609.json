This document specifies the encoding of CCNx messages in a\r\nTLV packet format, including the TLV types used by each message\r\nelement and the encoding of each value.  The semantics of CCNx\r\nmessages follow the encoding-independent CCNx Semantics\r\nspecification.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Information Centric Networking\r\nresearch group (ICNRG).  The document received wide review among\r\nICNRG participants and has two full implementations currently in\r\nactive use, which have informed the technical maturity of the\r\nprotocol specification.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8609","errata_url":null}
