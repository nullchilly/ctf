The second (NTS\r\nExtension Fields for NTPv4) handles encryption and authentication\r\nduring NTP time synchronization via extension fields in the NTP\r\npackets, and holds all required state only on the client via opaque\r\ncookies.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["Integrity","Authentication","NTP","Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8915","errata_url":null}
