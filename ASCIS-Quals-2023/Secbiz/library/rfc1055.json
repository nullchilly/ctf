Romkey"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"6","pub_status":"INTERNET STANDARD","status":"INTERNET STANDARD","source":"Legacy","abstract":" The TCP\/IP protocol family runs over a variety of network media: IEEE 802.3 (ethernet) and 802.5 (token ring) LAN's, X.25 lines, satellite links, and serial lines.  There are standard encapsulations for IP packets defined for many of these networks, but there is no standard for serial lines.  SLIP, Serial Line IP, is a currently a de facto standard, commonly used for point-to-point serial connections running TCP\/IP.  It is not an Internet standard.
