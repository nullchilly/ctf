Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via\r\nthe Hello subprotocol.  Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure\r\ntwo-way connectivity within time.  When a router restarts its OSPF\r\nsoftware, it may not know its neighbors.  If such a router sends a\r\nHello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the\r\nadjacency, which may not be desirable in certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThis memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism that allows OSPF\r\nrouters to inform their neighbors about the restart process.  Note\r\nthat this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.  The\r\nmechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful\r\nOSPF Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence.  It is\r\nimplemented\/supported by at least one major vendor and is currently deployed in\r\nthe field.  The purpose of this document is to capture the details of\r\nthis mechanism for public use.  This mechanism is not an IETF\r\nstandard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2007","keywords":["open shortest path first"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4812","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4812"}
