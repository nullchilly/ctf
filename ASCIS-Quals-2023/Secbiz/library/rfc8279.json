It provides optimal forwarding of multicast\r\npackets through a \"multicast domain\".  However, it does not require a\r\nprotocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor\r\ndoes it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.\r\nThis architecture is known as \"Bit Index Explicit Replication\"\r\n(BIER).  When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress\r\nrouter determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs\r\nto be sent.  The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a\r\nBIER header.  The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit\r\nrepresents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the\r\npacket to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to\r\nthose routers are set in the BIER header.  The procedures for\r\nforwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this\r\ndocument.  Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit\r\ntree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification.","pub_date":"November 2017","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8279","errata_url":null}
