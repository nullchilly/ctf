Hierarchical mobility\r\nmanagement for Mobile IPv6 is designed to reduce the amount of\r\nsignalling between the Mobile Node, its Correspondent Nodes, and its\r\nHome Agent.  The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) described in this\r\ndocument can also be used to improve the performance of Mobile IPv6 in\r\nterms of handover speed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["internet protocol version 6","neighbour discovery","neighbor discovery","mobility anchor point","map"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5380"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4140","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4140"}
