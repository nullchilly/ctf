It does so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each\r\nconnecting a CE device with a Provider Edge (PE) device) to a\r\npseudowire (connecting the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment\r\nCircuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet or\r\nboth ATM), and the pseudowire must carry the frames of that\r\ntechnology.  However, if it is known that the frames' payload\r\nconsists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a\r\npoint-to-point connection in which the pseudowire connects\r\nAttachment Circuits of different technologies.  This requires the\r\nPEs to perform a function known as \"Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)\r\nMediation\".  ARP Mediation refers to the process of resolving Layer 2\r\naddresses when different resolution protocols are used on either\r\nAttachment Circuit.  The methods described in this document are\r\napplicable even when the CEs run a routing protocol between\r\nthem, as long as the routing protocol runs over IP.
