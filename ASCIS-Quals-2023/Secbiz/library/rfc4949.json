The 334 pages of\r\nentries offer recommendations to improve the comprehensibility of\r\nwritten material that is generated in the Internet Standards Process\r\n(RFC 2026). The recommendations follow the principles that such\r\nwriting should (a) use the same term or definition whenever the same\r\nconcept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary\r\nsense; (c) use terms that are already well-established in open\r\npublications; and (d) avoid terms that either favor a particular\r\nvendor or favor a particular technology or mechanism over other,\r\ncompeting techniques that already exist or could be developed.
