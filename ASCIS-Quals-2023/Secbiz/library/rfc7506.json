While a generic \"Router shall examine packet\"\r\nOption Value is used for the IPv4 RAO, there is no generic RAO value\r\ndefined for IPv6 that can be used.  This document allocates a new,\r\ngeneric IPv6 RAO value that can be used by MPLS Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM) tools, including the MPLS Echo\r\nRequest and MPLS Echo Reply messages for MPLS in IPv6 environments.\r\nConsequently, it updates RFC 4379.\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation to request an IPv6 RAO value for MPLS OAM\r\ncomes from the MPLS LSP Ping\/Traceroute.  However, this value is\r\napplicable to all MPLS OAM and not limited to MPLS LSP Ping\/\r\nTraceroute.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["IPv6","LSP Ping","MPLS OAM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4379"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7506","errata_url":null}
