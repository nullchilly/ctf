It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to\r\nprovide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers\r\nthrough a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.  PCE is a\r\ncandidate solution for such requirements.\r\n\r\nThe PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication\r\nprotocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs.
