This set of\r\nstate machines shows how EAP can be implemented to support deployment\r\nin either a peer\/authenticator or peer\/authenticator\/AAA Server\r\nenvironment.  The peer and\r\nstand-alone authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP\r\nprotocol defined in RFC 3748 may be implemented.  The backend and\r\nfull\/pass-through authenticators illustrate how EAP\/AAA protocol\r\nsupport defined in RFC 3579 may be implemented.  Where there are\r\ndifferences, RFC 3748 and RFC 3579 are authoritative.\r\n\r\nThe state machines are based on the EAP \"Switch\"\r\nmodel.  This model includes events and actions for the interaction\r\nbetween the EAP Switch and EAP methods.  A brief description of the\r\nEAP \"Switch\" model is given in the Introduction section.\r\n\r\nThe state machine and associated model are informative only.\r\nImplementations may achieve the same results using different methods.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["eap stand-alone authenticator","eap backend authenticator","eap full authenticator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4137","errata_url":null}
