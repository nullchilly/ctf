The\r\ninformation distributed using OSPF TE Metric Extensions can then be\r\nused to make path selection decisions based on network performance.\r\n\r\nNote that this document only covers the mechanisms by which network\r\nperformance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring\r\nnetwork performance information or using that information, once\r\ndistributed, are outside the scope of this document.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7471","errata_url":null}
