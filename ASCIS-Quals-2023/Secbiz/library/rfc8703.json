The core specification of the protocol (RFC\r\n8175) assumes that every modem in the radio network has an attached\r\nDLEP router and requires that the Media Access Control (MAC) address\r\nof the DLEP interface on the attached router be used to identify the\r\ndestination in the network, for purposes of reporting the state and\r\nquality of the link to that destination.  \r\n\r\nThis document describes a DLEP extension that allows modems that do\r\nnot meet the strict requirement above to use DLEP to describe link\r\navailability and quality to one or more destinations reachable beyond\r\na device on the Layer 2 domain.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["DLEP","MANET","Link-Aware","Radio-Aware"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8703","errata_url":null}
