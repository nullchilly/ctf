The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute\r\nthe customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and\r\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer\r\npackets across the provider's backbone.  This is known as a \"BGP\/MPLS\r\nIP VPN\".  The base specification for BGP\/MPLS IP VPNs presumes that\r\nthe routing protocol on the interface between a PE router and a CE\r\nrouter is BGP.  This document extends that specification by allowing\r\nthe routing protocol on the PE\/CE interface to be the Open Shortest\r\nPath First (OSPF) protocol.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 4364.
