The goal is to contribute\r\ntowards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and\r\nfunctionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further\r\ndefinition of associated research and engineering problems and their\r\nsolutions. \r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research\r\nGroup (NMRG). It reflects the consensus of the research group, having\r\nreceived many detailed and positive reviews by research group\r\nparticipants.  It is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2022","keywords":["Autonomic networking","Network management","Intent-based management","Intent-based management","Policy-based management","policy","policy-based network management","abstraction"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9315","errata_url":null}
