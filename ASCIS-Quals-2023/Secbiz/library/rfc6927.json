(The authors note that there\r\nare many conflicting definitions for the term \"variant\" in the IDNA\r\ncommunity.)  This document surveys the approaches that top-level\r\ndomains have taken to the registration and provisioning of domain\r\nnames that have variants.  This document is not a product of the\r\nIETF, does not propose any method to make variants work \"correctly\",\r\nand is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":["DNS","variant","TLDs"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6927","errata_url":null}
