The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part\r\nof the specification for the GSM and are also now incorporated by the\r\n3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP\r\nspecification for GSM, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\r\n(UMTS), and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.  The IMEI and\r\nIMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment within these\r\nsystems and are managed by the GSMA.  URNs from this namespace almost\r\nalways contain personally identifiable information and need to be\r\ntreated accordingly.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["GSM","UMTS","LTE","3GPP","Mobile","identifier","instance ID"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7254","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7254"}
