The format encodes all commands that may legally appear on\r\na MIDI 1.0 DIN cable.  The format is suitable for interactive\r\napplications (such as network musical performance) and\r\ncontent-delivery applications (such as file streaming).  The format\r\nmay be used over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines\r\ntools for graceful recovery from packet loss.  Stream behavior,\r\nincluding the MIDI rendering method, may be customized during session\r\nsetup.  The format also serves as a mode for the mpeg4-generic format,\r\nto support the MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General MIDI,\r\nDownloadable Sounds Level 2, and Structured Audio.
