      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This document summarizes some research challenges for coping with
      natural or human-generated, large-scale disasters. In particular, the
      document discusses potential research directions for applying
      Information-Centric Networking (ICN) to address these challenges.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">
   Research and standardization approaches exist (for instance, see the work
   and discussions in the concluded IRTF DTN Research Group <xref target="dtnrg" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="dtnrg"/> and in the IETF DTN Working Group <xref target="dtnwg" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="dtnwg"/>). In addition, a published Experimental
   RFC in the IRTF Stream <xref target="RFC5050" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5050"/> discusses
   Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN), which is a key necessity for communicating
   in the disaster scenarios we are considering in this
   document. 'Disconnection tolerance' can thus be achieved with these
   existing DTN approaches.


However, while these approaches can provide independence from an existing
communication infrastructure (which indeed may not work anymore after a
disaster has happened), ICN offers key concepts, such as new naming schemes
and innovative multicast communication, which together enable many essential
(publish/subscribe-based) use cases for communication after a disaster (e.g.,
message prioritization, one-to-many delivery of messages, group communication
among rescue teams, and the use cases discussed in <xref target="usecases" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>). One could add such features to existing DTN protocols and
solutions; however, in this document, we explore the use of ICN as a starting
point for building a communication architecture that supports (somewhat
limited) communication capabilities after a disaster. We discuss the
relationship between the ICN approaches (for enabling communication after a
disaster) discussed in this document with existing work from the DTN community
in more depth in <xref target="researchgap" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.3"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">'Emergency Support and Disaster Recovery' is also listed among the
      ICN Baseline Scenarios in <xref target="RFC7476" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7476"/> as a
      potential scenario that 'can be used as a base for the evaluation of
      different ICN approaches so that they
      can be tested and compared against each other while showcasing their own
      advantages' <xref target="RFC7476" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7476"/> . In this regard,
      this document complements <xref target="RFC7476" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7476"/> by
      investigating the use of ICN approaches for 'Emergency Support and
      Disaster Recovery' in depth and discussing the relationship to existing
      work in the DTN community.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document focuses on ICN-based approaches that can enable
      communication after a disaster. These approaches reside mostly on the
      network layer. Other solutions for 'Emergency Support and Disaster
      Recovery' (e.g., on the application layer) may complement the ICN-based
      networking approaches discussed in this document and expand the solution
      space for enabling communications among users after a disaster. In fact,
      addressing the use cases explored in this document would require
      corresponding applications that would exploit the discussed ICN benefits
      on the network layer for users. However, the discussion of
      applications or solutions outside of the network layer are outside
      the scope of this document.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">An enormous earthquake hit Northeastern Japan (Tohoku areas) on March
      11, 2011 and caused extensive damages, including blackouts, fires,
      tsunamis, and a nuclear crisis. The lack of information and means of
      communication caused the isolation of several Japanese cities. This
      impacted the safety and well-being of residents and affected rescue
      work, evacuation activities, and the supply chain for food and other
      essential items. Even in the Tokyo area, which  is 300 km away from the
      Tohoku area, more than 100,000 people became 'returner refugees' who
      could not reach their homes because they had no means of public
      transportation (the Japanese government has estimated that more than 6.5
      million people would become returner refugees if such a catastrophic
      disaster were to hit the Tokyo area). 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">That earthquake in Japan also showed that the current network is
      vulnerable to disasters. Mobile phones have become the lifelines for
      communication, including safety confirmation. Besides (emergency) phone
      calls, services in mobile networks commonly being used after a disaster
      include network disaster SMS notifications (or SMS 'Cell Broadcast'
      <xref target="cellbroadcast" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="cellbroadcast"/>), available in most
      cellular networks. The aftermath of a disaster puts a high strain on
      available resources due to the need for communication by
      everyone. Authorities, such as the president or prime minister, local
      authorities, police, fire brigades, and rescue and medical personnel,
      would like to inform the citizens of possible shelters, food, or even of
      impending danger. Relatives would like to communicate with each other
      and be informed about their well-being. Affected citizens would like to
      make inquiries about food distribution centers and shelters or report trapped
      and missing people to the authorities. Moreover, damage to communication
      equipment, in addition to the already existing heavy demand for
      communication, highlights the issue of fault tolerance and energy
      efficiency. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">Additionally, disasters caused by humans (i.e., disasters that are caused deliberately
      and willfully and have the element of human intent such as a terrorist attack)
      may need to be considered. In such cases, the
      perpetrators could be actively harming the network by launching a
      denial-of-service attack or by monitoring the network passively to
      obtain information exchanged, even after the main disaster itself has
      taken place. Unlike some natural disasters that are 
      predictable to a small extent using weather forecasting technologies, may have a slower
      onset, and occur in known geographical regions and seasons, terrorist
      attacks almost always occur suddenly without any advance
      warning. Nevertheless, there exist many commonalities between natural
      and human-induced disasters, particularly relating to response and
      recovery, communication, search and rescue, and coordination of
      volunteers. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4"> The timely dissemination of information generated and requested by
      all the affected parties during and in the immediate aftermath of a
      disaster is difficult to provide within the current context of global
      information aggregators (such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.) that need to
      index the vast amounts of specialized information related to the
      disaster. Specialized coverage of the situation and timely dissemination
      are key to successfully managing disaster situations. We believe that
      network infrastructure capabilities provided by Information-Centric
      Networks can be suitable, in conjunction with application and middleware
      assistance.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-1">Given a disaster scenario as described in <xref target="disaster" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>, on a high level, one can derive the following
	(incomplete) list of corresponding technical challenges:
        </t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="3" pn="section-3.1-2">
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.1">Enabling usage of functional parts of the infrastructure, even
	  when these are disconnected from the rest of the network:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.2">Assuming
	  that parts of the network infrastructure (i.e., cables/links,
	  routers, mobile bases stations, etc.) are functional after a disaster
	  has taken place, it is desirable to be able to continue using such
	  components for communication as much as possible. This is
	  challenging when these components are disconnected from the
	  backhaul, thus forming fragmented networks. This is especially true
	  for today's mobile networks, which are comprised of a centralized
	  architecture, mandating connectivity to central entities (which are
	  located in the core of the mobile network) for communication. But
	  also in fixed networks, access to a name resolution service is often
	  necessary to access some given content.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.3">Decentralized authentication, content integrity, and trust:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.4">In
	  mobile networks, users are authenticated via central entities. While
	  special services important in a disaster scenario exist and may work
	  without authentication (such as SMS 'Cell Broadcast' <xref target="cellbroadcast" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="cellbroadcast"/> or emergency calls),
	  user-to-user (or user-to-authorities) communication is normally not
	  possible without being authenticated via a central entity in the
	  network. In order to communicate in fragmented or disconnected parts
	  of a mobile network, the challenge of decentralizing user
	  authentication arises. Independently of the network being fixed or
	  mobile, data origin authentication and verifying the correctness of
	  content retrieved from the network may be challenging when being
	  'offline' (e.g., potentially disconnected from content publishers as
	  well as from servers of a security infrastructure, which can provide
	  missing certificates in a certificate chain or up-to-date
	  information on revoked keys/certificates). As the network suddenly
	  becomes fragmented or partitioned, trust models may shift
	  accordingly to the change in authentication infrastructure being
	  used (e.g., one may switch from a PKI to a web-of-trust model, such
	  as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)). Note that blockchain-based approaches are, in most cases,
	  likely not suitable for the disaster scenarios considered in this
	  document, as the communication capabilities needed to find consensus
	  for a new block as well as for retrieving blocks at nodes 
	  will presumably not be available (or too excessive for the remaining
	  infrastructure) after a disaster.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.5">Delivering/obtaining information and traffic prioritization in
	  congested networks: </dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.6">Due to broken cables, failed routers, etc., it
	  is likely that the communication network has
	  much less overall capacity for handling traffic in a disaster scenario. Thus, significant
	  congestion can be expected in parts of the infrastructure. It is
	  therefore a challenge to guarantee message delivery in such a
	  scenario. This is even more important because, in the case of a disaster
	  aftermath, it may be crucial to deliver certain information to
	  recipients (e.g., warnings to citizens) with higher priority than
	  other content.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.7">Delay/disruption-tolerant approach:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.8">Fragmented networks make it
	  difficult to support direct end-to-end communication with small or
	  no delay. However, communication in general and especially during a
	  disaster can often tolerate some form of delay. For example, in order to
	  know if someone's relatives are safe or not, a corresponding
	  emergency message need not necessarily be supported in an end-to-end
	  manner but would also be helpful to the human recipient if it can
	  be transported in a hop-by-hop fashion with some delay. For these
	  kinds of use cases, it is sufficient to improve communication
	  resilience in order to deliver such important messages. </dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.9">Energy efficiency:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.10">Long-lasting power outages may lead to
	  batteries of communication devices running out, so designing
	  energy-efficient solutions is very important in order to maintain a
	  usable communication infrastructure.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.1-2.11">Contextuality:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.1-2.12">Like any communication in general, disaster
	  scenarios are inherently contextual. Aspects of geography, the
	  people affected, the rescue communities involved, the languages
	  being used, and many other contextual aspects are highly relevant for
	  an efficient realization of any rescue effort and, with it, the
	  realization of the required communication.</dd>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-1">Several aspects of ICN make related approaches attractive
	candidates for addressing the challenges described in <xref target="challenges" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>. Below is an (incomplete) list
	of considerations why ICN approaches can be beneficial to address
	these challenges:</t>
        <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="3" pn="section-3.2-2">
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.1">Routing-by-name:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.2">ICN protocols natively route by named data
	  objects and can identify objects by names, effectively moving the
	  process of name resolution from the application layer to the network
	  layer. This functionality is very handy in a fragmented network
	  where reference to location-based, fixed addresses may not work as a
	  consequence of disruptions. For instance, name resolution with ICN
	  does not necessarily rely on the reachability of application-layer
	  servers (e.g., DNS resolvers). In highly decentralized scenarios
	  (e.g., in infrastructureless, opportunistic environments), the ICN
	  routing-by-name paradigm effectively may lead to a
	  'replication-by-name' approach, where content is replicated
	  depending on its name.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.3">Integrity and authentication of named data objects:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.4">ICN is built
	  around the concept of named data objects. Several proposals exist
	  for integrating the concept of 'self-certifying data' into a naming
	  scheme (e.g., see <xref target="RFC6920" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6920"/>). With
	  such approaches, object integrity of data retrieved from the network
	  can be verified without relying on a trusted third party or PKI. 

  In addition, given that the correct object name is known, such schemes can
  also provide data origin authentication (for instance, see the usage example
  in <xref target="RFC6920" sectionFormat="of" section="8.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6920#section-8.3" derivedContent="RFC6920"/>).

</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.5">Content-based access control:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.6">
          ICN promotes a data-centric communication model that naturally
          supports content-based security (e.g., allowing access to content
          only to a specific user or class of users). In fact, in ICN, it is
          the content itself that is secured (encrypted), if desired, rather than the
          communication channel.  This functionality could facilitate trusted
          communications among peer users in isolated areas of the network
          where a direct communication channel may not always or continuously
          exist.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.7">Caching:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.8">Caching content along a delivery path is an inherent
	  concept in ICN. Caching helps in handling huge amounts of traffic
	  and can help to avoid congestion in the network (e.g., congestion in
	  backhaul links can be avoided by delivering content from caches at
	  access nodes).</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.9">Sessionless:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.10">ICN does not require full end-to-end
	  connectivity. This feature facilitates a seamless aggregation
	  between a normal network and a fragmented network, which needs
	  DTN-like message forwarding.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.11">Potential to run traditional IP-based services (IP-over-ICN):</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.12">While ICN and DTN promote the development of novel applications that
	  fully utilize the new capabilities of the ICN/DTN network, work in
	  <xref target="Trossen2015" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Trossen2015"/> has shown that an
	  ICN-enabled network can transport IP-based services, either directly
	  at IP or even at HTTP level. With this, IP- and ICN/DTN-based
	  services can coexist, providing the necessary support of legacy
	  applications to affected users while reaping any benefits from the
	  native support for ICN in future applications.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.2-2.13">Opportunities for traffic engineering and traffic
	  prioritization:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.2-2.14">ICN provides the possibility to perform traffic
	  engineering based on the name of desired content. This enables
	  priority-based replication depending on the scope of a given message
	  <xref target="Psaras2014" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Psaras2014"/>. In addition, as <xref target="Trossen2015" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Trossen2015"/>, among others, have pointed
	  out, the realization of ICN services and particularly of IP-based
	  services on top of ICN provide further traffic engineering
	  opportunities. The latter not only relate to the utilization of
	  cached content, as outlined before, but to the ability to flexibly
	  adapt to route changes (important in unreliable infrastructure, such
	  as in disaster scenarios), mobility support without anchor points
	  (again, important when parts of the infrastructure are likely to
	  fail), and the inherent support for multicast and multihoming
	  delivery.</dd>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-1">There has been quite some work in the DTN (Delay-Tolerant
	Networking) community on disaster communication (for instance, see
	the work and discussions in the concluded IRTF DTN Research
	Group <xref target="dtnrg" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="dtnrg"/> and in the IETF DTN
	Working Group <xref target="dtnwg" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="dtnwg"/>). However, most
	DTN work lacks important features, such as publish/subscribe (pub/sub)
	capabilities, caching, multicast delivery, and message prioritization
	based on content types, which are needed in the disaster scenarios we
	consider. One could add such features to existing DTN protocols and
	solutions, and indeed individual proposals for adding such features to
	DTN protocols have been made (e.g., <xref target="Greifenberg2008" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Greifenberg2008"/> and <xref target="Yoneki2007" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Yoneki2007"/>
	propose the use of a pub/sub-based multicast distribution
	infrastructure for DTN-based opportunistic networking
	environments).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">However, arguably ICN -- having these intrinsic properties (as also
	outlined above) -- makes a better starting point for building a
	communication architecture that works well before and after a
	disaster. For a disaster-enhanced ICN system, this would imply the
	following advantages: a) ICN data mules would have built-in caches and
	can thus return content for interests straight on, b) requests do not
	necessarily need to be routed to a source (as with existing DTN
	protocols), instead any data mule or end user can in principle respond
	to an interest, c) built-in multicast delivery implies
	energy-efficient, large-scale spreading of important information that
	is crucial in disaster scenarios, and d) pub/sub extension for popular
	ICN implementations exist <xref target="COPSS2011" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="COPSS2011"/>,
	which are very suitable for efficient group communication in disasters
	and provide better reliability, timeliness, and scalability, as compared
	to existing pub/sub approaches in DTN <xref target="Greifenberg2008" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Greifenberg2008"/> <xref target="Yoneki2007" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Yoneki2007"/> .</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-3">Finally, most DTN routing algorithms have been solely designed for
	particular DTN scenarios. By extending ICN approaches for DTN-like
	scenarios, one ensures that a solution works in regular
	(i.e., well-connected) settings just as well (which can be important in
	reality, where a routing algorithm should work before and after a
	disaster). It is thus reasonable to start with existing ICN approaches
	and extend them with the necessary features needed in disaster
	scenarios. In any case, solutions for disaster scenarios need a
	combination of ICN-features and DTN-capabilities.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-1">The research community has investigated ICN-based solutions to
	address the aforementioned challenges in disaster scenarios. Overall,
	the focus is on delivery of messages and not real-time
	communication. 

        While most users would probably like to conduct real-time voice/video
        calls after a disaster, in the extreme scenario we consider (with
        users being scattered over different fragmented networks as can be the
        case in the scenarios described in <xref target="disaster" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>), somewhat delayed message delivery appears to be
        inevitable, and full-duplex real-time communication seems infeasible
        to achieve (unless users are in close proximity).

        Thus, the assumption is that -- for a certain amount of time at least
        (i.e., the initial period until the regular communication
        infrastructure has been repaired) -- users would need to live with
        message delivery and publish/subscribe services but without real-time
        communication. Note, however, that a) in principle, ICN can support
        Voice over IP (VoIP) calls; thus, if users are in close proximity,
        (duplex) voice communication via ICN is possible <xref target="Gusev2015" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Gusev2015"/>, and b) delayed message delivery

	  'NREP', has been proposed <xref target="Psaras2014" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Psaras2014"/>, where ICN messages have attributes, such as

          A large-scale disaster can cause a large-scale blackout; thus, a
          number of base stations (BSs) will be operated by their batteries.

          Capacities of such batteries are not large enough to provide
          cellular communication for several days after the disaster. In order
          to prolong the batteries' life from one day to several days,
          different techniques need to be explored, including priority
          control, cell zooming, and collaborative upload. Cell zooming
          switches off some of the BSs because switching off is the only way
          to reduce power consumed at the idle time. In cell zooming, areas
          covered by such inactive BSs are covered by the active
          BSs. Collaborative communication is complementary to cell zooming
          and reduces power proportional to a load of a BS. The load
          represents cellular frequency resources. In collaborative
          communication, end devices delegate sending and receiving messages
          to and from a BS to a representative end device of which radio
          propagation quality is better. The design of an ICN-based
          publish/subscribe protocol that incorporates collaborative upload is
          ongoing work. In particular, the integration of collaborative upload

	  or a replica server. This calls for 'data-centric' security, where
	  security relies on information exclusively contained in the message
	  itself, or if extra information provided by trusted entities is
	  needed, this should be gathered through offline, asynchronous, and
	  noninteractive communication, rather than from an explicit online
	  interactive handshake with trusted servers. The ability to guarantee
	  security without any online entities is particularly important in
	  disaster scenarios with fragmented networks. One concrete
	  cryptographic technique is 'Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based
	  Encryption (CP-ABE)', allowing a party to encrypt a content
	  specifying a policy that  consists in a Boolean expression over
	  attributes that must be satisfied by those who want to decrypt such
	  content. Such encryption schemes tie confidentiality and
	  access control to the transferred data, which can also be transmitted
	  in an unsecured channel. These schemes enable the source to
	  specify the set of nodes allowed to later on decrypt the content
	  during the encryption process.</dd>
          <dt pn="section-5.1-2.11">Decentralized authentication of messages:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-5.1-2.12">Self-certifying names
	  provide the property that any entity in a distributed system can
	  verify the binding between a corresponding public key and the
	  self-certifying name without relying on a trusted third
	  party. Self-certifying names thus provide a decentralized form of
	  data origin authentication. However, self-certifying names lack a
	  binding with a corresponding real-world identity. Given the
	  decentralized nature of a disaster scenario, a PKI-based approach
	  for binding self-certifying names with real-world identities is not
	  feasible. Instead, a Web of Trust can be used to provide this
	  binding. Not only are the cryptographic signatures used within a
	  Web of Trust independent of any central authority, but there are also
	  technical means for making the inherent trust relationships of a
	  Web of Trust available to network entities in a decentralized,
	  'offline' fashion, such that information received can be assessed
	  based on these trust relationships. A concrete scheme for such an
	  approach has been published in <xref target="Seedorf2014" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Seedorf2014"/>, in which concrete examples for fulfilling the
	  use case 'Delivering Messages to Relatives/Friends' with this

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">This document does not define a new protocol (or protocol extension)
      or a particular mechanism; therefore, it introduces no specific new
      security considerations. General security considerations for
      ICN, which also apply when using ICN
      techniques to communicate after a disaster, are discussed
      in <xref target="RFC7945" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7945"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-2">The after-disaster communication scenario, which is the focus of this
      document, raises particular attention to decentralized authentication,
      content integrity, and trust as key research challenges (as outlined in
      <xref target="challenges" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>). The corresponding use
      cases and ICN-based research approaches discussed in this document thus
      imply certain security requirements. In particular, data origin
      authentication, data integrity, and access control are key requirements
      for many use cases in the aftermath of a disaster (see <xref target="usecases" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-3">In principle, the kinds of disasters discussed in this document can
      happen as a result of a natural disaster, accident, or
      human error. However, intentional actions can also cause such a disaster
      (e.g., a terrorist attack, as mentioned in <xref target="disaster" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>). In this case (i.e., intentionally caused disasters
      by attackers), special attention needs to be paid when re-enabling
      communications as temporary, somewhat unreliable communications with
      potential limited security features may be anticipated and abused by
      attackers (e.g., to circulate false messages to cause further
      intentional chaos among the human population, to leverage this less
      secure infrastructure to refine targeting, or to track the responses of
      security/police forces). Potential solutions on how to cope with
      intentionally caused disasters by attackers and on how to enable a
      secure communications infrastructure after an intentionally caused
      disaster are out of scope of this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-4">The use of data-centric security schemes, such as 'Ciphertext-Policy
      Attribute Based Encryption' (as mentioned in <xref target="suggested" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.1"/>), which encrypt the data itself (and not the
      communication channel), in principle, allows for the transmission of such
      encrypted data over an unsecured channel. However, metadata about
      the encrypted data being retrieved still arises. Such metadata may disclose
      sensitive information to a network-based attacker, even if such an
      attacker cannot decrypt the content itself.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-5">This document has summarized research directions for addressing these
      challenges and requirements, such as efforts in data-centric
      confidentiality and access control, as well as recent works for
      decentralized authentication of messages in a disaster-struck networking
      infrastructure with nonfunctional routing links and limited

      <name slugifiedName="name-conclusion">Conclusion</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">This document has outlined some research directions for
      ICN with respect to applying ICN
      approaches for 
      coping with natural or human-generated, large-scale disasters. The
      document has described high-level research challenges for enabling
      communication after a disaster has happened, as well as a general
      rationale why ICN approaches could be beneficial to address these
      challenges. Further, concrete use cases have been described and how
      these can be addressed with ICN-based approaches has been discussed.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">Finally, this document provides an overview of examples of existing
      ICN-based solutions that address the previously outlined research
      challenges. These concrete solutions demonstrate that indeed the
      communication challenges in the aftermath of a disaster can be addressed
      with techniques that have ICN paradigms at their base, validating our
      overall reasoning. However, further, more-detailed challenges exist, and
      more research is necessary in all areas discussed: efficient content
      distribution and routing in fragmented networks, traffic prioritization,
      security, and energy efficiency. An incomplete, high-level list of such
      open research challenges has concluded the document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3">In order to deploy ICN-based solutions for disaster-aftermath
      communication in actual mobile networks, standardized ICN baseline
      protocols are a must. It is unlikely to expect all user equipment in a
      large-scale mobile network to be from the same vendor. In this respect,
      the work being done in the IRTF ICNRG is very useful as it works toward
      standards for concrete ICN protocols that enable interoperability among
      solutions from different vendors. 

      These protocols -- currently being developed in the IRTF ICNRG as
      Experimental specifications in the IRTF Stream -- provide a good
      foundation for deploying ICN-based, disaster-aftermath communication and
      thereby address key use cases that arise in such situations (as outlined
      in this document).</t>
