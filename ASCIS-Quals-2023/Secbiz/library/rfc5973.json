This NSLP allows\r\nhosts to signal on the data path for NATs and firewalls to be\r\nconfigured according to the needs of the application data flows.  For\r\ninstance, it enables hosts behind NATs to obtain a publicly reachable\r\naddress and hosts behind firewalls to receive data traffic.  The\r\noverall architecture is given by the framework and requirements\r\ndefined by the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group.  The\r\nnetwork scenarios, the protocol itself, and examples for path-coupled\r\nsignaling are given in this memo.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["Next Steps in Signaling","NSIS","Path-coupled signaling","Middlebox"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5973","errata_url":null}
