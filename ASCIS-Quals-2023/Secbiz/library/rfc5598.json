These changes have been evolutionary, rather\r\nthan revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its\r\ninstalled base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on\r\nthis large and complex system, all participants need to work from a\r\ncommon view of it and use a common language to describe its\r\ncomponents and the interactions among them.  But the many differences\r\nin perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what\r\nanother participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of\r\nreference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail\r\narchitecture, reflecting the current service.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2009","keywords":["email","e-mail","service","mime","architecture","mta","mua","msa","mda","admd","user","originator","recipient","transfer","message transfer","deliver","delivery","relay","header","gateway agent","gateway actor","gateway","sieve","dsn","mdn","tussle","mhs","Message handling service","message transfer agent","message user agent","mail submission agent","mail delivery agent","administrative management domain"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5598","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5598"}
