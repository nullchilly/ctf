In this approach, all\r\nlegitimate router control plane traffic is identified.  Once\r\nlegitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed in the\r\nrouter's forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not\r\nspecifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's\r\ncontrol plane, or rate-limits such traffic to an acceptable level.\r\n\r\nNote that the filters described in this memo are applied only to\r\ntraffic that is destined for the router, and not to all traffic that\r\nis passing through the router.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["[--------]","ACL","Router Control Plane Protection","Filter"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6192","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6192"}
