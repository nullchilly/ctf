In such an environment, many\r\nconventions for defining identifiers are possible.  This document\r\ndefines identifiers for MPLS-TP management and Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions compatible with IP\/\r\nMPLS conventions.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) \/ International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\r\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\r\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\r\n(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\r\nof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.
