Abstract

   This document specifies a protocol for encapsulation of an arbitrary
   network layer protocol over another arbitrary network layer protocol.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   A number of different proposals [RFC1234, <a href="./rfc1226">RFC1226</a>] currently exist
   for the encapsulation of one protocol over another protocol. Other
   types of encapsulations [RFC1241, <a href="./rfc1479">RFC1479</a>] have been proposed for
   transporting IP over IP for policy purposes. This memo describes a
   protocol which is very similar to, but is more general than, the
   above proposals.  In attempting to be more general, many protocol
   specific nuances have been ignored. The result is that this proposal
   may be less suitable for a situation where a specific "X over Y"
   encapsulation has been described.  It is the attempt of this protocol
   to provide a simple, general purpose mechanism which reduces the
   problem of encapsulation from its current O(n^2) size to a more
   manageable size. This memo purposely does not address the issue of
   when a packet should be encapsulated.  This memo acknowledges, but
   does not address problems such as mutual encapsulation [<a href="./rfc1326" title="&quot;Mutual Encapsulation Considered Dangerous&quot;">RFC1326</a>].

   In the most general case, a system has a packet that needs to be
   encapsulated and delivered to some destination.  We will call this
   the payload packet.  The payload is first encapsulated in a GRE
   packet.  The resulting GRE packet can then be encapsulated in some
   other protocol and then forwarded.  We will call this outer protocol
   the delivery protocol. The algorithms for processing this packet are
   discussed later.

   Finally this specification describes the intersection of GRE
   currently deployed by multiple vendors.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, OPTIONAL, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED,
   SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT are to be interpreted as defined
   in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Structure of a GRE Encapsulated Packet</span>

   A GRE encapsulated packet has the form:

    ---------------------------------
    |                               |
    |       Delivery Header         |
    |                               |

    |                               |
    |       GRE Header              |
    |                               |
    ---------------------------------
    |                               |
    |       Payload packet          |
    |                               |
    ---------------------------------

   This specification is generally concerned with the structure of the
   GRE header, although special consideration is given to some of the
   issues surrounding IPv4 payloads.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a>. GRE Header</span>

   The GRE packet header has the form:

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc2784">RFC 2784</a>             Generic Routing Encapsulation            March 2000</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>. Checksum Present (bit 0)</span>

   If the Checksum Present bit is set to one, then the Checksum and the
   Reserved1 fields are present and the Checksum field contains valid
   information. Note that a compliant implementation MUST accept and
   process this field.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a>. Reserved0 (bits 1-12)</span>

   A receiver MUST discard a packet where any of bits 1-5 are non-zero,
   unless that receiver implements <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>. Bits 6-12 are reserved for
   future use. These bits MUST be sent as zero and MUST be ignored on
   receipt.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.3.1" href="#section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>. Version Number (bits 13-15)</span>

   The Version Number field MUST contain the value zero.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.4" href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>. Protocol Type (2 octets)</span>

   The Protocol Type field contains the protocol type of the payload
   packet. These Protocol Types are defined in [<a href="./rfc1700" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>] as "ETHER
   TYPES" and in [<a href="#ref-ETYPES">ETYPES</a>]. An implementation receiving a packet
   containing a Protocol Type which is not listed in [<a href="./rfc1700" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>] or
   [<a href="#ref-ETYPES">ETYPES</a>] SHOULD discard the packet.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.5" href="#section-2.5">2.5</a>. Checksum (2 octets)</span>

   The Checksum field contains the IP (one's complement) checksum sum of
   the all the 16 bit words in the GRE header and the payload packet.
   For purposes of computing the checksum, the value of the checksum
   field is zero. This field is present only if the Checksum Present bit
   is set to one.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-2.6" href="#section-2.6">2.6</a>. Reserved1 (2 octets)</span>

   The Reserved1 field is reserved for future use, and if present, MUST
   be transmitted as zero. The Reserved1 field is present only when the
   Checksum field is present (that is, Checksum Present bit is set to
   one).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>. IPv4 as a Payload</span>

   When IPv4 is being carried as the GRE payload, the Protocol Type
   field MUST be set to 0x800.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>. Forwarding Decapsulated IPv4 Payload Packets</span>

   When a tunnel endpoint decapsulates a GRE packet which has an IPv4
   packet as the payload, the destination address in the IPv4 payload
   packet header MUST be used to forward the packet and the TTL of the
   payload packet MUST be decremented. Care should be taken when
   forwarding such a packet, since if the destination address of the
   payload packet is the encapsulator of the packet (i.e., the other end
   of the tunnel), looping can occur. In this case, the packet MUST be
   discarded.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>. IPv4 as a Delivery Protocol</span>

   The IPv4 protocol 47 [<a href="./rfc1700" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>] is used when GRE packets are
   enapsulated in IPv4. See [<a href="./rfc1122" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet hosts - communication layers&quot;">RFC1122</a>] for requirements relating to the
   delivery of packets over IPv4 networks.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>. Interoperation with <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> Compliant Implementations</span>

   In <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>, the field described here as Reserved0 contained a number
   of flag bits which this specification deprecates. In particular, the
   Routing Present, Key Present, Sequence Number Present, and Strict
   Source Route bits have been deprecated, along with the Recursion
   Control field. As a result, the GRE header will never contain the
   Key, Sequence Number or Routing fields specified in <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>.

   There are, however, existing implementations of <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>. The
   following sections describe correct interoperation with such
   implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>. <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> Compliant Receiver</span>

   An implementation complying to this specification will transmit the
   Reserved0 field set to zero. An <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> compliant receiver will
   interpret this as having the Routing Present, Key Present, Sequence
   Number Present, and Strict Source Route bits set to zero, and will
   not expect the <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> Key, Sequence Number or Routing fields to be
   present.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>. <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> Compliant Transmitter</span>

   An <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> transmitter may set any of the Routing Present, Key
   Present, Sequence Number Present, and Strict Source Route bits set to
   one, and thus may transmit the <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a> Key, Sequence Number or
   Routing fields in the GRE header. As stated in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, a packet
   with non-zero bits in any of bits 1-5 MUST be discarded unless the
   receiver implements <a href="./rfc1701">RFC 1701</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   Security in a network using GRE should be relatively similar to
   security in a normal IPv4 network, as routing using GRE follows the
   same routing that IPv4 uses natively. Route filtering will remain
   unchanged. However packet filtering requires either that a firewall
   look inside the GRE packet or that the filtering is done on the GRE
   tunnel endpoints. In those environments in which this is considered
   to be a security issue it may be desirable to terminate the tunnel at
   the firewall.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   This section considers the assignment of additional GRE Version
   Numbers and Protocol Types.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  GRE Version Numbers</span>

   This document specifies GRE version number 0. GRE version number 1 is
   used by PPTP [<a href="./rfc2637" title="&quot;Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)&quot;">RFC2637</a>]. Additional GRE version numbers are assigned
   by IETF Consensus as defined in <a href="./rfc2434">RFC 2434</a> [<a href="./rfc2434" title="">RFC2434</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Protocol Types</span>

   GRE uses an ETHER Type for the Protocol Type. New ETHER TYPES are
   assigned by Xerox Systems Institute [<a href="./rfc1700" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>. Acknowledgments</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>. Appendix -- Known Issues</span>

   This document specifies the behavior of currently deployed GRE
   implementations. As such, it does not attempt to address the
   following known issues:

   o Interaction Path MTU Discovery (PMTU) [<a href="./rfc1191" title="&quot;Path MTU Discovery&quot;">RFC1191</a>]

     Existing implementations of GRE, when using IPv4 as the Delivery
     Header, do not implement Path MTU discovery and do not set the
     Don't Fragment bit in the Delivery Header.  This can cause large
     packets to become fragmented within the tunnel and reassembled at
     the tunnel exit (independent of whether the payload packet is using
     PMTU).  If a tunnel entry point were to use Path MTU discovery,
     however, that tunnel entry point would also need to relay ICMP
     unreachable error messages (in particular the "fragmentation needed
     and DF set" code) back to the originator of the packet, which is
     not a requirement in this specification. Failure to properly relay
     Path MTU information to an originator can result in the following
     behavior: the originator sets the don't fragment bit, the packet
     gets dropped within the tunnel, but since the originator doesn't
     receive proper feedback, it retransmits with the same PMTU, causing
     subsequently transmitted packets to be dropped.

   o IPv6 as Delivery and/or Payload Protocol

     This specification describes the intersection of GRE currently
     deployed by multiple vendors. IPv6 as delivery and/or payload
     protocol is not included in the currently deployed versions of GRE.

   o Interaction with ICMP

   o Interaction with the Differentiated Services Architecture

   o Multiple and Looping Encapsulations
