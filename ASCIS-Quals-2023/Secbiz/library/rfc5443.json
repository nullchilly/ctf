For such\r\napplications, it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol (IP)\r\nforwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately.\r\nBlackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the\r\nInterior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP is\r\nnot.  While the link could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not\r\nuseful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN applications or\r\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores.  This document\r\ndescribes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition\r\nwithout introducing any protocol changes.
