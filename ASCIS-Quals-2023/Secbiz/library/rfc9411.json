The main areas covered in this document are test\r\nterminology, test configuration parameters, and benchmarking\r\nmethodology for NGFWs and NGIPSs. (It is assumed that readers have a\r\nworking knowledge of these devices and the security functionality\r\nthey contain.) This document aims to improve the applicability,\r\nreproducibility, and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test\r\nmethodology with today's increasingly complex layer 7\r\nsecurity-centric network application use cases. As a result, this\r\ndocument makes RFC 3511 obsolete.","pub_date":"March 2023","keywords":["NGFW","NGIPS","benchmarking","performance testing","security testing"],"obsoletes":["RFC3511"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9411","errata_url":null}
