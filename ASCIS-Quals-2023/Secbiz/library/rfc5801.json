This is done by\r\ndefining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism\r\nfamily offers a number of improvements over the previous \"SASL\/\r\nGSSAPI\" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the\r\nauthentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of\r\nchannel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel\r\nbinding and mutual authentication are supported.
