This\r\ndocument attempts to give an overview of the various issues grouped\r\ninto three categories:\r\n\r\no  issues due to the IPv6 protocol itself,\r\no  issues due to transition mechanisms, and\r\no  issues due to IPv6 deployment.  \r\n\r\nThis memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2007","keywords":["internet protocol version 6","dual-protocol network","ipv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4942","errata_url":null}
