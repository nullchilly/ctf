The initiating LSR has\r\ninformation about the targeted applications to administratively\r\ncontrol initiation of the session.  However, the responding LSR has no\r\nsuch information to control acceptance of this session.  This document\r\ndefines a mechanism to advertise and negotiate the Targeted\r\nApplication Capability (TAC) during LDP session initialization.  As\r\nthe responding LSR becomes aware of targeted applications, it may\r\nestablish a limited number of tLDP sessions for certain applications.\r\nIn addition, each targeted application is mapped to LDP Forwarding\r\nEquivalence Class (FEC) elements to advertise only necessary LDP\r\nFEC label bindings over the session.  This document updates RFC 7473\r\nfor enabling advertisement of LDP FEC label bindings over the session.","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7473"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8223","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8223"}
