Meanwhile, the completion of the signaling\r\nprocess may be used by LSP users or applications that control their\r\nuse as an indication that the data path has become usable.  The\r\nexistence of the inconsistency between the signaling messages and\r\ncross-connection programming, and the possible failure of cross-\r\nconnection programming, if not properly treated, will result in data\r\nloss or even application failure.  Characterization of this\r\nperformance can thus help designers to improve the way in which LSPs\r\nare used and to make applications or tools that depend on and use\r\nLSPs more robust.  This document defines a series of performance\r\nmetrics to evaluate the connectivity of the data path in the\r\nsignaling process.
