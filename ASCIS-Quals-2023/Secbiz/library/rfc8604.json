This use case can\r\nbe applied to the interconnection of massive-scale Data Centers (DCs)\r\nand\/or large aggregation networks.  Forwarding tables of midpoint and\r\nleaf nodes only require a few tens of thousands of entries.  This may\r\nbe achieved by the inherently scaleable nature of Segment Routing and\r\nthe design proposed in this document.","pub_date":"June 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8604","errata_url":null}
