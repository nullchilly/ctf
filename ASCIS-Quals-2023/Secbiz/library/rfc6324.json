These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to\r\ntake advantage of inconsistencies between the IPv4 routing state and\r\nthe IPv6 routing state.  The attack forms a routing loop that can be\r\nabused as a vehicle for traffic amplification to facilitate denial-\r\nof-service (DoS) attacks.  The first aim of this document is to\r\ninform on this attack and its root causes.  The second aim is to\r\npresent some possible mitigation measures.  It should be noted that\r\nat the time of this writing there are no known reports of malicious\r\nattacks exploiting these vulnerabilities.  Nonetheless, these\r\nvulnerabilities can be activated by accidental misconfiguration.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2011","keywords":["Encapsulation","ISATAP","6rd"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6324","errata_url":null}
