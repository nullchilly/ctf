The intention of\r\nresetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream\r\nback to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application\r\nlayer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this\r\nfeature want it so that they can \"reuse\" streams for different\r\npurposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the\r\napplication can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature,\r\na new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater\r\nthan expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to \"reset the\r\nstreams back to zero\".  This document also includes methods for\r\nresetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional\r\nstreams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers.
