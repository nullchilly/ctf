This mechanism\r\nallows User Agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record\r\n(AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the\r\ncredential service, which returns an authenticated response\r\ncontaining that certificate.  The credential service also allows\r\nusers to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys. \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["[--------]","credential service","aor","address of record"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6072","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6072"}
