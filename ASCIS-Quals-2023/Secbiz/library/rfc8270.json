This RFC updates\r\nRFC 4419, which allowed for DH moduli less than 2048 bits; now, 2048\r\nbits is the minimum acceptable group size.\r\n","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["SSH","DH"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4419"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8270","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8270"}
