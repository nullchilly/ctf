It provides a mechanism to derive an optimum\r\nend-to-end path in a multi-domain environment by using a hierarchical\r\nrelationship between domains to select the optimum sequence of\r\ndomains and optimum paths across those domains.\r\n\r\nThis document defines extensions to the Path Computation Element\r\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) to support H-PCE procedures.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["Traffic Engineering","Inter-domain","Multi-domain"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8685","errata_url":null}
