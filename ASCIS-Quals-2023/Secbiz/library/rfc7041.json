Provider backbone bridging was defined by IEEE as a\r\nconnectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels.  PBB can be used\r\nto attain better scalability than Provider Bridges (PBs) in terms of the\r\nnumber of customer Media Access Control addresses and the number of service\r\ninstances that can be supported.\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) provides a framework for extending\r\nEthernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed\r\nMPLS backbone without running the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or\r\nthe Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) across the backbone.  As a result,\r\nVPLS has been deployed on a large scale in service provider networks.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model\r\nrequired to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the\r\nservice provider fit of the initial model.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7041","errata_url":null}
