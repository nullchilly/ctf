While the\r\nSynchronization Source (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may\r\nchange if a collision is detected or when the RTP application is\r\nrestarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so that RTP\r\nendpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP\r\nmedia streams.\r\n\r\nFor proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the\r\nparticipants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for\r\nchoosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard (RFC 3550) are\r\ninsufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to\r\nupdate those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP\r\nCNAMEs.  Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts\r\nof the new algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and\/or\r\nineffective.  This document addresses these concerns and replaces RFC\r\n6222.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6222"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3550"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7022","errata_url":null}
