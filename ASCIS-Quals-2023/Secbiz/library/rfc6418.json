This node receives configuration\r\ninformation from each of its provisioning domains, where some\r\nconfiguration objects are global to the node and others are local to\r\nthe interface.  Issues such as selecting the wrong interface to send\r\ntraffic happen when conflicting node-scoped configuration objects are\r\nreceived and inappropriately used.  Moreover, other issues are the\r\nresult of simultaneous attachment to multiple networks, such as\r\ndomain selection or addressing and naming space overlaps, regardless\r\nof the provisioning mechanism.  While multiple provisioning domains\r\nare typically seen on nodes with multiple interfaces, this document\r\nalso discusses situations involving single-interface nodes.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":["multi-homing","MIF","DNS","DHCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6418","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6418"}
