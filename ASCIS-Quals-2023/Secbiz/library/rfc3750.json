In order to evaluate the suitability of these mechanisms, we need to define the scenarios in which these mechanisms have to be used.  One specific scope is the \"unmanaged network\", which typically corresponds to a home or small office network.  The scenarios are specific to a single subnet, and are defined in terms of IP connectivity supported by the gateway and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  We first examine the generic requirements of four classes of applications: local, client, peer to peer and server.  Then, for each scenario, we infer transition requirements by analyzing the needs for smooth migration of applications from IPv4 to IPv6.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
