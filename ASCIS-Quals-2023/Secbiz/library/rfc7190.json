MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) has strongly discouraged\r\nthe use of multipath techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP\r\nOperations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot\r\nbe avoided when operating over many types of multipath\r\nimplementations.\r\n\r\nUsing MPLS Entropy Labels (RFC 6790), MPLS Label Switched Paths\r\n(LSPs) can be carried over multipath links while also providing a\r\nfully MPLS-TP-compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document\r\ndescribes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.\r\nThe use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also\r\ndiscussed.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["MPLS","composite link","link aggregation","ECMP","link bundling","multipath","MPLS-TP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7190","errata_url":null}
