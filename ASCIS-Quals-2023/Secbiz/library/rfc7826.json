RTSP provides an\r\nextensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of\r\nreal-time data, such as audio and video.  Sources of data can include\r\nboth live data feeds and stored clips.  This protocol is intended to\r\ncontrol multiple data delivery sessions; provide a means for choosing\r\ndelivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP, and TCP; and provide a\r\nmeans for choosing delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":["mmusic","RTSP","RTSP\/2.0","real-time streaming protocol"],"obsoletes":["RFC2326"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7826","errata_url":null}
