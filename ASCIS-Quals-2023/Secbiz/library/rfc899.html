                                 Notes

   This memo is a report on the Gateway Special Interest Group Meeting
   that was held at ISI on 28 and 29 February 1984.  Robert Hinden of
   BBNCC chaired, and Jon Postel of ISI hosted the meeting.
   Approximately 35 gateway designers and implementors attended.  These
   notes are based on the recollections of Jon Postel and Mike Muuss.
   Under each topic area are Jon Postel's brief notes, and additional
   details from Mike Muuss.  This memo is a report on a meeting.  No
   conclusions, decisions, or policy statements are documented in this
   note.

                                 Schedule

   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain
   Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is a partial update
   of <a href="./rfc881">RFC 881</a>.  The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for
   the implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.  The names of
   hosts will be changed to domain style names.  Hosts will begin to use
   domain style names on 14-Mar-84, and the use of old style names will
   be completely phased out before 2-May-84.  This applies to both the
   ARPA research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.  This is an
   official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.

   exchange routing information with some gateway of the core autonomous
   system using the Exterior Gateway Protocol.

   This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA Internet community.
   It describes a resource location protocol for use in the ARPA
   Internet.  It is most useful on networks employing technologies which
   support some method of broadcast addressing, however it may also be
   used on other types of networks.  For maximum benefit, all hosts
   which provide significant resources or services to other hosts on the
   Internet should implement this protocol.  Hosts failing to implement
   the Resource Location Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts
   which are attempting to locate resources on the Internet.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-854" href="#section-854">854</a>     Postel  </span>     May 83      Telnet Protocol Specifications

   This is the specification of the Telnet protocol used for remote
   terminal access in the ARPA Internet.  The purpose of the TELNET
   Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit
   byte oriented communications facility.  Its primary goal is to allow
   a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and
   terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the
   protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication
   ("linking") and process-process communication (distributed
   computation).   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet
   community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and
   implement this standard.  Obsoletes NIC 18639.

   This RFC specifies the ARPANET Short Blocking Feature, which will
   allow ARPANET  hosts to optionally shorten the IMP's host blocking
   timer.  This Feature is a replacement of the ARPANET non-blocking
   host interface, which was never implemented, and will be available to
   hosts using either the 1822 or 1822L Host Access Protocol.  This RFC
   is also being presented as a solicitation of comments on the Short

   ARPANET hosts to use logical names as well as 1822's physical port

   This memo is distributed as an RFC only to make this information
   easily accessible to researchers in the ARPA community.  It does not
   specify an Internet standard.  This RFC defines the standard format
   for interchange of Network News articles among USENET sites.  It
   describes the format for articles themselves, and gives partial
   standards for transmission of news.  The news transmission is not
   entirely standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility to
   the individual hosts to choose transmission hardware and software,
   whether to batch news and so on.

                                 TCP

   This RFC describes implementation strategies to deal with two
   mechanisms in TCP, the window and the acknowledgement.  It also
   presents a particular set of algorithms which have received testing
   in the field, and which appear to work properly with each other.
   With more experience, these algorithms may become part of the formal
   specification, until such time their use is recommended.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-812" href="#section-812">812</a>     Harrenstien  </span> Mar 82     NICNAME/WHOIS

   This RFC gives a description of what the NICNAME/WHOIS Server is and
   how to access it.  This server together with the corresponding
   Identification Data Base provides online directory look-up equivalent
   to the ARPANET Directory.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-811" href="#section-811">811</a>     Harrenstien  </span> Mar 82      Hostnames Server

   This RFC gives a description of what the Hostnames Server is and how
   to access it.  The function of this particular server is to deliver
   machine-readable name/address information describing networks,
   gateways, hosts, and eventually domains, within the internet
   environment.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-810" href="#section-810">810</a>     Feinler  </span>    Mar 82      DoD Internet Host Table Specification

   This RFC specifies a new host table format applicable to both ARPANET
   and Internet needs.  In addition to host name to host address
   translation and selected protocol information, we have also included
   network and gateway name to address correspondence, and host
   operating system information.  This RFC obsoletes the host table
   described in <a href="./rfc608">RFC 608</a>.

   This RFC describes the features of the computerised facsimile system
   developed in the Department of Computer Science at UCL.  First its
   functions are considered and the related experimental work are
   reported.  Then the disciplines for system design are discussed.
   Finally, the implementation of the system are described, while
   detailed description are given as appendices.

                                 Meeting Held at BBN on 10 January 1979

   This RFC is a very belated attempt to document a meeting that was
   held three years earlier to discuss the state of computer mail in the
   ARPA community and to reach some conclusions to guide the further
   development of computer mail systems such that a coherent total mail
   service would continue to be provided.

   This RFC consists of notes from a meeting held at USC Information
   Sciences Institute on the 12th of January to discuss common interests
   in multimedia computer mail issues and to agree on some specific
   initial experiments.

   This RFC deals with Computer Based Message systems which provides a
   basis for interaction between different CBMS by defining the format
   of messages passed between them.  This RFC is replaced by <a href="./rfc841">RFC 841</a>.

   This RFC consists of notes from a meeting that was held at USC
   Information Sciences Institute on 11 January 1982, to discuss
   addressing issues in computer mail. The major conclusion reached at
   the meeting is to extend the "username@hostname" mailbox format to
   "username@host.domain", where the domain itself can be further
   strutured.

   This is the CCITT standard for group 3 facsimile encoding.  This is
   useful for data compression of bit map data.

   The first part of this RFC describes in detail the Dacom 450 data
   compression algorithms and is an update and correction to an earlier
   memorandum.  The second part of this RFC describes briefly the Dacom
   500 data compression algorithm as used by the INTELPOST
   electronic-mail network under development by the US Postal Service
   and several foreign administrators.

   This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host
   access protocol.  The first change will allow hosts to use logical
   addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their
   physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and
   the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of time that it
   may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to the network
   (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to 15
   seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.

   This RFC discusses the conversion of hosts from NCP to TCP.  And
   making available the principle services:  Telnet, File Transfer, and
   Mail.  These protocols allow all hosts in the ARPA community to share
   a common interprocess communication environment.
