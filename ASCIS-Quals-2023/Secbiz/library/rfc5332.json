However, this usage was never\r\ndeployed.  This specification updates RFC 3032 by redefining the\r\nmeaning of these two codepoints.  Both codepoints can now be used to\r\ncarry multicast packets.  The second codepoint (formerly the\r\n\"multicast codepoint\") is now to be used only on multiaccess media,\r\nand it is to mean \"the top label of the following label stack is an\r\nupstream-assigned label\".\r\n\r\nRFC 3032 does not specify the destination address to be placed in the\r\n\"MAC DA\" (Medium Access Layer Destination Address) field of an\r\nethernet frame that carries an MPLS multicast packet.  This document\r\nprovides that specification.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 3032 and RFC 4023.
