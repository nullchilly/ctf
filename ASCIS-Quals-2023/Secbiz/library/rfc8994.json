This Autonomic Control Plane\r\nshould ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of\r\nconfiguration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the\r\n\"Autonomic Control Plane\", with the primary use as a control plane\r\nfor autonomic functions.  It also serves as a \"virtual out-of-band\r\nchannel\" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM)\r\ncommunications over a network that provides automatically configured,\r\nhop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via\r\nautomatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured\r\nor is misconfigured.","pub_date":"May 2021","keywords":["addressing-scheme","ANI","autonomic networking","autonomous operation","BRSKI","certificate","Data-Plane","domain","DTLS","DULL","EST","GRASP","IDevID","inband","IPsec","IPv6","LDevID","loopback-interface","NOC","OAM","out-of-band","registrar","renewal","RPL","secure","self-management","ULA","VPN","VRF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8994","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8994"}
