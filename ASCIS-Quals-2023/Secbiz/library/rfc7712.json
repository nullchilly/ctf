First, it specifies how to\r\nestablish a strong association between a domain name and an XML\r\nstream, using the concept of \"prooftypes\".  Second, it describes how\r\nto securely delegate a service domain name (e.g., example.com) to a\r\ntarget server hostname (e.g., hosting.example.net); this is\r\nespecially important in multi-tenanted environments where the same\r\ntarget server hosts a large number of domains.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["XMPP","Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol","Jabber","federation","delegation","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7712","errata_url":null}
