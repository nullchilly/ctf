These can be used to produce valid protocolDirTable ``INDEX`` encodings, as defined by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information Base) Version 2 [RFC2021] and the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference [RFC2895]. \r\n\r\n This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol identifier macros for well-known protocols.  A conformant implementation of the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] can be accomplished without the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this document does not specify any IETF standard.  It is published to encourage better interoperability between RMON-2 agent implementations, by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol information.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
