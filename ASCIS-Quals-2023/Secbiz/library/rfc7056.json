The Extensible Authentication Protocol GSS-API\r\nmechanism allows an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting\r\n(AAA) peer to provide authorization attributes alongside an\r\nauthentication response.  It also supplies mechanisms to process\r\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) messages provided in the\r\nAAA response.  This document describes how to use the Naming\r\nExtensions API to access that information.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7056","errata_url":null}
