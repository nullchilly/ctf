The two sub-\r\ngroups worked independently, and the resulting requirements represent\r\ntwo separate views of the problem and of what is required to fix the\r\nproblem.  This document may usefully serve as part of the recommended\r\nreading for anyone who works on routing architecture designs for the\r\nInternet in the future.\r\n\r\nThe document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a\r\nrecord of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding\r\nthat it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical\r\nunderstanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the\r\ndate of publication.  This document defines a Historic Document for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["Routing Research Group","RRG","IDR","FDR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5772","errata_url":null}
