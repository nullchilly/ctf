Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text\r\npassword mechanism using \"anonymous\" as the user name and using optional\r\ntrace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As\r\nplain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a\r\nnew way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the\r\nSimple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
