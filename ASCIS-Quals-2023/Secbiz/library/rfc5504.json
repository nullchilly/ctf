The Email Address\r\nInternationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension allows UTF-8 characters in\r\nSMTP envelope and mail header fields.  To avoid rejecting\r\ninternationalized email messages when a server in the delivery path\r\ndoes not support the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting\r\nmechanism is required.  This document describes a downgrading\r\nmechanism for Email Address Internationalization.  Note that this is\r\na way to downgrade, not tunnel.  There is no associated up-conversion\r\nmechanism, although internationalized email clients might use\r\noriginal internationalized addresses or other data when displaying or\r\nreplying to downgraded messages.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["[--------]","EAI","Email Address Internationalization","Downgrade","MAIL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6530"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5504","errata_url":null}
