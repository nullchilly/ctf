Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and\r\nprotocols that a service provider uses in order to offer this service\r\nto customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast traffic in their\r\nVPNs.  It is also desirable to be able to support customers who have\r\nMPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs.  This document specifies the\r\nprocedures and protocol extensions that are needed to support\r\ncustomers who use the Multipoint LDP (mLDP) as the control protocol for their\r\nMPLS multicast\r\ntraffic.  Existing standards do provide some support for customers\r\nwho use mLDP, but only under a restrictive set of circumstances.\r\nThis document generalizes the existing support to include all cases\r\nwhere the customer uses mLDP, without any restrictions.
