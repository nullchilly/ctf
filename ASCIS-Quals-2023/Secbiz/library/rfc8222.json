Moreover, when it\r\nuses DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a\r\nsubset of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where\r\nsome environments use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized\r\nDomain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other environments use\r\nlabels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets\r\ncorresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD\r\nto be used effectively in environments where multiple different name\r\nsystems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is\r\nimportant to attend to differences in the underlying technology and\r\noperational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the\r\nrequirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and\r\nother resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in\r\nthis manner.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["DNS","mDNS","DNS-SD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8222","errata_url":null}
