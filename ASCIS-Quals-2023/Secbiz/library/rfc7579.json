In some of these technologies, network\r\nelements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as\r\nasymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and\r\nlabel range limitations on links.\r\n\r\nThis document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for\r\ngeneral information elements representing connectivity and label\r\nconstraints as well as label availability.  It is intended that\r\nprotocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how\r\ninformation is carried for specific uses.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["WSON","Optical Network Control","Protocol-agnostic encoding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7579","errata_url":null}
