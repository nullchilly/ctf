The\r\nauto-discovery mechanism for L1VPNs allows the provider network\r\ndevices to dynamically discover the set of Provider Edges (PEs) having\r\nports attached to Customer Edge (CE) members of the same VPN.  That\r\ninformation is necessary for completing the signaling phase of L1VPN\r\nconnections.  One main objective of a L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism is\r\nto support the \"single-end provisioning\" model, where addition of a\r\nnew port to a given L1VPN would involve configuration changes only on\r\nthe PE that has this port and on the CE that is connected to the PE\r\nvia this port.
