It\r\nfacilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given\r\nresource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime\r\nnegotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the\r\ngiven resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps\r\nare lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior\r\nstates of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates\r\nrecognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of\r\nanother resource.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":["HTTP","content negotiation","datetime negotiation","resource versions","archival resources","Memento"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7089","errata_url":null}
