RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these\r\nparameters be statically configured.  Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping work\r\naims to make this information dynamically available to the mobile\r\nnode.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution\r\nis to support interworking with existing Authentication,\r\nAuthorization, and Accounting (AAA) infrastructures.  This document\r\ndescribes MIPv6 bootstrapping using the Diameter Network Access\r\nServer to home AAA server interface.
