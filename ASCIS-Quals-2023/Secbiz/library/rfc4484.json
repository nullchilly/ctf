While some\r\nauthentication mechanisms are described in the base SIP\r\nspecification, trait-based authorization provides information used to\r\nmake policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant in a\r\nsession.  This approach provides a richer framework for\r\nauthorization, as well as allows greater privacy for users of an\r\nidentity system.
