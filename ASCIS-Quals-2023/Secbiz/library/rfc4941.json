Krishnan"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"23","pub_status":"DRAFT STANDARD","status":"DRAFT STANDARD","source":"IP Version 6 Working Group","abstract":"Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate\r\naddresses using a combination of locally available information and\r\ninformation advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining\r\nnetwork prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that\r\ncontains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is\r\ntypically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface\r\nidentifier is generated through other means, for example, via random\r\nnumber generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6\r\nstateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface\r\nidentifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension\r\ncauses nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface\r\nidentifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface\r\ncontains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface\r\nidentifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over\r\ntime makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information\r\ncollectors to identify when different addresses used in different\r\ntransactions actually correspond to the same node.
