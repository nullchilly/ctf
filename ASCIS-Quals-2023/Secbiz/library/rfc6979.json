Such signatures are compatible with standard Digital\r\nSignature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature\r\nAlgorithm (ECDSA) digital signatures and can be processed with\r\nunmodified verifiers, which need not be aware of the procedure\r\ndescribed therein.  Deterministic signatures retain the cryptographic\r\nsecurity features associated with digital signatures but can be more\r\neasily implemented in various environments, since they do not need\r\naccess to a source of high-quality randomness.","pub_date":"August 2013","keywords":["dsa","ecdsa","digital signature","deterministic"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6979","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6979"}
