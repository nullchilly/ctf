When supported over the Internet Protocol suite,\r\nthis may be facilitated through a network-layer admission control\r\nsolution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g.,\r\nbandwidth).  These resources may be explicitly set aside for\r\nprioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions.  This\r\ndocument specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol\r\n(RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority\r\ncapability at the network layer.\r\n\r\nBased on current security concerns, these extensions are intended for\r\nuse in a single administrative domain.
