      Proxy ARP/ND function augmented by the capability of the ARP/ND
      Extended Community. From that perspective, this document updates the EVPN
      specification to provide more comprehensive documentation of the
      operation of the Proxy ARP/ND function. The EVPN Proxy ARP/ND function
      and the ARP/ND Extended Community help operators of Internet Exchange
      Points, Data Centers, and other networks deal with IPv4 and IPv6 address
      resolution issues associated with large Broadcast Domains by reducing

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">As specified in <xref target="RFC7432" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7432"/>, the IP
      Address field in the Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) Media
      Access Control (MAC) / IP Advertisement route may optionally carry one
      of the IP addresses associated with the MAC address. A Provider Edge (PE) may learn
      local IP-&gt;MAC pairs and advertise them in EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
      routes. Remote PEs importing those routes in the same Broadcast Domain
      (BD) may add those IP-&gt;MAC pairs to their Proxy ARP/ND tables and
      reply to local ARP Requests or Neighbor Solicitations (or
      "unicast-forward" those packets to the owner MAC), reducing and even
      suppressing, in some cases, the flooding in the EVPN network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">EVPN and its associated Proxy ARP/ND function are extremely useful in
      Data Centers (DCs) or Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) with large Broadcast Domains,
      where the amount of ARP/ND flooded traffic causes issues on connected
      routers and Customer Edges (CEs). <xref target="RFC6820" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6820"/> describes the address
      resolution problems in large DC networks.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document describes the Proxy ARP/ND function in <xref target="RFC7432" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7432"/> networks, augmented by the
      capability of the ARP/ND Extended Community <xref target="RFC9047" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9047"/>. From that perspective, this document updates <xref target="RFC7432" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7432"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">Proxy ARP/ND may be implemented to help IXPs, DCs, and other operators

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-1">As described in <xref target="RFC6820" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6820"/>, the IPv4
        and IPv6 address resolution can create a lot of issues in large
        DCs. In particular, the issues created by IPv4 Address
        Resolution Protocol procedures may be significant.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">On one hand, ARP Requests use broadcast MAC addresses; therefore,
        any Tenant System in a large Broadcast Domain will see a large amount
        of ARP traffic, which is not addressed to most of the receivers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-3">On the other hand, the flooding issue becomes even worse if some
        Tenant Systems disappear from the Broadcast Domain, since some
        implementations will persistently retry sending ARP Requests. As <xref target="RFC6820" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6820"/> states, there are no clear
        requirements for retransmitting ARP Requests in the absence of
        replies; hence, an implementation may choose to keep retrying endlessly

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-1">The implementation described in this document is especially useful
        in IXP networks.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-2">A typical IXP provides access to a large Layer 2 Broadcast Domain
        for peering purposes (referred to as "the peering network"), where
        (hundreds of) Internet routers are connected. We refer to these
        Internet routers as CE devices in this section.
        Because of the requirement to connect all routers to a single Layer 2
        network, the peering networks use IPv4 addresses in length ranges from
        /21 to /24 (and even bigger for IPv6), which can create very large
        Broadcast Domains.

	This peering network is transparent to the CEs and
        therefore floods any ARP Requests or NS messages to all the CEs in the
        network. Gratuitous ARP and NA messages are flooded to all the CEs
        too.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-3">In these IXP networks, most of the CEs are typically peering
        routers and roughly all the Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast
        (BUM) traffic is originated by the ARP and ND address resolution
        procedures. This ARP/ND BUM traffic causes significant data volumes
        that reach every single router in the peering network. Since the
        ARP/ND messages are processed in "slow path" software processors and
        they take high priority in the routers, heavy loads of ARP/ND traffic
        can cause some routers to run out of resources. CEs disappearing from
        the network may cause address resolution explosions that can make a
        router with limited processing power fail to keep BGP sessions
        running.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-4">The issue might be better in IPv6 routers if Multicast Listener
        Discovery (MLD) snooping was enabled, since ND uses an SN-multicast
        address in NS messages; however, ARP uses broadcast and has to be
        processed by all the routers in the network. Some routers may also be
        configured to broadcast periodic Gratuitous ARPs (GARPs) <xref target="RFC5227" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5227"/>. For IPv6, the fact that IPv6 CEs
        have more than one IPv6 address contributes to the growth of ND
        flooding in the network. The amount of ARP/ND flooded traffic grows
        linearly with the number of IXP participants; therefore, the issue can
        only grow worse as new CEs are added.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-5">In order to deal with this issue, IXPs have developed certain
        solutions over the past years. While these solutions may mitigate the
        issues of address resolution in large Broadcast Domains, EVPN
        provides new more efficient possibilities to IXPs. EVPN and its
        Proxy ARP/ND function may help solve the issue in a distributed and
        scalable way, fully integrated with the PE network.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-1">Some IXPs and other operators want to protect particular hosts on
        the BD while allowing dynamic learning of CE addresses. For example,
        an operator may want to configure static IP-&gt;MAC entries for
        management and infrastructure hosts that provide critical services. In
        this scenario, static entries are provisioned from the management
        plane for protected IP-&gt;MAC addresses, and dynamic learning with
        Proxy ARP/ND is enabled as described in <xref target="sect-6.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.2"/> on
        the BD.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.3-2">This scenario makes use of the same sub-functions as in <xref target="sect-6.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.2"/> but with static entries added by

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.4-1">For a solution that maximizes security and eliminates flooding and
        unknown unicast in the peering network, all IP-&gt;MAC entries are
        provisioned from the management plane. The Proxy ARP/ND function is
        enabled in the BDs of the EVPN PEs so that the PEs intercept and
        respond to CE requests.
	Dynamic learning and ARP/ND snooping is
        disabled so that ARP Requests and NS messages to unknown IPs are discarded at
        the ingress PE. This scenario provides an operator the most control
        over IP-&gt;MAC entries and allows an operator to manage all entries
        from a management system.</t>

        entries, the Maintenance sub-function will not require any procedures

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-1">Nowadays, almost all IXPs install some security rules in order to
        protect the peering network (BD). These rules are often called port
        security. Port security summarizes different operational steps that
        limit the access to the IXP-LAN and the customer router and controls
        the kind of traffic that the routers are allowed to exchange (e.g.,
        Ethernet, IPv4, and IPv6). Due to this, the deployment scenario as
        described in <xref target="sect-6.4" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.4"/>, "All Static
        Provisioning with Proxy ARP/ND", is the predominant scenario for
        IXPs.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-2">In addition to the "All Static Provisioning" behavior, in IXP
        networks it is recommended to configure the Reply sub-function to
        "discard" ARP Requests / NS messages with unrecognized options.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-3">At IXPs, customers usually follow a certain operational life cycle.

            blocked. Pre-defined IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the IXP peering
            network space are configured at the customer router. The

          anycast addresses, the "anycast" capability will be explicitly
          enabled in the Proxy ND function and hence the Proxy ND sub-functions
          modified accordingly. For instance, if IPv6 "anycast" is enabled in
          the Proxy ND function, the duplicate IP detection procedure in <xref target="sect-4.6" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.7"/> must be disabled.</li>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">The security considerations of <xref target="RFC7432" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7432"/> and <xref target="RFC9047" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9047"/> apply to this document too. Note that EVPN does not
      inherently provide cryptographic protection (including confidentiality
      protection).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-2">The procedures in this document reduce the amount of ARP/ND message
      flooding, which in itself provides a protection to "slow path" software
      processors of routers and Tenant Systems in large BDs. The ARP/ND
      requests that are replied to by the Proxy ARP/ND function (hence not
      flooded) are normally targeted to existing hosts in the BD. ARP/ND
      requests targeted to absent hosts are still normally flooded; however,
      the suppression of unknown ARP Requests and NS messages described in
      <xref target="sect-4.5" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.6"/> can provide an additional
      level of security against ARP Requests / NS messages issued to
      non-existing hosts.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-3">While the unicast-forward and/or flood suppression sub-functions
      provide an added security mechanism for the BD, they can also increase
      the risk of blocking the service for a CE if the EVPN PEs cannot provide
      the ARP/ND resolution that the CE needs.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-4">The solution also provides protection against Denial-of-Service (DoS)
      attacks that use ARP/ND spoofing as a first step. The duplicate IP
      detection and the use of an AS-MAC as explained in <xref target="sect-4.6" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.7"/> protects the BD against ARP/ND
      spoofing.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-5">The Proxy ARP/ND function specified in this document does not allow
      for the learning of an IP address mapped to multiple MAC addresses in
      the same table unless the "anycast" capability is enabled (and only in
      case of Proxy ND). When "anycast" is enabled in the Proxy ND function,
      the number of allowed entries for the same IP address
      <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be limited by the operator to prevent DoS attacks
      that attempt to fill the Proxy ND table with a significant number of
      entries for the same IP.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-6">This document provides some examples and guidelines that can be used
      by IXPs in their EVPN BDs. When EVPN and its associated Proxy ARP/ND
      function are used in IXP networks, they provide ARP/ND security and
      mitigation. IXPs must still employ additional security mechanisms that
      protect the peering network as per the established BCPs such as the ones
      described in <xref target="EURO-IX-BCP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EURO-IX-BCP"/>. For example,
      IXPs should disable all unneeded control protocols and block unwanted
      protocols from CEs so that only IPv4, ARP, and IPv6 Ethertypes are
      permitted on the peering network. In addition, port security features
      and ACLs can provide an additional level of security.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-7">Finally, it is worth noting that the Proxy ARP/ND solution in this
      document will not work if there is a mechanism securing ARP/ND exchanges
      among CEs because the PE is not able to secure the "proxied" ND
      messages.</t>

The autoconfiguration process includes generating a link-local address, generating global addresses via stateless address autoconfiguration, and the Duplicate Address Detection procedure to verify the uniqueness of the addresses on a link.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The document describes a proxy-based mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to-multipoint architecture with a "split-horizon" forwarding scheme, primarily deployed for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fiber access architectures.  Based on the DAD signaling, the first-hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point-to-multipoint domain (e.g., VLAN).  When a node performs DAD for an address already used by another node, the first-hop router defends the address rather than the device using the address.</t>
