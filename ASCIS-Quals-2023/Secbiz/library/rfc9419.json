RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or\r\nfrom on-path elements and points out that visible information will be\r\nused whether or not it is intended as a signal. The principles in\r\nthis document are intended as guidance for the design of explicit\r\npath signals, which are encouraged to be authenticated and include a\r\nminimal set of parties to minimize information sharing. These\r\nprinciples can be achieved through mechanisms like encryption of\r\ninformation and establishing trust relationships between entities on\r\na path.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9419","errata_url":null}
