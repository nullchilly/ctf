This implies that application\r\nprogramming logic can seamlessly gain access to appropriate resources\r\nthat are not co-located on the same physical network entity.  The\r\nframework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an\r\napplication-level control mechanism between application servers and\r\nassociated external servers such as media servers.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the creation of this framework is to provide an\r\ninterface suitable to meet the requirements of a centralized\r\nconference system, where the conference system can be distributed, as\r\ndefined by the XCON working group in the IETF.  It is not, however,\r\nlimited to this scope.
