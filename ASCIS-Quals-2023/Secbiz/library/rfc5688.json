Amongst those capabilities are the\r\ntype of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME\r\ntypes.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range\r\nof stream types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a\r\ncapability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which\r\napplication subtypes the agent supports.
