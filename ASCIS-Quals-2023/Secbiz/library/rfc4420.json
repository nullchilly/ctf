This protocol includes an object\r\n(the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object) that carries a Flags field used to\r\nindicate options and attributes of the LSP.  That Flags field has\r\neight bits allowing for eight options to be set.  Recent proposals in\r\nmany documents that extend RSVP-TE have suggested uses for each of\r\nthe previously unused bits.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a new object for RSVP-TE messages that allows\r\nthe signaling of further attribute bits and also the carriage of\r\narbitrary attribute parameters to make RSVP-TE easily extensible to\r\nsupport new requirements.  Additionally, this document defines a way\r\nto record the attributes applied to the LSP on a hop-by-hop basis.\r\n\r\nThe object mechanisms defined in this document are equally applicable\r\nto Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Packet Switch Capable (PSC) LSPs and to\r\nGMPLS non-PSC LSPs.
