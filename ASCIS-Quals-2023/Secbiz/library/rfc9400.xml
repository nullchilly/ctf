      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the IETF to convert all its plenary meetings
to online-only events. This document records the experience gained by holding
plenary meetings fully online and proposes guidelines based on this experience.
In general, participant surveys indicated satisfaction with the organization of
these meetings.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Although these guidelines reflect lessons learned in 2020 and 2021, the IETF is
encouraged to continue to experiment with the format and agenda of fully online
meetings, using this document as a baseline.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Hybrid meetings (meaning meetings that have large remote participation but also
onsite participation) are out of scope. However, some of the experience gained
from fully online meetings might also provide input for decisions regarding the
organization of hybrid meetings.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic
in March 2020, the IETF canceled its
plenary meeting and organized an online replacement in less than 2 weeks. For
this first online-only meeting, the agenda was reduced to a set of sessions that
benefited most from cross-area participation, like BoFs, first-time meetings of
new working groups, and dispatch sessions. It also included the administrative
plenary to preserve the official handover procedures that occur at March IETF
meetings, as described in <xref target="RFC8713" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8713"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">With a reduced agenda, the meeting format was two sessions (about 4 hours) per day
with a maximum of two parallel tracks. Other working group meetings were
scheduled as interims over the following 6 weeks. The IESG published a
purely advisory recommended schedule <xref target="INTERIM-SCHEDULE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="INTERIM-SCHEDULE"/> to reduce conflicts
among those interims.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">While satisfaction was high right after the meeting <xref target="IETF107-FEEDBACK" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IETF107-FEEDBACK"/>, some participants
later indicated in mailing list discussions that the period of intensive interims had a
greater impact on their calendar than a single plenary meeting week, and in some
meetings participation was reduced. Those interims tended to occur at times convenient for the bulk
of participants, which was convenient for most but could exclude those in less
common time zones.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">For the remainder of 2020 and 2021, the online schedule was switched back to be
similar to an in-person meeting (1- to 2-hour slots and eight or nine parallel tracks).
However, each day was limited to 5-6 hours in recognition that remote
participation is more tiring.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">All fully online meetings followed the time zone of the planned in-person
meeting location. As a 6-hour agenda has some flexibility regarding the start
time while still fitting within a previously used 8-hour in-person agenda, the start
time was approximately noon, with adjustments of an hour or so to mitigate the
impact of early morning hours in time zones with many participants. As selection
of in-person meeting sites was consistent with the 1-1-1 guideline as documented
in <xref target="RFC8719" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8719"/>, this approach was intended to share the burden across all common
geographies roughly equally.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-1">The following algorithm was not used in 2020 or 2021, but it enables most
participants to avoid late-night sessions in two out of every three fully online IETF
plenary meetings. Basically, every fully online meeting is for two regions of the
three regions described in <xref target="RFC8719" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8719"/>, with one being roughly after sunrise
and the other around sundown. This has the trade-off that the third region is in
the middle of night.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-2">The times are also seasonally adjusted to leverage differentials in Daylight
Saving Time. These time slots are as follows, in UTC, based on the Daylight

so that no attendee has to be

optimal for their schedule. However, as participation is distributed globally,
it needs to be acknowledged that restricting the scheme to three regions
observes the intent of <xref target="RFC8719" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8719"/> but does not achieve the
goal of two non-late-night sessions for all participants equally.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-1">By 2021, fully online meetings were consistently held over 5 days with roughly 6-hour
meeting days. The day with the administrative plenary, which concludes with
multiple open mic sessions, sometimes exceeded this limit.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-2">Six hours of online meetings, with two 30-minute breaks, was a compromise
between the physical limits of attending an online meeting in an inconvenient
time zone and the demand for many sessions with a manageable number of
conflicts. The IETF 109 feedback <xref target="IETF109-SURVEY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IETF109-SURVEY"/> indicated broad satisfaction
with a 5-day meeting but only medium satisfaction with the overall length of
each day.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-3">The IETF did not seriously consider extending sessions into the weekend before
or after the main meeting week, although at IETF 108 and subsequent meetings the Hackathon occupied the entire week before (see <xref target="RFC9311" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9311"/>).</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-1">For fully online meetings, there are typically fewer sessions per day than for
in-person meetings, to keep the overall meeting day to roughly 6 hours.
With fewer sessions, chairs were offered only two options for session length
(instead of three).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">IETF 108, based on an indicated preference of the community, scheduled 50- and
100-minute slots, with 10-minute breaks, in order to keep the overall day length
at 5 hours. This resulted in many sessions going over time, which indicated that
10 minutes for breaks is not practical.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-3">The survey after IETF 109 <xref target="IETF109-SURVEY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IETF109-SURVEY"/> showed high satisfaction with 60/120-minute
session lengths and 30-minute breaks, and a significant improvement in
satisfaction over IETF 108.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-4">The longer breaks, while extending the day, provided adequate time for meals,
exercise, and "hallway" conversations using online tools.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-1">In-person meetings are limited in the number of parallel tracks by the number of
meeting rooms, but online meetings are not. However, more parallel tracks
would increase the number of possible agenda conflicts.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-2">If the total number of requested sessions exceeds the capacity of the usual eight
parallel tracks, it is possible for a fully online meeting to simply use more
tracks. If the number and length of meeting days are seen as fixed, this decision
is implicitly made by the working group chairs requesting a certain number of
sessions and length.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4-3">IETF 111 used nine parallel tracks for some of the sessions and experienced
slightly more conflicts in the agenda-scheduling process, though there was no
statistically significant increase in dissatisfaction about conflicts in the
survey <xref target="IETF111-SURVEY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IETF111-SURVEY"/>.</t>

meeting (full meeting) compared to that of IETF 107, which hosted only a limited
set of sessions followed by interims in the weeks after. The structure of IETF
108 was preferred by 82%. Respondents valued cross-participation and an
intensive meeting week for maintaining project momentum.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">Furthermore, a well-defined meeting time, rather than spreading many interims
over the whole year, can make deconflicting with other non-IETF meetings easier.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-3">However, interim meetings can also help to reduce scheduling conflicts during an
IETF week and allow for a more optimal time slot for the key participants. While
interim meetings are less likely to attract people with casual interest, they
provide a good opportunity for the most active participants of a group to have
detailed technical discussions and solve recorded issues efficiently.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-2">An in-person meeting must fit all sessions into an acceptable length for
international travel (usually roughly a week), but online meetings do not have
that constraint.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-3">Therefore, it would be possible to keep most regular working group sessions
within the usual 5 main meeting days but have some of the more conflicted
sessions in other dedicated time slots. As the Hackathon for fully online
meetings is usually held in the week before the online plenary meeting
<xref target="RFC9311" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9311"/>, that week is already a highly active week for many IETF
participants and might provide an opportunity to schedule a few selected
sessions.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-4">This might work especially well for sessions that are of high interest to a
large part of the community, such as BoFs and dispatch meetings, and therefore hard
to schedule during the main IETF week.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-5">At IETF 112, the IESG ran an experiment where the administrative plenary was
scheduled on the Wednesday before the official session week. The experiment
report <xref target="IETF112-EXPERIMENT" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IETF112-EXPERIMENT"/> found that it led to a reduction in scheduling
conflicts but also a slight drop in attendance of the administrative plenary, partly
due to insufficient awareness.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-1">Participation in the fully online meetings in 2021 was high and had a stable
per-country distribution, even though time zones were rotated. This indicates
that online meetings support a more consistent geographic distribution of
participants than in-person meetings, where participation often fluctuates based
on the location.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-2">However, online meetings do not provide an equivalent opportunity to socialize.
Despite significant investment in tools to foster hallway conversations, many
did not use those tools, whether due to ignorance of them, dislike of the tools,
or a preference for other activities at home (including sleep and food)
over hallway interactions.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-3">There was a decrease in submissions of new (-00) Internet-Drafts during 2020 and
2021, although the overall number of draft submissions remained stable;
this decrease in new submissions might have resulted from the loss of these interactions. Informal conversations might
be important to inspire new work.</t>
