OWAMP can be used bi-directionally to measure one-way\r\nmetrics in both directions between two network elements.  However,\r\nit does not accommodate round-trip or two-way measurements.  This\r\nmemo specifies a Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), based\r\non the OWAMP, that adds two-way or round-trip measurement\r\ncapabilities.  The TWAMP measurement architecture is usually\r\ncomprised of two hosts with specific roles, and this allows for\r\nsome protocol simplifications, making it an attractive alternative\r\nin some circumstances.
