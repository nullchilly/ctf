An approach for using CoAP on top of IP\r\nmulticast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality as well as\r\nnew features introduced in this specification.  Also, various use\r\ncases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate\r\nimportant concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in\r\nvarious network topologies.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["multicast","IP multicast","RESTful","Internet of Things (IoT)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7390","errata_url":null}
