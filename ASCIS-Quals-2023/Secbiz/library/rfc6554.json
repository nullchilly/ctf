In some\r\nconfigurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained\r\nrouters to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing\r\nProtocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some\r\ndeployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the\r\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the\r\nIPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing\r\ntables on memory-constrained routers.  This document specifies a new\r\nIPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL\r\nrouting domain.
