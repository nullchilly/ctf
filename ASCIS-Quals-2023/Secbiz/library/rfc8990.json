GRASP depends on\r\nan external security environment that is described elsewhere. The\r\ntechnical objectives and parameters for specific application\r\nscenarios are to be described in separate documents. Appendices\r\nbriefly discuss requirements for the protocol and existing protocols\r\nwith comparable features.","pub_date":"May 2021","keywords":["autonomic networking","autonomous operation","self-management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8990","errata_url":null}
