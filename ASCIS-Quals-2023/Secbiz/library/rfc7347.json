At the time of publication,\r\nthese pre-standard implementations were still in operation carrying\r\nlive traffic.\r\n\r\nThe specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional\/bidirectional\r\nprotection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching.  It\r\nis purely supported by the MPLS-TP data plane and can work without\r\nany control plane.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7347","errata_url":null}
