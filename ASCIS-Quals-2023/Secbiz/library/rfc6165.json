While supporting this\r\nconcept involves several pieces, this document only describes\r\nextensions to IS-IS.  Furthermore, the Type, Length, Value pairs\r\n(TLVs) described in this document are generic Layer-2 additions, and\r\nspecific ones as needed are defined in the IS-IS technology-specific\r\nextensions.  We leave it to the systems using these IS-IS extensions\r\nto explain how the information carried in IS-IS is used.
