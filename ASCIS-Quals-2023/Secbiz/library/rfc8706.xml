      <t pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
      to its neighbors that it is restarting, allowing them to reestablish
      their adjacencies without cycling through the DOWN state while still
      correctly initiating database synchronization.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-2">This document additionally describes a mechanism for a router to
      signal its neighbors that it is preparing to initiate a restart while
      maintaining forwarding-plane state. This allows the neighbors to
      maintain their adjacencies until the router has restarted but also
      allows the neighbors
      to bring the adjacencies down in the event of other
      topology changes.</t>

      router to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data Unit

      <t pn="section-1-1">The Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing
      protocol <xref target="RFC1195" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1195"/> <xref target="ISO10589" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ISO10589"/> is a link state intra-domain routing
      protocol. Normally, when an IS-IS router is restarted, temporary
      disruption of routing occurs due to events in both the restarting router
      and the neighbors of the restarting router.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">The router that has been restarted computes its own routes before
      achieving database synchronization with its neighbors. The results of
      this computation are likely to be non-convergent with the routes
      computed by other routers in the area/domain.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">Neighbors of the restarting router detect the restart event and cycle
      their adjacencies with the restarting router through the DOWN state. The
      cycling of the adjacency state causes the neighbors to regenerate their
      LSPs describing the adjacency concerned. This in turn causes a temporary
      disruption of routes passing through the restarting router.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">In certain scenarios, the temporary disruption of the routes is
      highly undesirable. This document describes mechanisms to avoid or
      minimize the disruption due to both of these causes.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">When an adjacency is reinitialized as a result of a neighbor
      restarting, a router does three things:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1" start="1" pn="section-1-6">
        <li pn="section-1-6.1" derivedCounter="1.">It causes its own LSP(s) to be regenerated, thus triggering
	Shortest Path First (SPF)
          runs throughout the area (or in the case of Level 2, throughout the
          domain).</li>
        <li pn="section-1-6.2" derivedCounter="2.">It sets SRMflags on its own LSP database on the adjacency
          concerned.</li>
        <li pn="section-1-6.3" derivedCounter="3.">In the case of a Point-to-Point link, it transmits a complete set
          of Complete Sequence Number PDUs (CSNPs), over the adjacency.</li>
      </ol>
      <t pn="section-1-7">In the case of a restarting router process, the first of these is
      highly undesirable, but the second is essential in order to ensure
      synchronization of the LSP database.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-8">The third action above minimizes the number of LSPs that must be
      exchanged and, if made reliable, provides a means of determining when
      the LSP databases of the neighboring routers have been synchronized.
      This is desirable whether or not the router is being restarted (so that
      the overload bit can be cleared in the router's own LSP, for
      example).</t>
      <t pn="section-1-9">This document describes a mechanism for a restarting router to signal
      to its neighbors that it is restarting. The mechanism further allows the
      neighbors to reestablish their adjacencies with the restarting router
      without cycling through the DOWN state while still correctly initiating
      database synchronization.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-10">This document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting
      router to determine when it has achieved LSP database synchronization
      with its neighbors and a mechanism to optimize LSP database
      synchronization and minimize transient routing disruption when a router
      starts.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-11">It is assumed that the three-way handshake <xref target="RFC5303" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5303"/>
      is being used on Point-to-Point circuits.</t>

      <t pn="section-2-1">If the control and forwarding functions in a router can be maintained
      independently, it is possible for the forwarding function state to be
      maintained across a resumption of control function operations. This
      functionality is assumed when the terms "restart/restarting" are used in
      this document.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">The terms "start/starting" are used to refer to a router in which the
      control function has either commenced operations for the first time or
      has resumed operations, but the forwarding functions have not been
      maintained in a prior state.</t>

        <t pn="section-3.1-4">An instance of the timer T2 is maintained for each LSP database
        (LSPDB) present in the system. For example, for a Level 1/2 system,

        for Level 2. This is the maximum time that the system will wait for

            level's T2 timer has expired and its SPF has been run. This
            ensures that any inter-level information that is to be propagated
            can be included in the Level-n LSP(s).</t>
            <t pn="section-3.4.1.1-4">During this period, if one of the router's own (including
            pseudonodes) LSPs is received, which the local router does not
            currently have in its own database, it is NOT purged. Under normal
            operation, such an LSP would be purged, since the LSP clearly
            should not be present in the global LSP database. However, in the
            present circumstances, this would be highly undesirable, because
            it could cause premature removal of a router's own LSP -- and
            hence churn in remote routers. Even if the local system has one or
            more of the router's own LSPs (which it has generated but not yet
            transmitted), it is still not valid to compare the received LSP
            against this set, since it may be that as a result of propagation
            between Level 1 and Level 2 (or vice versa), a further router's
            own LSP will need to be generated when the LSP databases have
            synchronized.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.4.1.1-5">During this period, a restarting router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send CSNPs as it
            normally would. Information about the router's own LSPs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be
            included, but if it is included, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be based on LSPs that have
            been received, not on versions that have been generated (but not
            yet transmitted). This restriction is necessary to prevent
            premature removal of an LSP from the global LSP database.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.4.1.1-6">When the timer T2 expires or is canceled, indicating that
            synchronization for that level is complete, the SPF for that level
            is run in order to derive any information that is required to be
            propagated to another level, but the forwarding tables are not yet
            updated.</t>

            but that are not part of the current set of own LSPs (including
            pseudonodes), <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> then be purged. Note that it is possible that a
            Designated Router change may have taken place and, consequently,
            the router <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> purge those pseudonode LSPs that it previously
            owned but that are now no longer part of its set of pseudonode

            <t pn="section-3.4.1.1-9">If the timer T3 expires before all the T2 timers have expired
            or been canceled, this indicates that the synchronization process
            is taking longer than the minimum Holding Time of the neighbors.
            The router's own LSP(s) for levels that have not yet completed
            their first SPF computation are then flooded with the overload bit
            set to indicate that the router's LSPDB is not yet synchronized
            (and therefore other routers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> compute routes through this
            router). Normal operation of the update process resumes, and the
            local forwarding tables are updated. In order to prevent the
            neighbor's adjacencies from expiring, IIHs with the normal
            interface value for the Holding Time are transmitted over all
            interfaces with neither RR nor RA set in the Restart TLV. This
            will cause the neighbors to refresh their adjacencies. The
            router's own LSP(s) will continue to have the overload bit set
            until timer T2 has expired or been canceled.</t>

      depend upon the ability of an attacker to inject a false but apparently
      valid IIH, the ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-2">If the RR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such an
      IIH will continue to maintain an existing adjacency in the UP state
      and may (re)send a complete set of CSNPs. While the latter action is
      wasteful, neither action causes any disruption in correct protocol
      operation.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-3">If the RA bit is set in a false IIH, a (re)starting router that
      receives such an IIH may falsely believe that there is a neighbor on the
      corresponding interface that supports the procedures described in this
      document. In the absence of receipt of a complete set of CSNPs on that
      interface, this could delay the completion of (re)start procedures by
      requiring the timer T1 to time out the locally defined maximum number of
      retries. This behavior is the same as would occur on a LAN where none of
      the (re)starting router's neighbors support the procedures in this
      document and is covered in Sections <xref target="adjacencyreacqsection" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.3.1"/> and <xref target="adjacencyacqsection" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.3.2"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-4">If the SA bit is set in a false IIH, this could cause suppression of
      the advertisement of an IS neighbor, which could either continue for an
      indefinite period or occur intermittently with the result being a
      possible loss of reachability to some destinations in the network and/or
      increased frequency of LSP flooding and SPF calculation.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-5">If the PR bit is set in a false IIH, neighbors who receive such an
      IIH could modify the Holding Time of an existing adjacency
      inappropriately. In the event of topology changes, the neighbor might
      also choose to not flood the topology updates and/or bring the adjacency
      down in the false belief that the forwarding plane of the router
      identified as the source of the false IIH is not currently processing
      announced topology changes. This would result in unnecessary forwarding
      disruption.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-6">If the PA bit is set in a false IIH, a router that receives such an
      IIH may falsely believe that the neighbor on the corresponding interface
      supports the planned restart procedures defined in this document. If
      such a router is planning to restart, it might then proceed to initiate a
      restart in the false expectation that the neighbor has updated its
      Holding Time as requested. This may result in the neighbor bringing down
      the adjacency while the receiving router is restarting, causing
      unnecessary disruption to forwarding.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate System, ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols at the link layer for point-to-point links.  As a result, it does not use a three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point media. This paper defines a backward-compatible extension to the protocol that provides for a three-way handshake.  It is fully interoperable with systems that do not support the extension.</t>
            <t>Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than 256 point-to-point links on a single router.</t>
            <t>This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; this paper is provided to the Internet community in order to allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t>This document describes the authentication of Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Protocol Data Units (PDUs) using the Hashed Message Authentication Codes - Message Digest 5 (HMAC-MD5) algorithm as found in RFC 2104.  IS-IS is specified in International Standards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base specification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for multiple authentication algorithms.  The base specification only specifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords.  This document replaces RFC 3567.</t>

            <t>RFC 2119 specifies common key words that may be used in protocol  specifications.  This document aims to reduce the ambiguity by clarifying that only UPPERCASE usage of the key words have the  defined special meanings.</t>

      <t pn="section-appendix.a-1">This document extends RFC 5306 by introducing support for signaling
      the neighbors of a restarting router that a planned restart is about to
      occur. This allows the neighbors to be aware of the state of the
      restarting router so that appropriate action may be taken if other
      topology changes occur while the planned restart is in progress. Since
      the forwarding plane of the restarting router is maintained based upon
      the pre-restart state of the network, additional topology changes
      introduce the possibility that traffic may be lost if paths via the
      restarting router continue to be used while the restart is in
      progress.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-2">In support of this new functionality, two new flags have been
      introduced:</t>

        <dd pn="section-appendix.a-3.4">Planned restart acknowledgement</dd>
      </dl>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-4">No changes to the post-restart exchange between the restarting router
      and its neighbors have been introduced.</t>
