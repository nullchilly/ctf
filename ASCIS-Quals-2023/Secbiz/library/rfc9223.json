Therefore, it can be run over UDP\/IP, including multicast\r\nIP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying\r\nprotocol layer, e.g., to provide security, it can leverage IP\r\nsecurity protocols such as IPsec.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used\r\nby a variety of services for delivery of Application Objects by\r\nspecifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g., by adding or\r\nconstraining some features).\r\n\r\nThis is not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["Multicast","Broadcast","FEC","DASH","HLS","FLUTE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9223","errata_url":null}
