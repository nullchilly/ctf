The protocol can be used as a basis\r\nfor a number of secure network services.  It provides strong\r\nencryption, server authentication, and integrity protection.  It may\r\nalso provide compression.\r\n\r\nKey exchange method, public key algorithm, symmetric encryption\r\nalgorithm, message authentication algorithm, and hash algorithm are\r\nall negotiated.\r\n\r\nThis document also describes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method\r\nand the minimal set of algorithms that are needed to implement the\r\nSSH transport layer protocol.
