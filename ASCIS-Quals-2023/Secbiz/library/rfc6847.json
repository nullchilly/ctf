While these two protocols are seemingly unrelated, they \r\nhave a very similar behavior in the forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over Ethernet, modifying the packet's Media\r\nAccess Control (MAC) addresses at each hop.  This document describes\r\nan architecture for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is \r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":["FCoE","FCRB","TRILL","RBridge"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6847","errata_url":null}
