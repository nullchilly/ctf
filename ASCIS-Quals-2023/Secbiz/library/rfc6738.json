IKEv2 supports\r\nseveral different authentication mechanisms, such as the Extensible\r\nAuthentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and Shared Key (SK).\r\n\r\nDiameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent (HA), as\r\na Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified.\r\nHowever, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not\r\ninclude support for SK-based authentication available with IKEv2.\r\nThis document specifies the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-server\r\ncommunication when the IKEv2 peer authenticates using IKEv2 with SK.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2012","keywords":["[--------]","Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6738","errata_url":null}
