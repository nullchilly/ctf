This protocol provides Remote Direct Memory Access\r\n(RDMA) communications to TCP endpoints in a manner that is\r\ntransparent to socket applications.  It further provides for dynamic\r\ndiscovery of partner RDMA capabilities and dynamic setup of RDMA\r\nconnections, as well as transparent high availability and load\r\nbalancing when redundant RDMA network paths are available.  It\r\nmaintains many of the traditional TCP\/IP qualities of service such as\r\nfiltering that enterprise users demand, as well as TCP socket\r\nsemantics such as urgent data.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7609","errata_url":null}
