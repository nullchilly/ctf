This is generating new\r\nrequirements for many traditional elements of the PSTN, including\r\nTelephone Numbers (TNs).  TNs no longer serve simply as telephone\r\nrouting addresses: they are now identifiers that may be used by\r\nInternet-based services for a variety of purposes including session\r\nestablishment, identity verification, and service enablement.  This\r\nproblem statement examines how the existing tools for allocating and\r\nmanaging telephone numbers do not align with the use cases of the\r\nInternet environment and proposes a framework for Internet-based\r\nservices relying on TNs.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":["SIP","Problem Statement","Real-Time Communication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8396","errata_url":null}
