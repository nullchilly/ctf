Upon a request from the RTP receiver, an auxiliary\r\nunicast RTP retransmission session is set up between a retransmission\r\nserver and the RTP receiver, over which the reference information\r\nabout the new multicast stream the RTP receiver is about to join is\r\ntransmitted at an accelerated rate.  This often precedes, but may\r\nalso accompany, the multicast stream itself.  When there is only one\r\nmulticast stream to be acquired, the RAMS solution works in a\r\nstraightforward manner.  However, when there are two or more\r\nmulticast streams to be acquired from the same or different multicast\r\nRTP sessions, care should be taken to configure each RAMS session\r\nappropriately.  This document provides example scenarios and\r\ndiscusses how the RAMS solution could be used in such scenarios.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":["IPTV","FEC","retransmission"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6659","errata_url":null}
