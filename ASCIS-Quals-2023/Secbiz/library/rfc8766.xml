      <t pn="section-1-1">Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/> and its
      companion technology DNS-based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6763"/> were created to provide IP networking with the ease

      <t pn="section-1-2">For a small home network consisting of just a single link (or a few
      physical links bridged together to appear as a single logical link from
      the point of view of IP), Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/> is sufficient for client devices
      to look up the ".local" host names of peers on the same home network,
      and to use Multicast DNS-based
      Service Discovery (DNS-SD) <xref target="RFC6763" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6763"/> to discover services offered on that
      home network.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">For a larger network consisting of multiple links that are
      interconnected using IP-layer routing instead of link-layer bridging,
      link-local Multicast DNS alone is insufficient because link-local
      Multicast DNS packets, by design, are not propagated onto other
      links.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">Using link-local multicast packets for Multicast DNS was a conscious
      design choice <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/>.  Even when
      limited to a single link, multicast traffic is still generally
      considered to be more expensive than unicast, because multicast traffic
      impacts many devices instead of just a single recipient.  In addition,
      with some technologies like Wi-Fi <xref target="IEEE-11" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE-11"/>, multicast traffic is inherently less
      efficient and less reliable than unicast, because Wi-Fi multicast
      traffic is sent at lower data rates, and is not acknowledged <xref target="I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MCAST"/>.
      Increasing the amount of expensive multicast traffic by flooding it
      across multiple links would make the traffic load even worse.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">Partitioning the network into many small links curtails the spread
      of expensive multicast traffic but limits the discoverability of
      services.
      At the opposite end of the spectrum, using a very large local link with
      thousands of hosts enables better
      service discovery but at the cost of larger amounts of multicast
      traffic.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">Performing DNS-based Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is
      more efficient and doesn't require large multicast domains but does
      require that the relevant data be available in the Unicast DNS
      namespace.
      The Unicast DNS namespace in question could fall within a traditionally
      assigned globally unique domain name, or it could be within a private
      local
      unicast domain name such as ".home.arpa" <xref target="RFC8375" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8375"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">In the DNS-SD specification <xref target="RFC6763" sectionFormat="comma" section="10" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763#section-10" derivedContent="RFC6763"/> ("Populating
      the DNS with Information") discusses various possible ways that a
      service's PTR, SRV, TXT, and address records can make their way into the
      Unicast DNS namespace, including manual zone file configuration <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> <xref target="RFC1035" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1035"/>, DNS Update <xref target="RFC2136" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2136"/> <xref target="RFC3007" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3007"/>, and
      proxies
      of various kinds.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-8">One option is to make the relevant data available in the Unicast DNS
      namespace by
      manual DNS configuration. This option has been used for
      many years at IETF meetings to advertise the IETF terminal room printer.
      Details of this example are given in <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnssd-roadmap" sectionFormat="of" section="A" format="default" derivedLink="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cheshire-dnssd-roadmap-03#appendix-A" derivedContent="ROADMAP">the
      Roadmap document</xref>.  However, this manual DNS configuration is
      labor intensive, error prone, and requires a reasonable degree of DNS
      expertise.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-9">Another option is to populate the Unicast DNS namespace by having
      the devices offering the services do that themselves, using DNS Update
      <xref target="I-D.sctl-service-registration" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="REG-PROT"/>
        <xref target="I-D.sekar-dns-ul" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DNS-UL"/>.
      However, this requires configuration
      of DNS Update keys on those devices, which has proven onerous and
      impractical for simple devices like printers and network cameras.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-10">Hence, to facilitate efficient and reliable DNS-based Service
      Discovery,
      a hybrid is needed that combines the ease of use of
      Multicast DNS with the efficiency and scalability of Unicast DNS.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-11">This document specifies a type of proxy called a "Discovery Proxy"
      that uses Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/>
      to discover
      Multicast DNS records on its local link on demand, and makes
      corresponding
      DNS records visible in the Unicast DNS namespace.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-12">In principle, similar mechanisms could be defined
      for other local discovery protocols, by creating a proxy that
      (i) uses the protocol in question to discover local information on
      demand, and then
      (ii) makes corresponding DNS records visible in the Unicast
      DNS namespace. Such mechanisms for other local discovery
      protocols could be addressed in future documents.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-13">The design of the Discovery Proxy is guided by the previously
      published DNS-based Service Discovery requirements document
      <xref target="RFC7558" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7558"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-14">In simple terms, a descriptive DNS name is chosen for
      each link in an organization.
      Using a DNS NS record, responsibility for that DNS name is delegated to
      a Discovery Proxy physically attached to that link.
      When a remote client issues a unicast query for a name falling
      within
      the delegated subdomain, the normal DNS delegation mechanism
      results in the unicast query arriving at the Discovery Proxy,
      since it has been declared authoritative for those names.
      Now, instead of consulting a textual zone file on disk to discover
      the answer to the query as a traditional authoritative DNS server would,
      a Discovery Proxy consults its local link, using Multicast DNS,
      to find the answer to the question.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-15">For fault tolerance reasons, there may be more than one
      Discovery Proxy serving a given link.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-16">Note that the Discovery Proxy uses a "pull" model.
      Until some remote client has requested data,
      the local link is not queried using Multicast DNS.
      In the idle state, in the absence
      of client requests, the Discovery Proxy sends no packets and imposes
      no burden on the network. It operates purely "on demand".</t>
      <t pn="section-1-17">An alternative proposal that has been discussed is a proxy that
      performs DNS updates to a remote DNS server on behalf of the Multicast
      DNS devices on the local network.  The difficulty with this is that
      Multicast DNS devices do not routinely announce their records on the
      network. Generally, they remain silent until queried.  This means that
      the complete set of Multicast DNS records in use on a link can only be
      discovered by active querying, not by passive listening.  Because of
      this, a proxy can only know what names exist on a link by issuing
      queries for them, and since it would be impractical to issue queries for
      every possible name just to find out which names exist and which do not,
      there is no reasonable way for a proxy to programmatically learn all the
      answers it would need to push up to the remote DNS server using DNS
      Update.  Even if such a mechanism were possible, it would risk
      generating high load on the network continuously, even when there are no
      clients with any interest in that data.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-18">Hence, having a model where the query comes to the Discovery Proxy
      is much more efficient than
      a model where the Discovery Proxy pushes the answers out
      to some other remote DNS server.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-19">A client seeking to discover services and other information performs
      this by sending traditional DNS queries to the Discovery Proxy or by
      sending DNS Push Notification subscription requests <xref target="RFC8765" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8765"/>.</t>

      to which the remote client is directly attached.
      The remote client communicates directly with the Discovery Proxy
      using normal unicast TCP/IP communication mechanisms,
      potentially spanning multiple IP hops,
      possibly including VPN tunnels and other similar
      long-distance communication channels.

      <t pn="section-2-1">A Discovery Proxy does not operate as a multicast relay or multicast
      forwarder.  There is no danger of multicast forwarding loops that result
      in traffic storms, because no multicast packets are forwarded.  A
      Discovery Proxy operates as a <em>proxy</em> for remote clients,
      performing
      queries on their behalf and reporting the results back.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">A reasonable analogy is making a telephone call to a colleague at
      your workplace and saying, "I'm out of the office right now. Would you
      mind bringing up a printer browser window and telling me the names of
      the printers you see?" That entails no risk of a forwarding loop causing
      a traffic storm, because no multicast packets are sent over the
      telephone call.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">A similar analogy, instead of enlisting another human being
      to initiate the service discovery operation on your behalf, is
      to log in to your own desktop work computer using screen sharing
      and then run the printer browser yourself to see the list of printers.
      Or, log in using Secure Shell (ssh) and type "dns-sd -B _ipp._tcp" and
      observe the
      list of discovered printer names. In neither case is there any risk
      of a forwarding loop causing a traffic storm, because no multicast
      packets are being sent over the screen-sharing or ssh connection.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">The Discovery Proxy provides another way of performing remote
      queries,
      which uses a different protocol instead of screen sharing or ssh.
      The Discovery Proxy mechanism can be thought of as a custom Remote
      Procedure Call (RPC) protocol that allows a remote client to exercise
      the Multicast DNS APIs on the Discovery Proxy device, just as a local
      client running on the Discovery Proxy device would use those APIs.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-5">When the Discovery Proxy software performs Multicast DNS
      operations, the exact same Multicast DNS caching mechanisms are
      applied as when any other client software on that Discovery Proxy
      device performs Multicast DNS operations, regardless of whether that be
      running
      a printer browser client locally, a remote user running the
      printer browser client via a screen-sharing connection, a remote
      user logged in via ssh running a command-line tool like "dns-sd",
      or a remote user sending DNS requests that cause a Discovery Proxy
      to perform discovery operations on its behalf.</t>

        <t pn="section-5.1-6">When a DNS-SD client issues a Unicast DNS query to discover
        services in a particular Unicast DNS subdomain
        (e.g., "_ipp._tcp.Building 1.example.com. PTR ?"),
        the normal DNS delegation mechanism results in that query being
        forwarded until it reaches the delegated authoritative name server for
        that subdomain, namely, the Discovery Proxy on the link in question.
        Like a conventional Unicast DNS server, a Discovery Proxy implements
        the usual Unicast DNS protocol <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/> <xref target="RFC1035" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1035"/> over UDP
        and TCP.  However, unlike a conventional Unicast DNS server that
        generates answers from the data in its manually configured zone file,
        a Discovery Proxy learns answers using Multicast DNS.  A Discovery
        Proxy does this by consulting its Multicast DNS cache and/or issuing
        Multicast DNS queries, as appropriate according to the usual protocol
        rules of Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/>,
        for the corresponding Multicast DNS name, type, and class, with the
        delegated zone part of the name replaced with ".local" (e.g., in
        this case, "_ipp._tcp.local. PTR ?").  Then, from the
        received Multicast DNS data, the Discovery Proxy synthesizes the
        appropriate Unicast DNS response, with the ".local" top-level label
        of the owner name
        replaced with the name of the delegated zone.
        Further details of the name translation rules are
        described in <xref target="translation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.5"/>.
        Rules specifying how long the Discovery
        Proxy should wait to accumulate Multicast DNS responses before sending
        its unicast reply are described in <xref target="aggregation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.6"/>.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-7">The existing Multicast DNS caching mechanism is used to minimize
        unnecessary Multicast DNS queries on the wire.  The Discovery Proxy is
        acting as a client of the underlying Multicast DNS subsystem and
        benefits from the same caching and efficiency measures as any other
        client using that subsystem.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-8">Note that the contents of the delegated zone, generated as it is by
        performing ".local" Multicast DNS queries, mirrors the records
        available on the local link via Multicast DNS very closely, but not
        precisely.  There is not a full bidirectional equivalence between the
        two.  Certain records that are available via Multicast DNS may not
        have equivalents in the delegated zone possibly because they are
        invalid or not relevant in the delegated zone or because they are
        being suppressed because they are unusable outside the local link (see
        <xref target="unusable" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.5.2"/>).  Conversely, certain
        records that appear in the delegated zone may not have corresponding
        records available on the local link via Multicast DNS.  In particular,
        there are certain administrative SRV records (see <xref target="admin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>) that logically fall within the delegated zone but
        semantically represent metadata <em>about</em> the zone rather than
	records
        <em>within</em> the zone. Consequently, these administrative records
	in
        the delegated zone do not have any corresponding counterparts in the
        Multicast DNS namespace of the local link.</t>

        issues the identical query on its local link, as a Multicast DNS
	query.
        The mechanism to force an apparently unicast name to be resolved using
        link-local Multicast DNS varies depending on the API set being used.
        For example, in the "dns_sd.h" APIs (available on macOS, iOS, Bonjour
        for Windows, Linux, and Android), using kDNSServiceFlagsForceMulticast
        indicates that the DNSServiceQueryRecord() call should perform the
        query using Multicast DNS.  Other API sets have different ways of
        forcing multicast queries.  When the host owning that IPv4 or IPv6
        address responds with a name of the form "something.local", the
        Discovery Proxy rewrites it to use its configured LDH host name
        domain instead of ".local" and returns the response to the caller.</t>

          TXT record sizes in the range of 500-1000 bytes are not uncommon.
          This information is a legacy from lineprinter (LPR) printing,

          Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) printing does have in-band

          elide unnecessary key/value pairs from the DNS-SD TXT record for
          better network efficiency.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.5.5-3">Also, the DNS-SD TXT record for many printers contains an
          "adminurl" key (e.g.,
          "adminurl=http://printername.local/status.html").  For this URL to
	    be
          useful outside the local link, the embedded ".local" host name needs
          to be translated to an appropriate name with larger scope.  It is
          easy to translate ".local" names when they appear in well-defined
          places: as a record's owner name, or in domain name fields in the
	    RDATA of record types
          like PTR and SRV.  In the printing case, some application-specific
          knowledge about the semantics of the "adminurl" key is needed for
          the Discovery Proxy to know that it contains a name that needs to be
          translated.  This is somewhat analogous to the need for NAT gateways
          to contain ALGs (Application-Level Gateways) to facilitate the
          correct translation of protocols that embed addresses in unexpected
          places.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.5.5-4">To avoid the need for application-specific knowledge about the
          semantics of particular TXT record keys, protocol designers are
          advised to avoid placing link-local names or link-local IP addresses
          in TXT record keys if translation of those names or addresses would
          be required for off-link operation.  In the printing case, the
          consequence of failing to translate the "adminurl" key
          correctly would be that, when accessed from a different link,
	    printing
          will still work, but clicking the "Admin" user interface button will
	    fail to
          open the printer's administration page.  Rather than duplicating the
          host name from the service's SRV record in its "adminurl" key,
          thereby having the same host name appear in two places, a better
          design might have been to omit the host name from the "adminurl"
          key and instead have the client implicitly substitute the target
          host name from the service's SRV record in place of a missing host
          name in the "adminurl" key.  That way, the desired host name only
          appears once and is in a well-defined place where software like
          the Discovery Proxy is expecting to find it.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.5.5-5">Note that this kind of Application-Specific Data Translation is
          expected to be very rare; it is the exception rather than the rule.
          This is an example of a common theme in computing.  It is frequently
          the case that it is wise to start with a clean, layered design with
          clear boundaries. Then, in certain special cases, those layer
          boundaries may be violated where the performance and efficiency
          benefits outweigh the inelegance of the layer violation.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.5.5-6">These layer violations are optional. They are done primarily for
          efficiency reasons and generally should not be required for correct
          operation.  A Discovery Proxy <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> operate solely at
          the mDNS layer without any knowledge of semantics at the DNS-SD
          layer or above.</t>

        <t pn="section-5.6-1">In a simple analysis, simply gathering multicast answers and
        forwarding them in a unicast response seems adequate, but it raises
        the question of how long the Discovery Proxy should wait to be sure
        that it has received all the Multicast DNS answers it needs to form a
        complete Unicast DNS response.  If it waits too little time, then it
        risks its Unicast DNS response being incomplete.  If it waits too
        long, then it creates a poor user experience at the client end.  In
        fact, there may be no time that is both short enough to produce a
        good user experience and at the same time long enough to reliably
        produce complete results.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-2">Similarly, the Discovery Proxy (the authoritative name server for
        the subdomain in question) needs to decide what DNS TTL to report
        for these records.  If the TTL is too long, then the recursive
        resolvers issuing queries on behalf of their clients risk
        caching stale data for too long. If the TTL is too short, then the
        amount of network traffic will be more than necessary.  In fact, there
        may be no TTL that is both short enough to avoid undesirable stale
        data and, at the same time, long enough to be efficient on the
        network.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-3">Both these dilemmas are solved by the use of DNS Long-Lived Queries

        <t pn="section-5.6-5">Clients and Discovery Proxies <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support both
        LLQ and DNS Push Notifications, and when talking to a
        Discovery Proxy that supports both, the client may use either
        protocol, as it chooses, though it is expected that only
        DNS Push Notifications will continue to be supported in the long
        run.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-6">When a Discovery Proxy receives a query using LLQ
        or DNS Push Notifications, it responds immediately using the Multicast
        DNS records it already has in its cache (if any).  This provides a
        good client user experience by providing a near-instantaneous
        response. Simultaneously, the Discovery Proxy issues a Multicast DNS
        query on the local link to discover if there are any additional
        Multicast DNS records it did not already know about. Should additional
        Multicast DNS responses be received, these are then delivered to the
        client using additional LLQ or DNS Push Notification update
        messages.  The timeliness of such update messages is limited only by
        the timeliness of the device responding to the Multicast DNS query. If
        the Multicast DNS device responds quickly, then the update message is
        delivered quickly. If the Multicast DNS device responds slowly, then
        the update message is delivered slowly.  The benefit of using multiple
	update
        messages to deliver results as they become available is that the
	Discovery
        Proxy can respond promptly because it doesn't have to deliver all the
        results in a single response that needs to be delayed to allow for the
        expected worst-case delay for receiving all the Multicast DNS
	responses.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-7">With a proxy that supported only standard DNS queries, even if it
        were to try to provide reliability by assuming an
        excessively pessimistic worst-case time (thereby giving a very poor
        user experience), there would still be the risk of a slow Multicast
        DNS device taking even longer than that worst-case time (e.g., a
	device that is not
        even powered on until ten seconds after the initial query is
	received),
        resulting in incomplete responses.
        Using update messages to deliver subsequent asynchronous replies
	solves this
        dilemma: even very late responses are not lost; they are delivered in
        subsequent update messages.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-8">Note that while normal DNS queries are generally received via the
	client's configured
        recursive resolver, LLQ and DNS Push Notification subscriptions may be
        received directly from the client.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-9">There are two factors that determine how unicast responses
        are generated:</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-10">The first factor is whether or not the Discovery Proxy already has

        <t pn="section-5.6-11">
    The second factor is whether the client used a normal DNS query,
    or established a subscription using LLQ or DNS Push Notifications.
    Normal DNS queries
    are typically used for one-shot operations like SRV or address record
    queries.
    LLQ and DNS Push Notification subscriptions
    are typically used for long-lived service browsing PTR queries.
    Normal DNS queries and LLQ each have different response timing depending
    on the cache state, yielding the first four cases listed below.
    DNS Push Notifications, the newer protocol, has uniform behavior
    regardless of cache state, yielding the fifth case listed below.</t>

        negative response, not NXDOMAIN.  This is because the Discovery Proxy
        cannot know all the Multicast DNS domain names that may exist on a
        link at any given time, so any name with no answers may have child
        names that do exist, making it an "empty non-terminal" name.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-14">Note that certain aspects of the behavior described here
        do not have to be implemented overtly by the Discovery Proxy;
        they occur naturally as a result of using existing Multicast DNS
	APIs.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-15">For example, in the first case above (standard DNS query and no
        answers in the cache), if a new Multicast DNS query is requested
        (either by a local client on the Discovery Proxy device, or by the
        Discovery Proxy software on that device on behalf of a remote client),
        and there is not already an identical Multicast DNS query active and
        there are no matching answers already in the Multicast DNS cache on
        the Discovery Proxy device, then this will cause a series of Multicast
        DNS query packets to be issued with exponential backoff.  The
        exponential backoff sequence in some implementations starts at one
        second and then doubles for each retransmission (0, 1, 3, 7 seconds,
        etc.), and in others, it starts at one second and then triples for
        each retransmission (0, 1, 4, 13 seconds, etc.).  In either case, if
        no response has been received after six seconds, that is long enough
        that the underlying Multicast DNS implementation will have sent three
        query packets without receiving any response.  At that point, the
        Discovery Proxy cancels its Multicast DNS query (so no further
        Multicast DNS query packets will be sent for this query) and returns a
        negative response to the remote client via unicast.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-16">The six-second delay is chosen to be long enough to give enough
        time for devices to respond, yet short enough not to be too onerous
        for a human user waiting for a response.  For example, using the "dig"
        DNS debugging tool, the current default settings result in it waiting
        a total of 15 seconds for a reply (three transmissions of the DNS UDP
        query packet, with a wait of 5 seconds after each packet), which is
        ample time for it to have received a negative reply from a Discovery
        Proxy after six seconds.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.6-17">The text above states that for a standard DNS query,
        if at least one answer is already available in the cache, then a
        Discovery Proxy should not issue additional mDNS query packets.
        This also occurs naturally as a result of using existing
        Multicast DNS APIs. 
   If a new Multicast DNS query is requested
   (either locally, or by the Discovery Proxy on behalf of a remote client)
   for which there are relevant answers already in the Multicast DNS
   cache on the Discovery Proxy device, and after the answers are
   delivered the Multicast DNS query is immediately cancelled, then
   no Multicast DNS query packets will be generated for this query.

            <abstract>
              <t>RFC1034 provided a description of how to cache negative responses.  It however had a fundamental flaw in that it did not allow a name server to hand out those cached responses to other resolvers, thereby greatly reducing the effect of the caching.  This document addresses issues raise in the light of experience and replaces RFC1034 Section 4.3.4. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo.  UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.

            <abstract>
              <t>To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.  Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available.  This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.</t>
              <t>IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks).  This document does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.  In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t>
              <t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.  In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t>
              <t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t>

              <t>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast in 802.11 (wifi) and other local-area wireless environments.  This document describes the problems of known limitations with wireless (primarily 802.11) Layer-2 multicast.  Also described are certain multicast enhancement features that have been specified by the IETF, and by IEEE 802, for wireless media, as well as some operational choices that can be taken to improve the performance of the network.  Finally, some recommendations are provided about the usage and combination of these features and operational choices.</t>

              <t>The DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol uses the standard DNS Update mechanism to enable DNS-Based Service Discovery using only unicast packets.  This eliminates the dependency on Multicast DNS as the foundation layer, which greatly improves scalability and improves performance on networks where multicast service is not an optimal choice, particularly 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and 802.15.4 (IoT) networks. DNS-SD Service registration uses public keys and SIG(0) to allow services to defend their registrations against attack.</t>

              <t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

        <t pn="section-a.1-4">Domain enumeration and unicast querying have been
        used for several years at IETF meetings to make terminal room
        printers discoverable from outside the terminal room. When an IETF
        attendee presses "Cmd‑P" on a Mac, or selects AirPrint on an iPad
        or iPhone, and the terminal room printers appear, it is because
        the client is sending Unicast DNS queries to the IETF DNS servers.
        A walk-through giving the details of this particular specific example
        is given in <xref target="I-D.cheshire-dnssd-roadmap" sectionFormat="of" section="A" format="default" derivedLink="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cheshire-dnssd-roadmap-03#appendix-A" derivedContent="ROADMAP">the Roadmap

        referred to in this specification exists and is deployed
        but was not standardized by the IETF.
        The IETF has developed a superior Long-Lived Query mechanism
        called DNS Push Notifications <xref target="RFC8765" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8765"/>,
        which is built on DNS Stateful Operations <xref target="RFC8490" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8490"/>.
        DNS Push Notifications is implemented and deployed in Mac OS X 10.15
	and later,

        <t pn="section-a.3-1">At the time of writing,
        existing APIs make multiple domains visible to client software,
        but most client user interfaces lump all discovered services
        into a single flat list. This is largely a chicken-and-egg
        problem. Application writers were naturally reluctant to spend
        time writing domain-aware user interface code when few customers would
        benefit from it. If Discovery Proxy deployment becomes common, then
        application writers will have a reason to provide a better user
	experience.
        Existing applications will work with the Discovery Proxy but will
        show all services in a single flat list. Applications with
        improved user interfaces will show services grouped by domain.</t>
