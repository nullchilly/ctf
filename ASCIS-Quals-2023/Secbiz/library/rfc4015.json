It adapts the retransmission timer to avoid further spurious timeouts and (depending on the detection algorithm) can avoid the often unnecessary go-back-N retransmits that would otherwise be sent.  In addition, the Eifel response algorithm restores the congestion control state in such a way that packet bursts are avoided.
