This document\r\nintroduces a series of specifications that define mechanisms and\r\nprotocol extensions needed to fully support internationalized email\r\naddresses.  These changes include an SMTP extension and extension of\r\nemail header syntax to accommodate UTF-8 data.  The document set also\r\nincludes discussion of key assumptions and issues in deploying fully\r\ninternationalized email.  This document is a replacement for RFC\r\n4952; it reflects additional issues identified since that document\r\nwas published.
