This\r\ndocument analyzes all proposed solutions (known at the time of\r\nwriting) for communicating whether the synthesis is taking place,\r\nwhat address format was used, and what IPv6 prefix was used by the\r\nNAT64 and DNS64.  These solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and\r\nlocal IPv6 address synthesis.  The document concludes by recommending\r\nthe standardization of the approach based on heuristic discovery.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["NAT64","DNS64","464XLAT","Pref64::\/n"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7051","errata_url":null}
