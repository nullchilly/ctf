When combined with the\r\nDiameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and Extensible\r\nAuthentication Protocol specifications, this application specification\r\nsatisfies typical network access services requirements.\r\n\r\nInitial deployments of the Diameter protocol are expected to include\r\nlegacy systems.  Therefore, this application has been carefully designed to\r\nease the burden of protocol conversion between RADIUS and\r\nDiameter.  This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute space to\r\neliminate the need to perform many attribute translations.\r\n\r\nThe interactions between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified\r\nin this document are to be applied to all Diameter applications.  In\r\nthis sense, this document extends the Base Diameter protocol.
