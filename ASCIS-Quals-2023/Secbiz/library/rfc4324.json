At the time of this writing, three\r\nvendors are implementing CAP, but it has already been determined that\r\nsome changes are needed.  In order to get implementation experience,\r\nthe participants felt that a CAP specification is needed to preserve\r\nmany years of work.  Many properties in CAP which have had many years\r\nof debate, can be used by other iCalendar protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["calendar user","cu","calendar user agent","cua","ical","calender store","cs"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4324","errata_url":null}
