In addition, these\r\nupdates enable the redirection of bidirectional traffic onto bypass\r\ntunnels that ensure the co-routing of data paths in the forward and\r\nreverse directions after FRR and avoid RSVP soft-state timeout in the\r\ncontrol plane.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["Co-routed LSPs","Bypass assignment coordinate","Restore co-routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4090"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8271","errata_url":null}
