      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol that
        can be used in a wide range of applications, networks, and system
        topologies. That flexibility makes for wide applicability but can
        complicate the application design process. One particular design
        question that has received much attention is how to support multiple
        media streams in RTP. This memo discusses the available options and
        design trade-offs, and provides guidelines on how to use the
        multiplexing features of RTP to support multiple media streams.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
        <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/>
        is a commonly used protocol for real-time media transport. It is a
        protocol that provides great flexibility and can support a large set
        of different applications. From the beginning, RTP was designed for
        multiple participants in a communication session. It supports many
        topology paradigms and usages, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC7667" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7667"/>. RTP has several multiplexing points designed
        for different purposes; these points enable support of multiple RTP streams
        and switching between different encoding or packetization techniques for the
        media. By using multiple RTP sessions, sets of RTP streams can be
        structured for efficient processing or identification. Thus, 
to meet an application's needs, an RTP application designer needs to understand how best to use the RTP
        session, the RTP stream identifier (synchronization source (SSRC)), and the RTP payload type.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">There has been increased interest in more-advanced usage of RTP.
        For example, multiple RTP streams can be used when a single endpoint
        has multiple media sources (like multiple cameras or microphones) from
        which streams of media need to be sent simultaneously. Consequently, questions are raised
        regarding the most appropriate RTP usage. The limitations in some
        implementations, RTP/RTCP extensions, and signaling have also been
        exposed. This document aims to clarify the usefulness
        of some functionalities in RTP that, hopefully, will result in future
        implementations that are more complete.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The purpose of this document is to provide clear information about
        the possibilities of RTP when it comes to multiplexing. The RTP
        application designer needs to understand the implications arising
        from a particular usage of the RTP multiplexing points. This document
        provides some guidelines and recommends against some usages as
        being unsuitable, in general or for particular purposes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document starts with some definitions and then goes into
        existing RTP functionalities around multiplexing. Both the desired
        behavior and the implications of a particular behavior depend on
        which topologies are used; therefore, this topic requires some
        consideration. We then discuss some choices regarding multiplexing
        behavior and the impacts of those choices. Some designs of RTP usage
        are also discussed. Finally, some
        guidelines and examples are provided.</t>

          additional RTP stream is sent within the same RTP session as the other
          RTP streams or it is necessary to use additional RTP sessions to
          group the RTP streams. For a combination of reasons, the suitable choice for one situation might not
          be the suitable choice for another situation. The choice is easiest
          when multiplexing multiple media sources of the same
          media type. However, all reasons warrant discussion and clarification
          regarding how to deal with them. As the discussion below will show, 
a single solution does not suit all purposes.
 To utilize RTP well and as efficiently as
          possible, both are needed.
The real issue is knowing when to create multiple RTP sessions versus when to
send multiple RTP streams in a single RTP session.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-1">An RTP session is the highest semantic layer in RTP
            and represents an association between a group of communicating
            endpoints. RTP does not contain a session identifier, yet different
            RTP sessions must be possible to identify both across a set of different
            endpoints and from the perspective of a single endpoint.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-2">For RTP session separation across endpoints, the set of
            participants that form an RTP session is defined as those that share a
            single SSRC space
            <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/>. That is, if a group of participants are each
            aware of the SSRC identifiers belonging to the other
            participants, then those participants are in a single RTP session. A
            participant can become aware of an SSRC identifier by
            receiving an RTP packet containing the identifier in the SSRC field or
            contributing source (CSRC) list,
            by receiving an RTCP packet listing it in an SSRC field, or through
            signaling (e.g., the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
            <xref target="RFC4566" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4566"/>
            "a=ssrc:" attribute
            <xref target="RFC5576" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5576"/>). Thus, the scope of an RTP session is
            determined by the participants' network interconnection topology, in
            combination with RTP and RTCP forwarding strategies deployed by the
            endpoints and any middleboxes, and by the signaling.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-3">For RTP session separation within a single endpoint, RTP relies on
            the underlying transport layer and the signaling to identify RTP
            sessions in a manner that is meaningful to the application. A single
            endpoint can have one or more transport flows for the same RTP
            session, and a single RTP session can span multiple transport-layer flows even if all endpoints use a single transport-layer flow per endpoint
            for that RTP session. The signaling layer might give RTP sessions an explicit
            identifier, or the identification might be implicit based on the
            addresses and ports used. Accordingly, a single RTP session can have
            multiple associated identifiers, explicit and implicit, belonging to
            different contexts. For example, when running RTP on top of UDP/IP, an
            endpoint can identify and delimit an RTP session from other RTP
            sessions by their UDP source and destination IP addresses and
            their UDP port numbers.
            A single RTP session can be using multiple IP/UDP flows for receiving and/or
            sending RTP packets to other endpoints or middleboxes, even if the
            endpoint does not have multiple IP addresses. Using multiple IP addresses
            only makes it more likely that multiple IP/UDP flows will be
            required. Another example is SDP media descriptions (the "m=" line and the
            subsequent associated lines) that signal the transport flow and RTP session
            configuration for the endpoint's part of the RTP session. The SDP grouping
            framework
            <xref target="RFC5888" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5888"/>
            allows labeling of the media descriptions to be used so that
            RTP Session Groups can be created. Through the use of 
            <xref target="RFC8843" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8843">"Negotiating Media Multiplexing Using the
            Session Description Protocol (SDP)"</xref>,
            multiple media descriptions become part of a common RTP session where each
            media description represents the RTP streams sent or received for a media source.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-4">RTP makes no normative statements about the
            relationship between different RTP sessions; however, applications
            that use more than one RTP session need to understand how the
            different RTP sessions that they create relate to one another.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.2-1">An SSRC identifies a source of an RTP
            stream, or an RTP receiver when sending RTCP. Every endpoint has at
            least one SSRC identifier, even if it does not send RTP packets. RTP
            endpoints that are only RTP receivers still send RTCP and use their
            SSRC identifiers in the RTCP packets they send. An endpoint can have
            multiple SSRC identifiers if it sends multiple RTP streams. Endpoints
            that function as both RTP sender and RTP receiver use the same SSRC(s) in
            both roles.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.2-2">The SSRC is a 32-bit identifier. It is present in every RTP and

            using the SDP "a=ssrc:" attribute
            <xref target="RFC5576" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5576"/>, the SSRC is chosen at random. It is not
            dependent on the network address of the endpoint and is intended to
            be unique within an RTP session. SSRC collisions can occur and are
            handled as specified in

            streams or receivers changing. An endpoint that changes
            its network transport address during a session has to choose a new
            SSRC identifier to avoid being interpreted as a looped source, unless
            a mechanism providing a virtual transport (such as Interactive

            corresponding RTCP source description (SDES) packets. SDP signaling can also be used to

            guarantee that SSRC values are unique across RTP sessions. In the

            <xref target="RFC4588" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4588"/>,

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.4-1">Each RTP stream utilizes one or more RTP payload formats. An RTP
            payload format describes how the output of a particular media codec is

            identified by the payload type (PT) field in the RTP packet header.
            The combination of SSRC and PT therefore identifies a specific RTP stream
            in a specific encoding format. The format definition can be taken from

            session. All SSRCs sent from a single endpoint share the same payload
            type definitions. The RTP payload type is designed such that only a
            single payload type is valid at any instant in time in the RTP stream's
            timestamp timeline, effectively time-multiplexing different payload
            types if any change occurs. The payload type can change on a

            SSRCs up to date.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4.3-8">One RTP/RTCP-based grouping solution is to use the RTCP SDES CNAME to bind
            related RTP streams to an endpoint or a synchronization context. For
            applications with a single RTP stream per type (media, source, or
            redundancy stream), the CNAME is sufficient for that purpose, independent of whether one or more RTP sessions
            are used. However, some applications choose not to use a CNAME because of
            perceived complexity or a desire not to implement RTCP and instead use
            the same SSRC value to bind related RTP streams across multiple RTP
            sessions. RTP retransmission
            <xref target="RFC4588" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4588"/>,

            <xref target="RFC5109" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5109"/>
            both use the CNAME method to relate the RTP streams, which may work but might have some
            downsides in RTP sessions with many participating SSRCs. It is not recommended to
            use identical SSRC values across RTP sessions to relate RTP streams; when an SSRC
            collision occurs, this will force a change of that SSRC in all RTP
            sessions and will thus resynchronize all of the streams instead of only the single
            media stream experiencing the collision.</t>

            when using the same RTP session as the source RTP stream for retransmissions.
            A receiver that is missing a packet issues an RTP retransmission
            request and then awaits a new SSRC carrying the RTP retransmission
            payload, where that SSRC is from the same CNAME. This limits a
            requester to having only one outstanding retransmission request on any
            new SSRCs per endpoint.</t>

            provides an RTP/RTCP-based mechanism to unambiguously identify the RTP
            streams within an RTP session and restrict the streams' payload format
            parameters in a codec-agnostic way beyond what is provided with the
            regular payload types. The mapping is done by specifying an "a=rid"
            value in the SDP offer/answer signaling and having the corresponding
            RtpStreamId value as an SDES item and an RTP header extension
            <xref target="RFC8852" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8852"/>. The
            RID solution also includes a solution for binding redundancy RTP
            streams to their original source RTP streams, given that those
            streams use RID
            identifiers. The redundancy stream uses the RepairedRtpStreamId
            SDES item and RTP header extension to declare the RtpStreamId
            value of the source stream to create the binding.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4.4-1">There exist a number of FEC-based schemes designed to mitigate packet loss in the original streams.
            Most of the FEC schemes protect a single source flow. This
            protection is achieved by transmitting a certain amount of redundant
            information that is encoded such that it can repair one or more
            instances of packet
            loss over the set of packets the redundant information protects.
            This sequence of redundant information needs to be transmitted as
            its own media stream or, in some cases, instead of the original media
            stream. Thus, many of these schemes create a need for binding related
            flows, as discussed above. Looking at the history of these schemes,
            there are schemes using multiple SSRCs and schemes using multiple RTP
            sessions, and some schemes that support both modes of operation.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4.4-2">Using multiple RTP sessions supports the case where some set of
            receivers might not be able to utilize the FEC information. By placing
            it in a separate RTP session and if separating RTP sessions at the
            transport level, FEC can easily be ignored at the transport level,
            without considering any RTP-layer information.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.4.4-3">In usages involving multicast, sending FEC information in a separate multicast group allows for similar flexibility. This is especially
            useful when receivers see heterogeneous packet loss rates. A receiver
            can decide, based on measurement of experienced packet loss rates,
            whether to join a multicast group with suitable FEC data repair
            capabilities.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.1-3">There are two fundamental approaches to building a gateway: using
            RTP translator interworking (RTP bridging), where the gateway acts

            need to use media streams in a way that makes sense in both applications.

            all the applications are using the same codecs with the same payload
            types, have made the same multiplexing choices, and have the same
            capabilities regarding the number of simultaneous RTP streams combined with the
            same set of RTP/RTCP extensions being supported. Unfortunately, this
            might not always be true.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-2">When a gateway is implemented via an RTP translator, an important
            consideration is if the two applications being interconnected need to
            use the same approach to multiplexing. If one side is using RTP
            session multiplexing and the other is using SSRC multiplexing with BUNDLE
            <xref target="RFC8843" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8843"/>, it may be possible
            for the RTP translator to map the RTP streams between both
            sides using some method, e.g., based on the number and order of SDP "m="
            lines from each side. There are also challenges related to
            SSRC collision handling, since, unless SSRC translation is applied on the
            RTP translator, there may be a collision on the SSRC multiplexing
            side that the RTP session multiplexing side will not be aware of.
            Furthermore, if one of the applications is capable of
            working in several modes (such as being able to use additional RTP
            streams in one RTP session or multiple RTP sessions at will) and the
            other one is not, successful interconnection depends on locking the
            more flexible application into the operating mode where
            interconnection can be successful, even if none of the participants are using
            the less flexible application when the RTP sessions are being created.</t>

            integrity of the incoming packets and then re-encrypt, integrity protect,
            and sign the packets as the peer in the other application's security context.
            This is necessary even if all that's needed is a simple remapping of SSRC
            numbers. If this is done, the gateway also needs to be a member of the
            security contexts of both sides and thus a trusted entity.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.3-4">The gateway might also need to apply transcoding (for
            incompatible codec types), media-level adaptations that cannot be
            solved through media negotiation (such as rescaling for incompatible
            video size requirements), suppression of content that is known not to
            be handled in the destination application, or the addition or removal
            of redundancy coding or scalability layers to fit the needs of the
            destination domain.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.3-5">From the above, we can see that the gateway needs to have an
            intimate knowledge of the application requirements; a gateway is by
            its nature application specific and not a commodity product.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.3-6">These gateways might therefore potentially block
            application evolution by blocking RTP and RTCP extensions that the
            applications have been extended with but that are unknown to the
            gateway.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.3-7">If one uses a security mechanism like SRTP, the gateway and the
            necessary trust in it by the peers pose an additional risk to 
            communication security. The gateway also incurs additional
            complexities in the 
            form of the decrypt-encrypt cycles needed for each forwarded packet.
            SRTP, due to its keying structure, also requires that each RTP session
            need different master keys, as the use of the same key in two RTP
            sessions can, for some ciphers, result in a reuse of a one-time pad that
            completely breaks the confidentiality of the packets.</t>

                large number of simultaneous streams. However, if the application uses
                ICE to authenticate STUN requests, a server can serve multiple
                endpoints from the same local port and use the whole 5-tuple (source

                the NAT. That state is a limited resource. In home or Small

                memory or processing. For large-scale NATs serving many internal

                Port limitations are primarily a problem for larger centralized NATs

                pair following the specified ICE procedures is 1.5*RTT +
                Ta*(Additional_Flows-1), where Ta is the pacing timer. That assumes a
                message in one direction, immediately followed by a
return message in the opposite direction to confirm reachability.
                It isn't more, because ICE first finds one candidate pair
                that works, prior to attempting to establish multiple flows. Thus,
                there is no extra time until one has found a working candidate pair.

                The risk of this happening is hard to quantify but should be fairly
                low, as one flow from the same interfaces has just been successfully
                established. Thus, only such rare events as NAT resource overload,

            which imposes degradation for all participants. For broadcast-type
            applications with a large number of receivers, this is not
            acceptable. Instead, various receiver-based solutions are employed to
            ensure that the receivers achieve the best possible performance. By using
            scalable encoding and placing each scalability layer in a different
            multicast group, the receiver can control the amount of traffic it
            receives. To have each scalability layer in a different multicast

              <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.  The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.

It is based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics. It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

The results of using multiple DSCPs to obtain different QoS treatments within a single network 5-tuple have transport protocol interactions, particularly with congestion control functionality (e.g., reordering).  In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the traffic source and destination.  This memo covers the implications of these Diffserv aspects for real-time network communication, including WebRTC.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-dismissing-payload-type-mul">Dismissing Payload Type Multiplexing</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-1">This section documents a number of reasons why using the payload
        type as a multiplexing point is unsuitable for most issues related to
        multiple RTP streams. Attempting to use payload type multiplexing
        beyond its defined usage has well-known negative effects on RTP, as
        discussed below.
        To use the payload type as the single discriminator for multiple streams
        implies that all the different RTP streams are being sent with the
        same SSRC, thus using the same timestamp and sequence number space.
        The many effects of using payload type multiplexing are as follows:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-appendix.a-2">
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.1" derivedCounter="1.">Constraints are placed on the RTP timestamp rate for the multiplexed media.
            For example, RTP streams that use different RTP timestamp rates cannot
            be combined, as the timestamp values need to be consistent across all
            multiplexed media frames. Thus, streams are forced to use the same RTP
            timestamp rate. When this is not possible, payload type multiplexing
            cannot be used.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.2" derivedCounter="2.">Many RTP payload formats can fragment a media object over multiple
            RTP packets, like parts of a video frame. These payload formats need
            to determine the order of the fragments to correctly decode them.
            Thus, it is important to ensure that all fragments related to a frame
            or a similar media object are transmitted in sequence and without
            interruptions within the object. This can be done relatively easily
            on the sender side by ensuring that the fragments of each RTP stream
            are sent in sequence.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.3" derivedCounter="3.">Some media formats require uninterrupted sequence number space
            between media parts. These are media formats where any missing RTP
            sequence number will result in decoding failure or invoking a repair
            mechanism within a single media context. The text⁠/t140 payload format
            <xref target="RFC4103" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4103"/>
            is an example of such a format. These formats will need a sequence
            numbering abstraction function between RTP and the individual RTP
            stream before being used with payload type multiplexing.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.4" derivedCounter="4.">Sending multiple media streams in the same sequence number space
        makes it
            impossible to determine which media stream lost a packet.
            Such a scenario causes difficulties, since the receiver cannot determine to which stream it should
            apply packet-loss concealment or other stream-specific
            loss-mitigation mechanisms.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.5" derivedCounter="5.">If RTP retransmission
            <xref target="RFC4588" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4588"/>
            is used and packet loss occurs, it is possible to ask for the missing
            packet(s) by SSRC and sequence number -- not by payload type. If only
            some of the payload type multiplexed streams are of interest, there is
            no way to tell which missing packet or packets belong to the
            stream or streams of interest, and all lost packets need to be requested, wasting bandwidth.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.6" derivedCounter="6.">The current RTCP feedback mechanisms are built around providing
            feedback on RTP streams based on stream ID (SSRC), packet (sequence
            numbers), and time interval (RTP timestamps). There is almost never a
            field to indicate which payload type is reported, so sending feedback
            for a specific RTP payload type is difficult without extending
            existing RTCP reporting.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.7" derivedCounter="7.">The current RTCP media control messages specification
            <xref target="RFC5104" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5104"/>
            is oriented around controlling particular media flows,
            i.e., requests are done by addressing a particular SSRC. Such mechanisms
            would need to be redefined to support payload type multiplexing.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.8" derivedCounter="8.">The number of payload types is inherently limited. Accordingly,
            using payload type multiplexing limits the number of streams that can
            be multiplexed and does not scale. This limitation is exacerbated if
            one uses solutions like RTP and RTCP multiplexing
            <xref target="RFC5761" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5761"/>
            where a number of payload types are blocked due to the overlap between
            RTP and RTCP.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.9" derivedCounter="9.">At times, there is a need to group multiplexed streams. This is
            currently possible for RTP sessions and SSRCs, but there is no
            defined way to group payload types.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.10" derivedCounter="10.">It is currently not possible to signal bandwidth requirements per
            RTP stream when using payload type multiplexing.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.11" derivedCounter="11.">Most existing SDP media-level attributes cannot be applied on a
            per-payload-type basis and would require redefinition in that context.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.a-2.12" derivedCounter="12.">A legacy endpoint that does not understand the indication that
            different RTP payload types are different RTP streams might be
            slightly confused by the large amount of possibly overlapping or
            identically defined RTP payload types.</li>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-2">We document some issues here that need to be addressed when using some form of signaling to establish RTP sessions. These
           issues cannot be addressed by simply tweaking, extending, or profiling

        <t indent="0" pn="section-b.1-1">One aspect of existing signaling protocols is that they are focused on
          RTP sessions or, in the case of SDP, the concept of media
          descriptions. A number of things are signaled at the media
          description level, but those are not necessarily strictly bound to
          an RTP session and could be of interest for signaling, especially
          for a particular RTP stream (SSRC) within the session.
  The following properties have been
 identified as being potentially useful for signaling, and not only
 at the RTP session level:</t>

          limitations. However, if the aim is to deploy a solution that uses
          several SSRCs and contains several sets of RTP streams with
          different properties (encoding/packetization parameters, bitrate,
          etc.), putting each set in a different RTP session would directly
          enable negotiation of the parameters for each set. If insisting on
          additional SSRCs only, a number of signaling extensions are needed to

          set of RTP streams being sent or received. RTP applications will need

          stream and its usage. In other applications, there exists a default
          handling method that is appropriate.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-b.3-3">If all RTP streams in an RTP session are to be treated in the same
          way, identifying the session is enough. If SSRCs in a session are to
          be treated differently, signaling needs to identify both the session
          and the SSRC.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-b.3-4">If this signaling affects how any RTP central node, like an RTP
          mixer or translator that selects, mixes, or processes streams, treats
          the streams, the node will also need to receive the same signaling to
          know how to treat RTP streams with different usages in the right
          fashion.</t>
