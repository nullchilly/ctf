Music on hold\r\nmeans that when one party to a call has the call \"on hold\", that\r\nparty's telephone provides an audio stream (often music) to be heard\r\nby the other party.  Architectural features of SIP make it difficult\r\nto implement music on hold in a way that is fully standards-compliant.\r\nThe implementation of music on hold described in this\r\ndocument is fully effective, is standards-compliant, and has a number\r\nof advantages over the methods previously documented.  In particular,\r\nit is less likely to produce peculiar user interface effects and more\r\nlikely to work in systems that perform authentication than the music-on-hold\r\nmethod described in Section 2.3 of RFC 5359.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":["Music on hold"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7088","errata_url":null}
