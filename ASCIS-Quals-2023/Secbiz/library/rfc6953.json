The concept of allowing additional\r\ntransmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a\r\ntechnique to \"unlock\" existing spectrum for new use.  This document\r\nincludes the problem statement for the development of a protocol to\r\naccess a database of white-space information followed by use cases\r\nand requirements for that protocol.  Finally, requirements associated\r\nwith the protocol are presented.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6953","errata_url":null}
