The proposed attribute, the \"altc\" attribute, solves the\r\nbackward-compatibility problem that plagued Alternative Network\r\nAddress Types (ANAT) due to their syntax.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is applicable to scenarios where connectivity\r\nchecks are not required.  If connectivity checks are required,\r\nInteractive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), as specified in RFC\r\n5245, provides such a solution.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6947","errata_url":null}
