It also\r\ndescribes ways to mitigate these threats, in particular by using\r\ntechniques from the SCTP Specification Errata and Issues memo (RFC\r\n4460).  These techniques are included in RFC 4960, which obsoletes\r\nRFC 2960.  It is hoped that this information will provide some useful\r\nbackground information for many of the newest requirements spelled\r\nout in the SCTP Specification Errata and Issues and included in RFC\r\n4960.
