This document describes extensions to LSP ping so that LSP\r\nping can be used for on-demand connectivity verification of MPLS\r\nTransport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs and pseudowires.  This document also\r\nclarifies procedures to be used for processing the related OAM\r\npackets.  Further, it describes procedures for using LSP ping to\r\nperform connectivity verification and route tracing functions in\r\nMPLS-TP networks.  Finally, this document updates RFC 4379 by adding\r\na new address type and creating an IANA registry.
