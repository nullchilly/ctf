This document specifies mechanisms\r\nto authenticate the PIM-SM link-local messages using the IP security\r\n(IPsec) Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) or (optionally) the\r\nAuthentication Header (AH).  It specifies optional mechanisms to\r\nprovide confidentiality using the ESP.  Manual keying is specified as\r\nthe mandatory and default group key management solution.  To deal\r\nwith issues of scalability and security that exist with manual\r\nkeying, optional support for an automated group key management\r\nmechanism is provided.  However, the procedures for implementing\r\nautomated group key management are left to other documents.  This\r\ndocument updates RFC 4601.
