In other terms, such operation can be\r\nseen as a way of transferring the ownership and control of an\r\nexisting and in-use data plane connection between the management\r\nplane and the control plane, leaving its data plane state untouched.\r\n\r\nThis memo sets out the requirements for such procedures within a\r\nGeneralized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) network.
