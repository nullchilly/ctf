In the Split MAC mode, the partitioning of\r\nencryption\/decryption functions is not clearly defined.  In the Split\r\nMAC mode description, IEEE 802.11 encryption is specified as located\r\nin either the Access Controller (AC) or the WTP, with no clear way\r\nfor the AC to inform the WTP of where the encryption functionality\r\nshould be located.  This leads to interoperability issues, especially\r\nwhen the AC and WTP come from different vendors.  To prevent\r\ninteroperability issues, this specification defines an IEEE 802.11\r\nMAC Profile message element in which each profile specifies an\r\nunambiguous division of encryption functionality between the WTP and\r\nAC.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["CAPWAP","MAC Profile","Encryption","IEEE 802.11"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7494","errata_url":null}
