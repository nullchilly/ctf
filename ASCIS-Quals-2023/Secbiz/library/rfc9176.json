These problems can be solved by\r\nemploying an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains\r\ninformation about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups\r\nto be performed for those resources. The input to an RD is composed\r\nof links, and the output is composed of links constructed from the\r\ninformation stored in the RD. This document specifies the web\r\ninterfaces that an RD supports for web servers to discover the RD and\r\nto register, maintain, look up, and remove information on resources.\r\nFurthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD\r\nare defined.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["CoRE","Web Linking","Resource Discovery","Resource Directory"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9176","errata_url":null}
