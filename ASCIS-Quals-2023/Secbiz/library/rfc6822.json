Routers will form instance-specific adjacencies.\r\nEach instance can support multiple topologies.  Each topology has a\r\nunique Link State Database (LSDB).  Each Protocol Data Unit (PDU)\r\nwill contain a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) identifying the instance\r\nand the topology (or topologies) to which the PDU belongs.","pub_date":"December 2012","keywords":["intermediate system to intermediate system"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8202"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6822","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6822"}
