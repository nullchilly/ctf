This \"Internet-Draft-to-be\", though never formally\r\npublished at that time, was widely circulated and became the de facto\r\nstandard for implementors of News Servers and User Agents, rapidly\r\nacquiring the nickname \"Son of 1036\".  Indeed, under that name, it\r\ncould fairly be described as the best-known Internet Draft (n)ever\r\npublished, and it formed the starting point for the recently adopted\r\nProposed Standards for Netnews.\r\n\r\nIt is being published now in order to provide the historical\r\nbackground out of which those standards have grown.  Present-day\r\nimplementors should be aware that it is NOT NOW APPROPRIATE for use\r\nin current implementations.  This document defines a Historic \r\nDocument for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["netnews","usenet","rfc 1036","usefor","historic"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5536","RFC5537"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC1849","errata_url":null}
