In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with\r\nroutable IP addresses, which are advertised in Link State\r\nAdvertisements (LSAs) but are not needed for data traffic.  In addition,\r\nremote attacks can be launched against routers by sending packets to\r\nthese transit-only networks.  This document presents a mechanism to\r\nhide transit-only networks to speed up network convergence and reduce\r\nvulnerability to remote attacks.\r\n\r\nIn the context of this document, 'hiding' implies that the prefixes\r\nare not installed in the routing tables on OSPF routers.  In some\r\ncases, IP addresses may still be visible when using OSPFv2.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFCs 2328 and 5340.
