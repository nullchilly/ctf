One type of P2MP tree that may be used is known as an\r\n\"Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel\".  In an IR tunnel, a parent node\r\nneed not be directly connected to its child nodes.  When a parent node\r\nhas to send a multicast data packet to its n child nodes, it does not\r\nuse Layer 2 multicast, IP multicast, or MPLS multicast to do so.\r\nRather, it makes n individual copies, and then unicasts each copy,\r\nthrough an IP or MPLS unicast tunnel, to exactly one child node.\r\nWhile the prior MVPN specifications allow the use of IR tunnels, those\r\nspecifications are not always very clear or explicit about how the\r\nMVPN protocol elements and procedures are applied to IR tunnels.  This\r\ndocument updates RFCs 6513 and 6514 by adding additional details that\r\nare specific to the use of IR tunnels.","pub_date":"October 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6513","RFC6514"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7988","errata_url":null}
