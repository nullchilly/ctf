	  delay <xref target="RFC7679" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7679"/>, and jitter <xref target="RFC3393" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3393"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Methodologies and tools are therefore needed to monitor and accurately measure 
	  network performance, in order to constantly control the quality of experience
      perceived by the end customers. Performance monitoring also provides useful information for
	  improving network management (e.g., isolation of network problems, troubleshooting, etc.).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3"><xref target="RFC7799" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7799"/> defines Active, Passive, and Hybrid Methods of Measurement.
	  In particular, Active Methods of Measurement depend on a dedicated measurement packet stream;
	  Passive Methods of Measurement are based solely on observations of an undisturbed and unmodified 
	  packet stream of interest; Hybrid Methods are Methods of Measurement that use a combination of 
      Active Methods and Passive Methods.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document proposes a performance monitoring technique, called the "Alternate-Marking Method", 
	  which is potentially applicable to any kind of packet-based traffic, both point-to-point unicast and multicast, including Ethernet, IP, and MPLS. The method primarily addresses packet-loss measurement, but it can be easily 
	  extended to one-way or two-way delay and delay variation measurements as well.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">The Alternate-Marking methodology, described in this document, allows the synchronization of the measurements
	  at different points by dividing the packet flow into batches. So it is possible to get coherent counters and timestamps
	  in every marking period and therefore measure the Performance Metrics for the monitored flow.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">The method has been explicitly designed for Passive or Hybrid measurements as stated in <xref target="RFC8321" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8321"/>. 
	  But, according to the definitions of <xref target="RFC7799" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7799"/>, the Alternate-Marking Method can be classified 
	  as Hybrid Type I. Indeed, Alternate Marking can be implemented by using reserved bits in the protocol header, and
	  the change in value of these marking bits at the domain edges (and not along the path) is formally considered a 
	  modification of the stream of interest.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">It is worth mentioning that this is a methodology document, so the mechanism that can be used to transmit 
	  the counters and the timestamps is out of scope here. Additional details about the applicability of the Alternate-Marking	
 	  methodology are described in <xref target="IEEE-NETWORK-PNPM" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE-NETWORK-PNPM"/>.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">In order to perform packet-loss measurements on a production traffic flow,
      different approaches exist. The most intuitive one consists in numbering
      the packets so that each router that receives the flow can immediately
      detect a packet that is missing. This approach, though very simple in theory, is
      not simple to achieve: it requires the insertion of a sequence number
      into each packet, and the devices must be able to extract the number and
      check it in real time. Such a task can be difficult to implement on live
      traffic: if UDP is used as the transport protocol, the sequence number
      is not available; on the other hand, if a higher-layer sequence number
      (e.g., in the RTP header) is used, extracting that information from each
      packet and processing it in real time could overload the device.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">An alternate approach is to count the number of packets sent on one
      end, count the number of packets received on the other end, and compare the
      two values. This operation is much simpler to implement, but it requires
      the devices performing the measurement to be in sync: in order to
      compare two counters, it is required that they refer exactly to the same
      set of packets. Since a flow is continuous and cannot be stopped when a
      counter has to be read, it can be difficult to determine exactly when
      to read the counter. A possible solution to overcome this problem is to
      virtually split the flow in consecutive blocks by periodically
      inserting a delimiter so that each counter refers exactly to the same block of
      packets. The delimiter could be, for example, a special packet inserted
      artificially into the flow. However, delimiting the flow using specific
      packets has some limitations. First, it requires generating additional
      packets within the flow and requires the equipment to be able to process
      those packets. In addition, the method is vulnerable to out-of-order
      reception of delimiting packets and, to a lesser extent, to their
      loss.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">The method proposed in this document follows the second approach, but
      it doesn't use additional packets to virtually split the flow in blocks.
      Instead, it "marks" the packets so that the packets belonging to the
      same block will have the same notional "color", whilst consecutive blocks 
	  will have different colors. Each change of color represents a sort of
      auto-synchronization signal that enhances the consistency of
      measurements taken by different devices along the path.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4"><xref target="Measurements" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> represents a very simple network and shows 
	  how the method can be used to measure packet loss on different network segments: by
      enabling the measurement on several interfaces along the path, it is
      possible to perform link monitoring, node monitoring, or end-to-end
      monitoring. The method is flexible enough to measure packet loss on any
      segment of the network and can be used to isolate the faulty
      element.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-11">Traffic coloring can be done by R1 itself if the traffic is not already colored. 
		R1 needs two counters, C(A)R1 and C(B)R1, on its egress
        interface: C(A)R1 counts the packets with color A and C(B)R1 counts
        those with color B. As long as traffic is colored as A, only counter
        C(A)R1 will be incremented, while C(B)R1 is not incremented;
        conversely, when the traffic is colored as B, only C(B)R1 is
        incremented. C(A)R1 and C(B)R1 can be used as reference values to
        determine the packet loss from R1 to any other measurement point down
        the path. Router R2, similarly, will need two counters on its ingress
        interface, C(A)R2 and C(B)R2, to count the packets received on that interface and colored 
        with A and B, respectively. When an A
        block ends, it is possible to compare C(A)R1 and C(A)R2 and calculate
        the packet loss within the block; similarly, when the successive B
        block terminates, it is possible to compare C(B)R1 with C(B)R2, and so
        on, for every successive block.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-12">Likewise, by using two counters on the R2 egress interface, it is
        possible to count the packets sent out of the R2 interface and use them as

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-13">The length of the blocks can be chosen large enough to simplify 
		the collection and the comparison of measures taken by different 
		network devices. It's preferable to read the value of the counters 
		not immediately after the color switch: some packets could arrive
		out of order and increment the counter associated with the
        previous block (color), so it is worth waiting for some time. 
		A safe choice is to wait L/2 time units (where L is the duration 
		for each block) after the color switch, to read the counter of 
		the previous color (<xref target="sync-timing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>). 
		The drawback is that the longer the duration of the block, the less
        frequently the measurement can be taken.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-16">The flow-based strategy is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> when implementing this specification.
		It requires the identification of the flow to be monitored and the discovery 
		of the path followed by the selected flow. It is possible to monitor a single flow 
		or multiple flows grouped together, but in this case, measurement is consistent 
		only if all the flows in the group follow the same path.
        Moreover, if a measurement is performed by grouping many flows, it is not 
		possible to determine exactly which flow was affected by packet loss. 
		In order to have measures per single flow, it is necessary to configure 
		counters for each specific flow. Once the flow(s) to be monitored has 
		been identified, it is necessary to configure the monitoring on the proper nodes.
        Configuring the monitoring means configuring the rule to intercept the
        traffic and configuring the counters to count the packets. To have just
        an end-to-end monitoring, it is sufficient to enable the monitoring on
        the first- and last-hop routers of the path: the mechanism is
        completely transparent to intermediate nodes and independent of the
        path followed by traffic flows. On the contrary, to monitor the flow on
        a hop-by-hop basis along its whole path, it is necessary to enable the
        monitoring on every node from the source to the destination. In case the
        exact path followed by the flow is not known a priori (i.e., the flow has
        multiple paths to reach the destination), it is necessary to enable the
        monitoring on every path: counters on interfaces traversed by the flow 
		will report packet count, whereas counters on other interfaces will be null.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-1">The alternation of colors can be used as a time reference to calculate 
        the delay.  Whenever the color changes (which means that a new block has 
		started), a network device can store the timestamp of the first packet of 
		the new block; that timestamp can be compared with the timestamp of the 
		same packet on a second router to compute packet delay.
		When looking at <xref target="coloring" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>, R1 stores the timestamp TS(A1)R1
		when it sends the first packet of block 1 (A-colored), the timestamp 
		TS(B2)R1 when it sends the first packet of block 2 (B-colored), and
		so on for every other block.
		R2 performs the same operation on the receiving side, recording TS(A1)R2, 
		TS(B2)R2, and so on. Since the timestamps refer to specific packets (the first
        packet of each block), in the case where no packet loss or misordering exists,
		we would be sure that timestamps compared to compute delay refer to the same packets. 
		By comparing TS(A1)R1 with TS(A1)R2 (and similarly TS(B2)R1 with TS(B2)R2, and so on), 
		it is possible to measure the delay between R1 and R2. 
		In order to have more measurements, it is possible to take and store more timestamps,
        referring to other packets within each block. 
		The number of measurements could be increased by considering multiple packets
		in the block; for instance, a timestamp could be taken every N packets, thus 
		generating multiple delay measurements.  Taking this to the limit, in principle, 
		the delay could be measured for each packet by taking and comparing the

		Furthermore, a measurement is valid only if no packet loss occurs and if packet misordering 
		can be avoided; otherwise, the first packet of a block on R1 could be
        different from the first packet of the same block on R2 (for instance, if that
        packet is lost between R1 and R2 or it arrives after the next
        one). Since packet misordering is generally undetectable, it is not possible
		to check whether the first packet on R1 is the same on R2, and this is part of

		  to out-of-order reception of packets. In order to overcome this problem, 
		  an approach based on the concept of mean delay can be considered. The mean
          delay is calculated by considering the average arrival time of the
          packets within a single block. The network device locally stores a
          timestamp for each packet received within a single block: summing
          all the timestamps and dividing by the total number of packets
          received, the average arrival time for that block of packets can be
          calculated. By subtracting the average arrival times of two adjacent
          devices, it is possible to calculate the mean delay between those
          nodes. 
		  This method greatly reduces the number of timestamps that have to be collected
		  (only one per block for each network device), and it is robust to out-of-order 
		  packets with only a small error introduced in case of packet loss.
		  But, when computing the mean delay, the measurement error could be augmented by accumulating 
		  the measurement error of a lot of packets. Additionally, it only gives one measure

          delay values <xref target="RFC6703" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6703"/>. 
		  This limitation could be overcome by reducing the duration of the block

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.2-2">Basically, the idea is to use the first marking to create the alternate

		  may be used for mean delay measurement. The second marking creates a new set of 
		  marked packets that are fully identified over the network so that a network device 
		  can store the timestamps of these packets. These timestamps can be compared 
		  with the timestamps of the same packets on the next node to compute packet 
		  delay values for each packet. The number of measurements can be easily 
		  increased by changing the frequency of the second marking.
                  But the frequency of the second marking must not be too high in order to 
		  avoid out-of-order issues. Between packets with the second marking, there 
		  should be an adequate time gap to avoid out-of-order issues and also to have
		  a number of measurement packets that are rate independent. This gap may be, 
		  at the minimum, the mean network delay calculated with the previous methodology.
		  Therefore, it is possible to choose a proper time gap to guarantee a fixed number 
		  of double-marked packets uniformly spaced in each block.
		  If packets with the second marking are lost, it is easy to recognize the loss
		  since the number of double-marked packets is known for each block. 
		  Based on the spacing between these packets, it can also be possible to understand
		  which packet of the second marking sequence has been lost and perform the measurements 
		  only for the remaining packets. But this may be complicated if more packets
		  are lost. In this case, an implementation may simply discard the delay measurements
		  for the corrupted block and proceed with the next block.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.2-3">An efficient and robust mode is to select a single packet with the second marking 
		  for each block; in this way, there is no time gap to consider between the double-marked packets 
		  to avoid their reorder. In addition, it is also easier to identify the only double-marked packet
		  in each block and skip the delay measurement for the block if it is lost.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.2-4">The Double-Marking methodology can also be used to get more statistics 
		  of delay extent data, e.g., percentiles, variance, and median delay values. 
		  Indeed, a subset of batch packets is selected for extensive delay calculation by using the second marking, 
		  and it is possible to perform a detailed analysis on these double-marked packets. 
		  It is worth noting that there are classic algorithms for median and variance calculation, 
		  but they are out of the scope of this document.
		  The conventional range (maximum-minimum) should be avoided for several reasons, 
		  including stability of the maximum delay due to the influence by outliers.

			<xref target="RFC7680" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7680"/>. The same concept, with small 
			differences, can also be used to measure delay
			<xref target="RFC7679" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7679"/> and jitter
			<xref target="RFC3393" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3393"/>.  
			The document mainly describes the applicability to packet-loss 
			measurement.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.2">Method of Measurement or Calculation: according to the method
            described in the previous sections, the number of packets lost is
            calculated by subtracting the value of the counter on the source
            node from the value of the counter on the destination node.  Both
            counters must refer to the same color.  The calculation is
            performed when the value of the counters is in a steady state.
			The steady state is an intrinsic characteristic of the marking method 
			counters because the alternation of color makes the counter associated 
			with a color inactive for the duration of a marking period.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.3">Units of Measurement: the method calculates and reports the exact
            number of packets sent by the source node and not received by the
            destination node.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.4">Measurement Point(s) with Potential Measurement Domain: the measurement can be performed between
            adjacent nodes, on a per-link basis, or along a multi-hop path,
            provided that the traffic under measurement follows that path.  In
            case of a multi-hop path, the measurements can be performed both
            end to end and hop by hop.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.5">Measurement Timing: the method has a constraint on the frequency
            of measurements. This is detailed in <xref target="sync-timing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>, where it is specified that
			the marking period and the guard band interval are strictly related to each other
			to avoid out-of-order issues. That is because, in order to perform a measurement, 
			the counter must be in a steady state, and this happens when the traffic is being
            colored with the alternate color.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.6">Implementation: the method uses one or two marking bits to color the packets; 
			this enables the use of policy configurations on the router to color the packets
            and accordingly configure the counter for each color.  The path
            followed by traffic being measured should be known in advance in
            order to configure the counters along the path and be able to
            compare the correct values.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.7">Verification: the methodology has been tested and deployed experimentally 
			in both lab and operational network scenarios performing packet loss and delay measurements 
			on traffic patterns created by traffic generators together with precision test instruments 
			and network emulators.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.8">Use and Applications: the method can be used to measure packet
            loss with high precision on live traffic; moreover, by combining 
			end-to-end and per-link measurements, the method is useful to pinpoint 
			the single link that is experiencing loss events.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.9">Reporting Model: the value of the counters has to be sent to a
            centralized management system that performs the calculations; such
            samples must contain a reference to the time interval they refer
            to so that the management system can perform the correct
            correlation. The samples have to be sent while the corresponding
            counter is in a steady state (within a time interval); otherwise,
            the value of the sample should be stored locally.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.10">Dependencies: the values of the counters have to be correlated to
            the time interval they refer to.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.11">Organization of Results: the Method of Measurement produces
            singletons, according to the definition of <xref target="RFC2330" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2330"/>.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.12">Parameters: the main parameters of the method are the information about 
			the flow or the link to be measured, the time interval chosen to alternate the 
			colors and to read the counters, and the type of method selected for packet-loss 
			and delay measurements.</li>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-1">This document specifies a method to perform measurements that does not 
	  directly affect Internet security nor applications that run on the Internet.
	  However, implementation of this method must be mindful of security and privacy
      concerns.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
      the measurements and potential harm to the measurements. 
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-10-3">
        <li pn="section-10-3.1">Harm caused by the measurement: the measurements described in this document
      are Passive, so there are no new packets injected into the network causing
      potential harm to the network itself and to data traffic. Nevertheless,
      the method implies modifications on the fly to a header or encapsulation 
	  of the data packets: this must be performed in a way that doesn't alter the quality
      of service experienced by packets subject to measurements and that
      preserves stability and performance of routers doing the measurements.
	  One of the main security threats in Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols is network reconnaissance;
	  an attacker can gather information about the network performance by passively 
	  eavesdropping on OAM messages. The advantage of the methods described in 
	  this document is that the marking bits are the only information that is exchanged 
	  between the network devices. Therefore, Passive eavesdropping on data plane traffic 
	  does not allow attackers to gain information about the network performance.</li>
        <li pn="section-10-3.2">Harm to the Measurement: the measurements could be harmed by routers altering 
	  the marking of the packets or by an attacker injecting artificial
      traffic. Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be
      used where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. 
	  Since the measurement itself may be affected by routers (or other
      network devices) along the path of IP packets intentionally altering the
      value of marking bits of packets, as mentioned above, the mechanism specified 
	  in this document can be applied just in the context of a controlled domain;
	  thus, the routers (or other network devices) are locally administered, 
	  and this type of attack can be avoided.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">An attacker that does not belong to the controlled domain can maliciously send marked packets.
	  However, no problems occur if Alternate Marking is not supported in the controlled domain. 
If Alternate Marking is supported in the controlled domain, it is necessary to keep the 
  measurements from being affected; therefore, externally marked packets
  must be checked to see if they are marked and eventually filtered or cleared.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-5">The precondition for the application of the Alternate-Marking Method is that it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be applied in specific 
	  controlled domains, thus confining the potential attack vectors within the network domain.
	  A limited administrative domain provides the network administrator with the means to select, monitor, and 
	  control the access to the network, making it a trusted domain. In this regard, it is expected to enforce policies
      at the domain boundaries to filter both external marked packets entering the domain and internal marked packets
	  leaving the domain. Therefore, the trusted domain is unlikely subject to the hijacking of packets since marked packets 
	  are processed and used only within the controlled domain. But despite that, leakages may happen for 
	  different reasons, such as a failure or a fault. In this case, nodes outside the domain are expected to 
	  ignore marked packets since they are not configured to handle it and should not process it.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-6">It might be theoretically possible to modulate the marking to serve as a covert channel to be used by an 
	  on-path observer. This may affect both the data and management plane, but, here too, the application to a 
	  controlled domain helps to reduce the effects.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-7">It is worth highlighting that an attacker can't gain information about network performance
	  from a single monitoring point; they must use synchronized monitoring points at multiple points on the path
	  because they have to do the same kind of measurement and aggregation that Service Providers using 
	  Alternate Marking must do.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-8">Attacks on the data collection and reporting of the statistics between 
	  the monitoring points and the NMS can interfere with the proper
      functioning of the system. Hence, the channels used to report back flow statistics
	  <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be secured.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-9">The privacy concerns of network measurement are limited because the
      method only relies on information contained in the header or encapsulation without 
	  any release of user data. Although information in the header or encapsulation is metadata that 
	  can be used to compromise the privacy of users, the limited marking technique in this document 
	  seems unlikely to substantially increase the existing privacy risks from header 
	  or encapsulation metadata. It might be theoretically possible to modulate the marking to serve 
	  as a covert channel, but it would have a very low data rate if it is to avoid adversely affecting 
	  the measurement systems that monitor the marking.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-10">Delay attacks are another potential threat in the context of this document. 
	  Delay measurement is performed using a specific packet in each block, marked by 
	  a dedicated color bit. Therefore, an on-path attacker can selectively 
	  induce synthetic delay only to delay-colored packets, causing systematic error in 
	  the delay measurements. As discussed in previous sections, the methods described 
	  in this document rely on an underlying time synchronization protocol. Thus, by 
	  attacking the time protocol, an attacker can potentially compromise the integrity 
	  of the measurement. A detailed discussion about the threats against time protocols 
	  and how to mitigate them is presented in <xref target="RFC7384" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7384"/>.</t>

   Flow Measurement Techniques that employ few marking bits, inside the

   locate the network segment where impairments happen.  Different

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), specified in RFC 4656, provides a common protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network devices.  OWAMP can be used bi-directionally to measure one-way metrics in both directions between two network elements.  However, it does not accommodate round-trip or two-way measurements.  This memo specifies a Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), based on the OWAMP, that adds two-way or round-trip measurement capabilities.  The TWAMP measurement architecture is usually comprised of two hosts with specific roles, and this allows for some protocol simplifications, making it an attractive alternative in some circumstances.

              <t indent="0">Packet delay variation metrics appear in many different standards documents. The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerable flexibility, and it allows multiple formulations of delay variation through the specification of different packet selection functions.</t>
              <t indent="0">Although flexibility provides wide coverage and room for new ideas, it can make comparisons of independent implementations more difficult. Two different formulations of delay variation have come into wide use in the context of active measurements. This memo examines a range of circumstances for active measurements of delay variation and their uses, and recommends which of the two forms is best matched to particular conditions and tasks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">There is a noticeable trend towards network behaviors and semantics that are specific to a particular set of requirements applied within a limited region of the Internet. Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the style of network management, and security requirements may vary between such limited regions. This document reviews examples of such limited domains (also known as controlled environments), notes emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy. It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains. Finally, it shows the need for a precise definition of "limited domain membership" and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary nodes.</t>
