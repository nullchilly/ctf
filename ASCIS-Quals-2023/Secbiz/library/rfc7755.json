In this\r\ndeployment model, traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the\r\nInternet is translated to IPv6 upon reaching the IDC operator's\r\nnetwork infrastructure.  From that point on, it may be treated the\r\nsame as traffic from native IPv6 end users.  The IPv6 endpoints may\r\nbe numbered using arbitrary (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses.\r\nThis facilitates a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure, as\r\nwell as efficient utilization of public IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nThe primary audience is IDC operators who are deploying IPv6, running\r\nout of available IPv4 addresses, and\/or feeling that dual stack\r\ncauses undesirable operational complexity.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["Data Centre","Data Center","Dual Stack","Single Stack","IDC","IPv4","IPv4 conservation","IPv4 exhaustion","IPv6-only","IPv6 only","IPv6 transition","IPv6 transition technology","XLAT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7755","errata_url":null}
