This document defines a framework enabling\r\napplication protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and\r\ncomparison of internationalized strings (\"PRECIS\") in a way that\r\ndepends on the properties of Unicode characters and thus is agile\r\nwith respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework\r\nprovides a more sustainable approach to the handling of\r\ninternationalized strings than the previous framework, known as\r\nStringprep (RFC 3454).
