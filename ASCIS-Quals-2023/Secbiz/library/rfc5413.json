One of the\r\nprimary goals is to find a solution that solves the interoperability\r\nbetween the two classes of devices (WTPs and ACs) that then enables\r\nan AC from one vendor to control and manage a WTP from another.\r\n\r\nIn this document, we present a protocol that forms the common\r\ntechnology-independent framework and the ability to negotiate and\r\nadd, on top of this framework, a control protocol that contains a\r\ntechnology-dependent component to arrive at a complete solution.  We\r\nhave also presented two such control protocols -- an 802.11 Control\r\nprotocol, and another, more generic image download protocol, in this\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nEven though the text in this document is written to specifically address\r\nthe problem stated in RFC 3990, the solution can be applied to any problem\r\nthat has a controller (equivalent to the AC) managing one or more\r\nnetwork elements (equivalent to the WTP).  This document defines a \r\nHistoric Document for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["capwap"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5413","errata_url":null}
