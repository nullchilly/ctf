Hierarchical\r\nmobility management for Mobile IPv6 is designed to reduce the amount\r\nof signalling between the mobile node, its correspondent nodes, and\r\nits home agent.  The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) described in this\r\ndocument can also be used to improve the performance of Mobile IPv6\r\nin terms of handover speed.
