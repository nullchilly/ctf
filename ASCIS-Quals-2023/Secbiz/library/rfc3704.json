As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.  This memo updates RFC 2827.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
