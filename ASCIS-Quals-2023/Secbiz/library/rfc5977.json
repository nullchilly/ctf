RMD is a technique for adding\r\nadmission control and preemption function to Differentiated Services\r\n(Diffserv) networks.  The RMD QoS Model allows devices external to the\r\nRMD network to signal reservation requests to Edge nodes in the RMD\r\nnetwork.  The RMD Ingress Edge nodes classify the incoming flows into\r\ntraffic classes and signals resource requests for the corresponding\r\ntraffic class along the data path to the Egress Edge nodes for each\r\nflow.  Egress nodes reconstitute the original requests and continue\r\nforwarding them along the data path towards the final destination.  In\r\naddition, RMD defines notification functions to indicate overload\r\nsituations within the domain to the Edge nodes.  This document defines\r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["next steps in signaling","resource managment in diffserv"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5977","errata_url":null}
