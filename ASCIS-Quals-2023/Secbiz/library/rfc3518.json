PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines the NCP for establishing and configuring Remote Bridging for PPP links. This document obsoletes RFC 2878, which was based on the IEEE 802.1D- 1993 MAC Bridge.  This document extends that specification by improving support for bridge control packets.
