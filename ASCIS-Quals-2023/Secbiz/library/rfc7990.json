With these changes comes an increase in\r\ncomplexity for authors, consumers, and the publisher of RFCs.  This\r\ndocument serves as the framework that provides the problem statement,\r\nlays out a road map of the documents that capture the specific\r\nrequirements, and describes the transition plan.","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":["Format","xml2rfcv3","v3"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7990","errata_url":null}
