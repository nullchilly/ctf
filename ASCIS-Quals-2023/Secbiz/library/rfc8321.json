This method is based on an\r\nAlternate-Marking (coloring) technique.  A report is provided in\r\norder to explain an example and show the method applicability.  This\r\ntechnology can be applied in various situations, as detailed in this\r\ndocument, and could be considered Passive or Hybrid depending on the\r\napplication.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["Alternate Marking","Marking Method","Coloring Technique"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9341"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8321","errata_url":null}
