The public key is used to verify digital\r\nsignatures, and the associated data is used to constrain the types of\r\ninformation for which the trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying\r\nparty uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object is\r\nvalid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor's\r\npublic key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the\r\nassociated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some\r\nof the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor\r\nmanagement mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and\r\npush-based protocols designed to address these problems.  This \r\ndocument is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["PKI","certificates","digital signatures"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6024","errata_url":null}
