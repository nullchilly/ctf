It also\r\ndescribes different mechanisms for comparing and matching these to\r\nlanguage tags.  Two kinds of matching mechanisms, filtering and\r\nlookup, are defined.  Filtering produces a (potentially empty) set of\r\nlanguage tags, whereas lookup produces a single language tag.\r\nPossible applications include language negotiation or content\r\nselection.  This document, in combination with RFC 4646, replaces RFC\r\n3066, which replaced RFC 1766.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"September 2006","keywords":["[--------|b]","Lang-Tag"],"obsoletes":["RFC3066"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0047"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4647","errata_url":null}
