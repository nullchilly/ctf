All of these fields are subject to a\r\nregistry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group has\r\ncreated ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are stable and have\r\nmultiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand\r\noff the registries to IANA for official management.  This document\r\ndescribes the necessary IANA actions.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7116","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7116"}
