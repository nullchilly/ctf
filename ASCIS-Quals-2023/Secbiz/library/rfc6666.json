Remote\r\ntriggered black hole routing describes a method of selectively re-\r\nrouting traffic into a sinkhole router (for further analysis) based\r\non destination address.  This document updates the \"IPv6 Special\r\nPurpose Address Registry\" by explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix\r\nshould be formally assigned by IANA for the purpose of facilitating\r\nIPv6 remote triggered black hole filtering and routing.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for \r\ninformational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["RTBH","black hole"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6666","errata_url":null}
