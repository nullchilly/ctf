By\r\ninteracting with applications, users can guide the way in which they\r\noperate.  The focus of this framework is stimulus signaling, which\r\nallows a user agent (UA) to interact with an application without\r\nknowledge of the semantics of that application.  Stimulus signaling\r\ncan occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or to\r\na remote user interface, through media streams.  Stimulus signaling\r\nencompasses a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from clicking on\r\nhyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional Dual-Tone Multi-\r\nFrequency (DTMF) input.  In all cases, stimulus signaling is\r\nsupported through the use of markup languages, which play a key role\r\nin this framework.
