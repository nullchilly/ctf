The proposed extension is useful for single-source multicast\r\nsessions such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where\r\nthe traditional model of many-to-many group communication is either\r\nnot available or not desired.  In addition, it can be applied to any\r\ngroup that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized\r\nreporting mechanism.
