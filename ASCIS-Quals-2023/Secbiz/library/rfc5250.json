Opaque\r\nLSAs provide a generalized mechanism to allow for the future\r\nextensibility of OSPF.  Opaque LSAs consist of a standard LSA header\r\nfollowed by application-specific information.  The information field\r\nmay be used directly by OSPF or by other applications.  Standard OSPF\r\nlink-state database flooding mechanisms are used to distribute Opaque\r\nLSAs to all or some limited portion of the OSPF topology.\r\n\r\nThis document replaces RFC 2370 and adds to it a mechanism to\r\nenable an OSPF router to validate Autonomous System (AS)-scope Opaque\r\nLSAs originated outside of the router's OSPF area.
