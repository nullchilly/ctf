Often,\r\nhowever, content distribution applications use network resources\r\ninefficiently.  One way to improve efficiency is to introduce storage\r\ncapabilities within the network and enable cooperation between\r\nend-host and in-network content distribution mechanisms.  This is the\r\ncapability provided by a DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE)\r\nsystem, which is introduced in this document.  DECADE enables\r\napplications to take advantage of in-network storage when\r\ndistributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end\r\nresources.  This document presents the underlying principles and key\r\nfunctionalities of such a system and illustrates operation through a\r\nset of examples.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["decade"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7069","errata_url":null}
