The body of this\r\ndocument, except for the intellectual property considerations\r\nsection, is taken from the CT-KIP Version 1.0 document, but comments\r\nreceived during the IETF review are reflected; hence, the status of a\r\nrevised version.  As no \"bits-on-the-wire\" have changed, the protocol\r\nspecified herein is compatible with CT-KIP Version 1.0.\r\n\r\nCT-KIP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and\r\nconfiguration) of cryptographic tokens.  The protocol requires\r\nneither private-key capabilities in the cryptographic tokens, nor an\r\nestablished public-key infrastructure.  Provisioned (or generated)\r\nsecrets will only be available to the server and the cryptographic\r\ntoken itself.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
