This can be used to detect\r\nchanges of mailbox ownership and thus prevent mail from being\r\ndelivered to the wrong party.  This document also defines a header\r\nfield called \"Require-Recipient-Valid-Since\" that can be used to\r\ntunnel the request through servers that do not support the extension.\r\n\r\nThe intended use of these facilities is on automatically generated\r\nmessages, such as account statements or password change instructions,\r\nthat might contain sensitive information, though it may also be\r\nuseful in other applications.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":["Security","Privacy","Email","Account Expiration"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7293","errata_url":null}
