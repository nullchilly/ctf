It achieves this by marking packets belonging to\r\nPCN-flows when the rate of traffic exceeds certain configured\r\nthresholds on links in the domain.  These marks can then be evaluated\r\nto determine how close the domain is to being congested.  This\r\ndocument specifies how such marks are encoded into the IP header by\r\nredefining the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints\r\nwithin such domains.  The baseline encoding described here provides\r\nonly two PCN encoding states: Not-marked and PCN-marked.  Future\r\nextensions to this encoding may be needed in order to provide more\r\nthan one level of marking severity.
