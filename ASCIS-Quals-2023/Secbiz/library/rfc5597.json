These requirements\r\nallow DCCP applications, such as streaming applications, to operate\r\nconsistently, and they are very similar to the TCP requirements for\r\nNATs, which have already been published by the IETF.  Ensuring that\r\nNATs meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the\r\nlikelihood that applications using DCCP will function properly.  This \r\ndocument specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"September 2009","keywords":["[--------]","dccp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0150"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5597","errata_url":null}
