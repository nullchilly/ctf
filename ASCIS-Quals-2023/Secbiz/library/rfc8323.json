The message layer of\r\nCoAP over UDP includes support for reliable delivery, simple\r\ncongestion control, and flow control.\r\n\r\nSome environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over\r\nreliable transports such as TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS).\r\nThis document outlines the changes required to use CoAP over TCP,\r\nTLS, and WebSockets transports.  It also formally updates RFC 7641\r\nfor use with these transports and RFC 7959 to enable the use of\r\nlarger messages over a reliable transport.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["CoAP","Constrained Application Protocol","REST","IoT","Internet of Things","NAT Traversal","CoAP in Browsers"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7641","RFC7959"],"updated_by":["RFC8974"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8323","errata_url":null}
