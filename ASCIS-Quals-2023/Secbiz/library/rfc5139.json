This format is designed for use with Presence Information\r\nData Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the\r\ncivic location format in RFC 4119.  The format is based on the civic\r\naddress definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on\r\nthe civic types defined for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\r\n(DHCP), and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity\r\nschemes.  The format also includes support for the xml:lang language\r\ntag and restricts the types of elements where appropriate.
