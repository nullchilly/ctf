      <t pn="section-abstract-1">NAT64 (Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers) allows client devices using IPv6 to
      communicate with servers that have only IPv4 connectivity.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-2">The specification for how a client discovers its local network's
      NAT64 prefix (RFC 7050) defines the special name
      'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose.
      However, in its Domain Name Reservation
      Considerations section (Section 8.1),
      that specification (RFC 7050) indicates that the name
      actually has no particularly special properties that would require
      special handling.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-3">Consequently, despite the well-articulated special purpose of the
      name,
      'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the
      Special-Use Domain Names registry
      as a name with special properties.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-4">This document updates RFC 7050.
      It describes the special treatment required and
      formally declares the special properties of the name.
      It also adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping

      <t pn="section-2-1">The hostname 'ipv4only.arpa' is peculiar in that it was never
      intended
      to be treated like a normal hostname.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">A typical client never has any reason to look up the IPv4 address
      records for 'ipv4only.arpa': no normal user is ever trying to view a
      website hosted at that domain name or trying to send email to an email
      address at that domain name.  The name 'ipv4only.arpa' is already known,
      <xref target="RFC7050" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7050">by IETF specification</xref>, to
      have exactly two IPv4 address records: 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171.  No
      client ever has to look up the name in order to learn those two
      addresses.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">In contrast, clients often look up the IPv6 AAAA address records for
      'ipv4only.arpa', which is contrary to general DNS expectations, given
      that it is already known, <xref target="RFC7050" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7050">by
      IETF specification</xref>, that 'ipv4only.arpa' is an IPv4-only name,
      and it has no IPv6 AAAA address records.  And yet, clients expect to
      receive, and do in fact receive, positive answers for these IPv6 AAAA
      address records that apparently should not exist.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">This odd query behavior comes not because clients are using DNS to
      learn
      legitimate answers from the name's legitimate authoritative
      server, but because the DNS protocol has, in effect, been co-opted as an
      improvised
      client-to-middlebox communication protocol to look for a DNS64/NAT64
      <xref target="RFC6147" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6147"/> <xref target="RFC6146" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6146"/>
      gateway and, if one is present,
      to request that it disclose the prefix it is using for IPv6 address
      synthesis.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-5">This use of specially crafted DNS queries as an improvised
      client-to-middlebox communication protocol has a number of specific
      consequences, outlined below, which client software needs to take into
      account if the queries are to produce the desired results.  This
      is particularly true
      when used on a multihomed host or when a VPN tunnel is in use.  The
      name 'ipv4only.arpa' is most definitely a special name and needs to be
      listed in IANA's registry along with <xref target="SUDN" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SUDN">other DNS names that have special uses</xref>.</t>

        On a NAT64 network, it is essential that the client use the
        DNS64 recursive resolver recommended for that network, since only that
	recursive resolver can
        be relied upon to know the appropriate prefix(es) to use for
	synthesizing IPv6
        addresses that will be acceptable to that NAT64 gateway.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-3">However, it is becoming increasingly common for users to manually
	override their
        default DNS configuration because they wish to use some other public
	recursive
        resolver on the Internet, which may offer better speed, reliability,
        or privacy than the local network's default recursive resolver.
        At the time of writing, examples of widely known public recursive
	resolver services
        include
        <xref target="DNS1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DNS1">Cloudflare Public DNS</xref>,
        <xref target="DNS8" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DNS8">Google Public DNS</xref>, and
        <xref target="DNS9" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DNS9">Quad9</xref>.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-4">Another common scenario is the use of corporate or personal VPN client
 software.  



Both for privacy reasons and because the local network's recursive resolver
will typically be unable to provide answers for the company's private internal
host names, VPN client software usually overrides the local network's default
configuration to divert some or all DNS requests so that they go to the
company's own private internal recursive resolver instead of to the default
recursive resolver the client learned from its local network. (The company's
own private internal recursive resolvers typically have addresses that are
themselves reached through the VPN tunnel, not via the public Internet.)

As with the case described above of public recursive resolver services, the
company's private internal recursive resolver cannot be expected to be able to
synthesize IPv6 addresses correctly for use with the local network's NAT64
gateway, because the company's private internal recursive resolver is unlikely
to be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use on the NAT64 network to which the
client device is currently attached.  It is clear that a single recursive
resolver cannot meet both needs.  The local network's recursive resolver
cannot be expected to give answers for some unknown company's private internal
host names, and a company's private internal recursive resolver cannot be
expected to give correctly synthesized IPv6 addresses suitable for some
unknown local network's NAT64 gateway.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-5">Note that multiple NAT64 services may be simultaneously available to a
client.  For example, the local network may provide NAT64 service (to allow an
IPv6-only client device to access IPv4-only Internet services), while at the
same time, a corporate VPN may also provide NAT64 service (to allow a client
connecting via an IPv6-only VPN tunnel to access IPv4-only corporate
services).  The NAT64 address synthesis prefixes for the two NAT64 services
may be different.  In this case, it is essential that the NAT64 address
synthesis prefix used on the local network be the prefix learned from the
local network's recursive resolver, and the NAT64 address synthesis prefix
used on the VPN tunnel be the prefix learned from the VPN tunnel's recursive
resolver.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-6">The difficulty here arises because DNS is being used for two
	unrelated purposes.
        The first purpose is retrieving data from a (nominally) global
	database,
        generally retrieving the IP address(es) associated with a hostname.
        The second purpose is using the DNS protocol as a middlebox
	communication
        protocol, to interrogate the local network infrastructure to discover
        the IPv6 prefix(es) in use by the local NAT64 gateway for address
	synthesis.</t>

      performance, better reliability, and correct operation.</t>
      <t pn="section-4-2">These changes affect two bodies of software: (a) the name resolution
      APIs and libraries on client devices, and (b) DNS64 implementations.</t>
      <t pn="section-4-3">The new special rules specified in this document for name resolution
      APIs and libraries
      state how they
      should select which recursive resolver to query to learn the IPv6
      address
      synthesis prefix in use on a particular physical or virtual interface.
      Specifically, when querying for the name 'ipv4only.arpa',
      name resolution APIs and libraries should use the
      recursive resolver recommended by the network for the interface in
      question rather than
      a recursive resolver configured manually,
      a recursive resolver configured by VPN software, or
      a full-service recursive resolver running on the local host.
      Superficially, this might seem like a security issue, since
      the user might have explicitly configured the particular DNS resolver
      they
      wish to use, and rather than using that, the name resolution code
      ignores the user's stated preference and uses untrusted input received
      from the network instead.
      However, the 'ipv4only.arpa' query is not really a DNS query in the
      usual sense;
      even though it may look like a DNS query, it is actually an improvised
      client-to-middlebox communication protocol in disguise.
      For NAT64 to work at all,
      it is necessary for the interface on which NAT64 translation is being
      performed to tell the host the address of the DNS64 recursive resolver
      the host must use to learn the NAT64 prefix being used by that NAT64.
      This is typically done

      <t pn="section-4-5">A useful property of the way <xref target="RFC7050" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7050">NAT64 Prefix Discovery</xref> was originally specified
      was that it allowed for incremental deployment.  Even if existing DNS64
      gateways, that were unaware of the special 'ipv4only.arpa' name, were
      already deployed, once IANA created the appropriate 'ipv4only.arpa'
      records, clients could begin to use the new facility immediately.


      Clients could send their special queries for 'ipv4only.arpa' to an
      ipv4only-unaware DNS64 gateway, and, as a side effect of its usual query
      processing (after a query to IANA's servers), the DNS64 gateway would
      then generate the correct synthesized response.
</t>
      <t pn="section-4-6">While this was a useful transition strategy to enable rapid adoption,
      it is not the ideal end situation.
      For better performance, better reliability, and lower load in IANA's

      it is preferable for DNS64 gateways to be aware of the special
      'ipv4only.arpa' name so that they can avoid issuing unnecessary queries.
      Network operators who wish to provide reliable, high-performance service

      specification</xref> provides the mechanism for the query initiator to
      learn the NAT64 prefix so that it can do its own validation and DNS64
      synthesis as described above.  With this mechanism, the client can (i)
      interrogate the local DNS64/NAT64 gateway (with an 'ipv4only.arpa'
      query)
      to learn the IPv6 address synthesis prefix, (ii) query for the (signed)
      IPv4 address records for the desired hostname and validate the response,
      and then (iii)
      perform its own IPv6 address synthesis locally, combining the IPv6
      address synthesis prefix learned from the local DNS64/NAT64 gateway with
      the validated DNSSEC-signed data learned from the global Domain Name
      System.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-5">It is conceivable that, over time, if DNSSEC adoption continues to
      grow, the
      majority of clients could move to this validate-and-synthesize-locally
      model, which reduces the DNS64 machinery to the vestigial role of
      simply responding to the 'ipv4only.arpa' query to report the local
      IPv6 address synthesis prefix.
      At the time of publication, network operators have been
      observed "in the wild" deploying NAT64 service with DNS
      recursive resolvers that reply to 'ipv4only.arpa' queries
      but otherwise perform no other NAT64 address synthesis.
      In no case does the client care what
      answer(s) the authoritative 'arpa' name servers might give for that
      query.
      The 'ipv4only.arpa' query is being used purely as a local
      client-to-middlebox communication message.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-6">This validate-and-synthesize-locally
      approach is even more attractive if it does not create
      an additional dependency on the authoritative 'arpa' name
      servers to answer a query that is unnecessary
      because the DNS64/NAT64 gateway already knows the answer
      before it even issues the query. Avoiding this unnecessary
      query improves performance and reliability for the client
      and reduces unnecessary load for the authoritative 'arpa' name
      servers.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-7">Hardcoding the known answers for
      'ipv4only.arpa' IPv4 address record queries (DNS qtype "A") in
      recursive resolvers also reduces the risk of malicious devices
      intercepting those queries and returning incorrect answers.
      Because the 'ipv4only.arpa' zone has to be an insecure delegation (see
      below),
      DNSSEC cannot be used to protect these answers from tampering
      by malicious devices on the path.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-8">With respect to the question of whether 'ipv4only.arpa' should be a

      secure delegation, and 'ipv4only.arpa' were a signed zone, then the path
      from the authoritative server to the DNS64 recursive resolver would
      still work, but DNSSEC is not necessary here.  Run-time cryptographic

              <t>DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records. DNS64 is used with an IPv6/IPv4 translator to enable client-server communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server, without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node, for the class of applications that work through NATs.  This document specifies DNS64, and provides suggestions on how it should be deployed in conjunction with IPv6/IPv4 translators.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

The method depends on the existence of a well-known IPv4-only fully qualified domain name "ipv4only.arpa.".
