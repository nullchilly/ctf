One\r\nissue is with the handling of multi-destination packet distribution\r\ntrees.  Other issues are with TRILL switch nicknames.  How are such\r\nnicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network?  Do nicknames\r\nneed to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network?  Or can\r\nthey merely be unique within each multilevel area?\r\n\r\nThis informational document enumerates and examines alternatives\r\nbased on a number of factors including backward compatibility,\r\nsimplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["aggregaged nickname","unique nickname"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8243","errata_url":null}
