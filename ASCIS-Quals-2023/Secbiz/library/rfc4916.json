Elwell"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"24","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Session Initiation Protocol","abstract":"This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol\r\n(SIP) User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to\r\nsupply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the\r\nreverse direction, and for that identity to be signed by an\r\nAuthentication Service.  Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming\r\nrequest (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives\r\nit (the User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from\r\nthat in the To header field.  The same mechanism can be used to\r\nindicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some\r\naction in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a\r\ngateway.  This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP).
