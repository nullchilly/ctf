JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding\r\nsystem. Compared to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher\r\nresolutions and video frame rates while offering visually lossless\r\nquality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency\r\nconfined to a fraction of a video frame.","pub_date":"October 2021","keywords":["video","transport","protocol","joint","photographic","experts","group","real-time","stream"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9134","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9134"}
