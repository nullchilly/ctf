It is anticipated that Service Providers\r\nwill use this Shared Address Space to number the interfaces that\r\nconnect CGN devices to Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).\r\n\r\nShared Address Space is distinct from RFC 1918 private address space\r\nbecause it is intended for use on Service Provider networks.\r\nHowever, it may be used in a manner similar to RFC 1918 private\r\naddress space on routing equipment that is able to do address\r\ntranslation across router interfaces when the addresses are identical\r\non two different interfaces.  Details are provided in the text of\r\nthis document.\r\n\r\nThis document details the allocation of an additional special-use\r\nIPv4 address block and updates RFC 5735.
