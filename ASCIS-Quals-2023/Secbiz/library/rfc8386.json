Some of these functions can only be implemented\r\nefficiently using such mechanisms.  When using broadcast or multicast\r\nmessages, a passive observer in the same broadcast or multicast\r\ndomain can trivially record these messages and analyze their content.\r\nTherefore, designers of protocols that make use of broadcast or\r\nmulticast messages need to take special care when designing their\r\nprotocols.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["IP broadcasts","multicast","privacy considerations"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8386","errata_url":null}
