The following DSDL schema languages are addressed by the\r\nmapping: Regular Language for XML Next Generation (RELAX NG),\r\nSchematron, and Schematron and Document Schema Renaming Language\r\n(DSRL).  The mapping takes one or more YANG modules and produces a\r\nset of DSDL schemas for a selected target document type -- datastore\r\ncontent, Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) messages, etc.\r\nProcedures for schema-based validation of such documents are also\r\ndiscussed.
