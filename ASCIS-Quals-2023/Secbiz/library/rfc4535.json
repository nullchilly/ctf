The GSAKMP provides a\r\nsecurity framework for creating and managing cryptographic\r\ngroups on a network.  It provides mechanisms to disseminate\r\ngroup policy and authenticate users, rules to perform\r\naccess control decisions during group establishment and\r\nrecovery, capabilities to recover from the compromise of\r\ngroup members, delegation of group security functions, and\r\ncapabilities to destroy the group.  It also generates group\r\nkeys.
