There are many\r\nsuch algorithms available, and two TCP-AO systems cannot interoperate\r\nunless they are using the same algorithms.  This document specifies\r\nthe algorithms and attributes that can be used in TCP-AO's current\r\nmanual keying mechanism and provides the interface for future message\r\nauthentication codes (MACs).
