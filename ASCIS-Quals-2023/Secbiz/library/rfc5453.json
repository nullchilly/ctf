They are required to be unique within a\r\nsubnet.  Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers or\r\nidentifier ranges that have a special meaning attached to them.  An\r\nIPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these ranges\r\nwill encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no\r\ncentralized repository for such reserved identifiers, this document\r\naims to create one.
