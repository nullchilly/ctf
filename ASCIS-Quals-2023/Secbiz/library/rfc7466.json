This\r\nallows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link\r\nquality later improves sufficiently.\r\n\r\nNHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.\r\nHowever, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor\r\nceases being symmetric, including while \"ignored\" (as described\r\nabove), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.\r\nThis may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being\r\npermanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if\r\nthe link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the\r\nacceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.\r\n\r\nThis specification updates RFC 6130 \"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)\r\nNeighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\" and RFC 7181 \"The Optimized\r\nLink State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)\" to permit, as an\r\noption, retaining, but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the\r\nlink quality from the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the\r\nacceptable threshold.  This allows immediate reinstatement of the\r\nsymmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves\r\nsufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more\r\n\"robust\".","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":["MANET","NHDP","OLSRv2","link quality"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6130","RFC7181"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7466","errata_url":null}
