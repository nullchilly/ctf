These protocols require IANA allocations for ICMP type and options, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Payload Protocol Identifiers,\r\nport numbers, and registries for certain formatted message options. This document contains instructions to IANA about which allocations\r\nare required for the Seamoby protocols.  The ICMP subtype extension format for Seamoby has been additionally designed so that it can be\r\nutilized by other experimental mobility protocols, and the SCTP port number is also available for other experimental mobility protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
