A segment can represent any instruction,\r\ntopological or service based. SR segments allow steering a flow\r\nthrough any topological path and service chain while maintaining\r\nper-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an extension to Border Gateway Protocol -\r\nLink State (BGP-LS) for advertisement of BGP Peering Segments along\r\nwith their BGP peering node information so that efficient BGP Egress\r\nPeer Engineering (EPE) policies and strategies can be computed based\r\non Segment Routing.","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":["BGP","BGP-LS","Segment Routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9086","errata_url":null}
