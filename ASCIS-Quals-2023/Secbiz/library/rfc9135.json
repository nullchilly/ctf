This document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging\r\n(IRB) solution based on EVPN to address such requirements.","pub_date":"October 2021","keywords":["IRB","inter-subnet-forwarding","symmetric","asymmetric","mobility"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9135","errata_url":null}
