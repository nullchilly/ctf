      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to
      achieve properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At
      the same time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and
      justify the extra effort of going wireless. This document presents
      wireless use cases (such as aeronautical communications, amusement
      parks, industrial applications, pro audio and video, gaming, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
      control, edge robotics, and emergency vehicles), demanding reliable and
      available behavior.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by
      distributed shapers <xref target="RFC2475" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2475"/>, Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the
      capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data streams for
      real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded
      latency so as to support time-sensitive and mission-critical
      applications on a converged enterprise infrastructure.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">DetNet aims at eliminating packet loss for a committed bandwidth,
      while ensuring a worst-case end-to-end latency, regardless of the
      network conditions and across technologies. By leveraging lower layer
      (Layer 2 (L2) and below) capabilities, Layer 3 (L3) can exploit the use
      of a service layer, steering over multiple technologies and using media
      independent signaling to provide high reliability, precise time
      delivery, and rate enforcement.  DetNet can be seen as
      a set of new Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of worst-case
      delivery. IP networks become more deterministic when the effects of
      statistical multiplexing (jitter and collision loss) are mostly
      eliminated. 
   This requires a tight control of the physical resources
   to maintain the amount of traffic within the physical capabilities of
   the underlying technology, e.g., by using time-shared resources
   (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, by shaping or scheduling
   the packets at every hop, or by using a combination of these 
   techniques.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Key attributes of DetNet include:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1-4">

        network.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be
      guaranteed to be fully deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences,
      including self-induced multipath fading. The term RAW stands for
      "Reliable and Available Wireless" and refers to the mechanisms aimed for
      providing high reliability and availability for IP connectivity over a
      wireless medium. Making wireless reliable and available is even more
      challenging than it is with wires, due to the numerous causes of loss in
      transmission that add up to the congestion losses and due to the delays
      caused by overbooked shared resources.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the
      physical level. While the generic Problem Statement in <xref target="RFC8557" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8557"/> for DetNet applies to the wired as
      well as the wireless medium, the methods to achieve RAW necessarily
      differ from those used to support Time-Sensitive Networking over wires,
      e.g., due to the wireless radio channel specifics.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">So far, open standards for DetNet have prevalently
      been focused on wired media, with Audio Video Bridging (AVB) and
      Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet <xref target="RFC8655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8655"/> at the IETF. However, wires cannot
      be used in several cases, including mobile or rotating devices,
      rehabilitated industrial buildings, wearable or in-body sensory devices,
      vehicle automation, and multiplayer gaming.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">Purpose-built wireless technologies such as <xref target="ISA100" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ISA100"/>, which incorporates IPv6, were developed and deployed

        connected to the edge so that complex computational activities are not
        executed locally at the robots but offloaded to the edge. This brings
        additional flexibility in the type of tasks that the robots perform,
        reduces the costs of robot-manufacturing (due to their lower
        complexity), and enables complex tasks involving coordination among

goods from warehouses to shops.  Multiple robots are simultaneously instructed
to perform individual tasks by moving the robotic intelligence from the robots
to the network's edge. That enables easy synchronization, scalable solution,
and on-demand option to create flexible fleet of robots.

            <t indent="0">This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in common a need for "deterministic flows". "Deterministic" in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data. These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet). For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain. Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path. DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>

            <t indent="0">A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e., "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended operation of these novel service properties.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and packet arrival-time violation detection.</t>
