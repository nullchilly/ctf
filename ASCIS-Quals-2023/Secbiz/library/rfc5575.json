This allows the routing\r\nsystem to propagate information regarding more specific components of\r\nthe traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it defines two applications of that encoding format:\r\none that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic\r\nfiltering, such as what is required in order to mitigate\r\n(distributed) denial-of-service attacks, and a second application to\r\nprovide traffic filtering in the context of a BGP\/MPLS VPN service.\r\n\r\nThe information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol\r\nalgorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such\r\nas inter-provider peering agreements.
