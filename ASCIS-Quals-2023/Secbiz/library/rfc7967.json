This kind of open-loop exchange\r\n(with no response path from the server to the client) may be desired\r\nto minimize resource consumption in constrained systems while\r\nupdating many resources simultaneously or performing high-frequency updates.\r\nCoAP already provides Non-confirmable (NON) messages that are not acknowledged\r\nby the recipient.  However, the request\/response semantics still require the\r\nserver to respond with a status code indicating \"the result of the attempt to      \r\nunderstand and satisfy the request\", per RFC 7252.\r\n\r\nThis specification introduces a CoAP option called 'No-Response'.\r\nUsing this option, the client can explicitly express to the server\r\nits disinterest in all responses against the particular request.\r\nThis option also provides granular control to enable expression of\r\ndisinterest to a particular response class or a combination of\r\nresponse classes.  The server MAY decide to suppress the response by\r\nnot transmitting it back to the client according to the value of the\r\nNo-Response option in the request.  This option may be effective for\r\nboth unicast and multicast requests.  This document also discusses a\r\nfew examples of applications that benefit from this option.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["No-Response"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7967","errata_url":null}
