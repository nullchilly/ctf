The systems that are interconnected may\r\nthemselves be LAN switches.  If, however, they are IP hosts or IP\r\nrouters, certain simplifications to the operation of the VPLS are\r\npossible.  We call this simplified type of VPLS an \"IP-only LAN                     \r\nService\" (IPLS).  In an IPLS, as in a VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in\r\npromiscuous mode, and frames are forwarded based on their destination\r\nMedia Access Control (MAC) addresses.  However, the maintenance of the\r\nMAC forwarding tables is done via signaling, rather than via the MAC\r\naddress learning procedures specified in the IEEE's \"Media Access Control           \r\n(MAC) Bridges\".  This document specifies the protocol extensions and\r\nprocedures for support of the IPLS service.\r\n\r\nThe original intent was to provide an alternate solution to VPLS for\r\nthose Provider Edge (PE) routers that were not capable of learning MAC\r\naddresses through data plane.  This became a non-issue with newer\r\nhardware.  The concepts put forth by this document are still valuable and\r\nare adopted in one form or other by newer work such as Ethernet VPN in\r\nL2VPN working group and possible data center applications.  At this\r\npoint, no further action is planned to update this document and it is\r\npublished simply as a historic record of the ideas.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7436","errata_url":null}
