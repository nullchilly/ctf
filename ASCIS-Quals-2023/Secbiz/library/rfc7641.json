The state of a resource\r\non a CoAP server can change over time.  This document specifies a\r\nsimple protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to\r\n\"observe\" resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource\r\nand keep this representation updated by the server over a period of\r\ntime.  The protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending new\r\nrepresentations to clients and provides eventual consistency between\r\nthe state observed by each client and the actual resource state at\r\nthe server.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["Smart Objects","Internet of Things","IoT","REST"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8323"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7641","errata_url":null}
