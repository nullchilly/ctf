A new frame\r\nformat is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU\r\nsize of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to\r\nthe TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility\r\nwith other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium,\r\nthe dispatching scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is\r\nextended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN.\r\nAdditionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching\r\nframework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks. In\r\nits second part, the document defines stateless and stateful\r\ncompression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links.\r\nStateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields\r\nfor common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide states local\r\nto the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by short local\r\nidentifiers.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\r\nResearch Group (ICNRG).","pub_date":"November 2021","keywords":["Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)","Named Data Networking (NDN)","header compression","fragmentation","6LoWPAN","Internet of Things (IoT)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9139","errata_url":null}
