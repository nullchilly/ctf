The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane\r\nbut may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets\r\nusing a mechanism similar to a \"depth-first search\" for the\r\ndestination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of\r\nfailures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the\r\nDFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC 2460) and\r\nfor \"mesh-under\" Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs),\r\nas specified in RFC 4944.  The design of DFF assumes that the\r\nunderlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been\r\nsuccessfully delivered to the Next Hop or not.  It is applicable for\r\nnetworks with little traffic and is used for unicast transmissions\r\nonly.","pub_date":"June 2013","keywords":["DFF","Depth first forwarding","IPv6","Forwarding plane","Lossy networks","Reliability"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6971","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6971"}
