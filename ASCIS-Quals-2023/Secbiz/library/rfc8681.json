They can\r\nprotect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME\r\nextended to Sliding Window FEC Codes. These Sliding Window FEC Codes\r\nrely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols,\r\ngenerating new repair symbols whenever needed. Compared to block FEC\r\ncodes, these Sliding Window FEC Codes offer key advantages with\r\nreal-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often\r\nproviding improved packet erasure recovery capabilities.","pub_date":"January 2020","keywords":["RLC","FEC","FECFRAME","packet loss recovery","reliability"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8681","errata_url":null}
