This GRE-in-UDP encapsulation\r\nallows the UDP source port field to be used as an entropy field.\r\nThis may be used for load-balancing of GRE traffic in transit\r\nnetworks using existing Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) mechanisms.\r\nThere are two applicability scenarios for GRE-in-UDP with different\r\nrequirements: (1) general Internet and (2) a traffic-managed\r\ncontrolled environment.  The controlled environment has less\r\nrestrictive requirements than the general Internet.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8086","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8086"}
