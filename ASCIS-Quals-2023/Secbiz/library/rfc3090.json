Lewis"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"11","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"DNS Extensions","abstract":" The definition of a secured zone is presented, clarifying and updating sections of RFC 2535.  RFC 2535 defines a zone to be secured based on a per algorithm basis, e.g., a zone can be secured with RSA keys, and not secured with DSA keys.  This document changes this to define a zone to be secured or not secured regardless of the key algorithm used (or not used).  To further simplify the determination of a zone's status, \"experimentally secure\" status is deprecated.
