IS-IS is specified in International Standards Organization\r\n(ISO) 10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol version 4\r\n(IPv4) described in RFC 1195.\r\n\r\nAlthough this document has been written specifically for using the\r\nHashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) construct along with the\r\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of cryptographic hash functions,\r\nthe method described in this document is generic and can be used to\r\nextend IS-IS to support any cryptographic hash function in the\r\nfuture.
