Network operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers\r\n(ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route origin assertions.\r\nISPs can also use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP route.\r\nHowever, ISPs may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the\r\nRPKI data in the form of local filters and additions.  The mechanisms\r\ndescribed in this document provide a simple way to enable INR holders\r\nto establish a local, customized view of the RPKI, overriding global\r\nRPKI repository data as needed.","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["RPKI","Local Trust Anchor","BGPsec"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8416","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8416"}
