Path computation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or\r\nmulti-layer networks is complex and may require special\r\ncomputational components and cooperation between the different\r\nnetwork domains.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation\r\nElement (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.  This\r\ndocument does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all\r\nthe architectural components, but rather it describes a set of\r\nbuilding blocks for the PCE architecture from which solutions may be\r\nconstructed.
