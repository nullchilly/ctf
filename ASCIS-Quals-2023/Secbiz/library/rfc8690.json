RFC 8287 proposes three Target\r\nForwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) Stack sub-TLVs. While RFC 8287\r\ndefines the format and procedure to handle those sub-TLVs, it does\r\nnot sufficiently clarify how the length of the Segment ID sub-TLVs\r\nshould be computed to be included in the Length field of the\r\nsub-TLVs. This ambiguity has resulted in interoperability issues.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 8287 by clarifying the length of each of\r\nthe Segment ID sub-TLVs defined in RFC 8287.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["mpls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8287"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8690","errata_url":null}
