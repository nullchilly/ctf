EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses SHOULD NOT be published in the\r\npublic DNS.  This document specifies an interoperable encoding of\r\nthese address types for use in private DNS namespaces, where the\r\nprivacy concerns can be constrained and mitigated.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":["IEEE","ethernet"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7043","errata_url":null}
