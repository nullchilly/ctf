Some SIP\r\nsessions are established by or related to a non-SIP application.\r\nThis application may have information that needs to be transported\r\nbetween the SIP User Agents during session establishment.  In\r\naddition to interworking with the Integrated Services Digital Network\r\n(ISDN) UUI Service, this extension will also be used for native SIP\r\nendpoints requiring application UUI.
