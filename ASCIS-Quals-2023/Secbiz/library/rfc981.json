The primary route (a    minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which    serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.    This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing    algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider    application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for    improvements are welcomed.
