The PCE\r\nCommunication Protocol (PCECP) is defined to allow communication\r\nbetween Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, as well as between PCEs.\r\nThe PCECP is used to request constrained paths and to supply computed\r\npaths in response.  Generic requirements for the PCECP are set out in\r\n\"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic\r\nRequirements\", RFC 4657.  This document extends those requirements to\r\ncover the use of PCECP in support of inter-AS MPLS TE.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2008","keywords":["PCE","PCECP","inter-AS PCE","inter-provider PCE","inter-AS MPLS-TE","inter-provider MPLS-TE","inter-AS PCECP","inter-provider PCECP","GMPLS path computation","MPLS-TE path computation","path computation element","path computation communication protocol","path computing element","Interas","Interas TE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5376","errata_url":null}
