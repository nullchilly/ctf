This PRNG is a\r\nsmall-sized variant of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG. The main\r\nadvantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state,\r\ncompatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices,\r\nwhile keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a\r\nsignificant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear\r\nCongruential PRNG. However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant\r\nto be used for cryptographic applications.","pub_date":"January 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8682","errata_url":null}
