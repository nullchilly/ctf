Symington"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"10","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"IRTF","abstract":"This document defines an extension block for use with the Delay-\r\nTolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol.  This Previous-Hop\r\nInsertion Block (PHIB) extension block is designed to be inserted by\r\na forwarding node to provide the endpoint identifier (EID) of an\r\nendpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that this EID\r\nmay be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node.  Knowledge of an EID\r\nof an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be\r\nrequired in some circumstances to support certain routing protocols\r\n(e.g., flood routing).  If this EID cannot be provided by the\r\nconvergence layer or other means, the PHIB defines the mechanism\r\nwhereby the EID can be provided with the bundle.  Each PHIB is always\r\nremoved from the bundle by the receiving node so that its presence\r\nwithin the bundle is limited to exactly one hop.  This document\r\ndefines the format and processing of this PHIB.  This document is a\r\nproduct of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been\r\nreviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC\r\nwere raised.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["DTN","Delay-Tolerant Networking","Distruption-Tolerant Networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6259","errata_url":null}
