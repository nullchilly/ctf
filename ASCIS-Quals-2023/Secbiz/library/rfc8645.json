This amount is called\r\nthe \"key lifetime\".  This specification describes a variety of\r\nmethods for increasing the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides\r\ntwo types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and block\r\nciphers that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM,\r\nCBC, CFB, and OMAC.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\r\nin the IRTF.","pub_date":"August 2019","keywords":["re-keying","key","key lifetime","encryption mode","mode of operation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8645","errata_url":null}
