The payload format is designed to be able to\r\ninteroperate with existing VMR-WB transport formats on non-IP\r\nnetworks.  A media type registration is included for VMR-WB RTP\r\npayload format.\r\n\r\nVMR-WB is a variable-rate multimode wideband speech codec that has a\r\nnumber of operating modes, one of which is interoperable with AMR-WB\r\n(i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates.  Therefore, provisions\r\nhave been made in this document to facilitate and simplify data packet\r\nexchange between VMR-WB and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no\r\ntranscoding function involved.
