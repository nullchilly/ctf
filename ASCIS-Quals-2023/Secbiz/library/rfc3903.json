The first application of this extension is for the publication of presence information. \r\n\r\n The mechanism described in this document can be extended to support publication of any event state for which there exists an appropriate event package.  It is not intended to be a general-purpose mechanism for transport of arbitrary data, as there are better-suited mechanisms for this purpose.
