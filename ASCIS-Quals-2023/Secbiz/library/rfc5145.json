An\r\nappropriate migration strategy will be selected based on various\r\nfactors including the service provider's network deployment plan,\r\ncustomer demand, and operational policy.\r\n\r\nThis document presents several migration models and strategies for\r\nmigrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS.  In the course of migration, MPLS-TE\r\nand GMPLS devices, or networks, may coexist that may require\r\ninterworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols.  Aspects of the\r\nrequired interworking are discussed as it will influence the choice\r\nof a migration strategy.  This framework document provides a migration\r\ntoolkit to aid the operator in selection of an appropriate strategy.\r\n\r\nThis framework document also lists a set of solutions that may aid in\r\ninterworking, and highlights a set of potential issues.
