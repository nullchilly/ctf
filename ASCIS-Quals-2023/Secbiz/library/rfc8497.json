As networks grow and become\r\ninterconnected, including connection via transit networks, it becomes\r\nimpractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between\r\nuser agents and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signaling end to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol that can be\r\nused to mark signaling as being of interest to logging.  Such marking\r\nwill typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by\r\nthe network operator and is not used in normal user agent signaling.\r\nOperators of all networks on the signaling path can agree to carry\r\nsuch marking end to end, including the originating and terminating\r\nSIP user agents, even if a session originates and terminates in\r\ndifferent networks.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["SIP","logme","troubleshooting","debug","debugging","logging"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8497","errata_url":null}
