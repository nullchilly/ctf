It is well known that as we approach\r\nthe speed of light, time slows down.  Logically, it is reasonable to\r\nassume that as we go faster than the speed of light, time will\r\nreverse.  The major consequence of this for Internet protocols is\r\nthat packets will arrive before they are sent.  This will have a\r\nmajor impact on the way we design Internet protocols.  This paper\r\noutlines some of the issues and suggests some directions for\r\nadditional analysis of these issues.","pub_date":"1 April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6921","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6921"}
