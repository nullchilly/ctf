A single subnet prefix is sufficient to\r\nsupport multiple physical links.  There is no need to allocate\r\nsubnet numbers to the different networks, simplifying management.\r\nBridging some types of media requires network-layer support,\r\nhowever.  This document describes these cases and specifies the\r\nIP-layer support that enables bridging under these circumstances.
