During handover, there is a period during\r\nwhich the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of\r\nlink switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This \"handover\r\nlatency\" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely\r\nmovement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and Binding\r\nUpdate, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over\r\nIP (VoIP).  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to\r\nnon-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This\r\ndocument specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to\r\nMobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the\r\nlink switching latency.
