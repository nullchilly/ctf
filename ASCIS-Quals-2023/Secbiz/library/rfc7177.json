TRILL uses Intermediate System to Intermediate\r\nSystem (IS-IS) routing.  This document specifies the establishment,\r\nreporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacencies between TRILL\r\nswitches, also known as RBridges (Routing Bridges).  It also concerns\r\nfour other link-local aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB)\r\nselection, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode\r\ncreation, and BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) session\r\nbootstrapping in connection with adjacency.  State diagrams are\r\nincluded where appropriate.  This document obsoletes RFC 6327 and\r\nupdates RFC 6325.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["RBridge","TRILL","Adjacency","BFD","p2p","point-to-point"],"obsoletes":["RFC6327"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6325"],"updated_by":["RFC7780","RFC8139","RFC8249","RFC8377","RFC8564"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7177","errata_url":null}
