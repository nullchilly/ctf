When implemented\r\nin only the Collecting Process or Exporting Process, then normal IPFIX\r\nbehavior will be seen without all of the additional benefits.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"March 2012","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6526","errata_url":null}
