In particular, media delivery is an area that needs\r\nattention.  One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring\r\nthe media delivery performance by looping media back to the\r\ntransmitter.  This is typically referred to as \"active monitoring\"\r\nof services.  Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the\r\nquality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP, real-time text, or\r\nVideo over IP service.  Today, in networks that deliver real-time\r\nmedia, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge,\r\nadministrators are left without the necessary tools to actively\r\nmonitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service.\r\nThe extension defined herein adds new Session Description Protocol\r\n(SDP) media types and attributes that enable establishment of media\r\nsessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter.  Such\r\nmedia sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools\r\nby providing the means for measurement of more advanced VoIP,\r\nreal-time text, and Video over IP performance metrics.
