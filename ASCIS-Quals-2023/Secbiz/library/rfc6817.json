LEDBAT uses\r\nchanges in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the\r\nflow itself induces in the network.  LEDBAT is designed for use by\r\nbackground bulk-transfer applications to be no more aggressive than\r\nstandard TCP congestion control (as specified in RFC 5681) and to\r\nyield in the presence of competing flows, thus limiting interference\r\nwith the network performance of competing flows.  This document defines \r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2012","keywords":["Congestion control","delay-based","scavenger","P2P"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6817","errata_url":null}
