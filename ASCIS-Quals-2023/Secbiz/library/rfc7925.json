The lack of\r\ncommunication security is a common vulnerability in IoT products that\r\ncan easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely\r\ndeployed Internet security protocols.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["Internet of Things Security","TLS Profile","DTLS Profile","IoT Security","DTLS over SMS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7925","errata_url":null}
