An ECN-capable receiver will feed this\r\ninformation back to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a\r\nway that it can only feed back one congestion signal per Round-Trip\r\nTime (RTT).  In contrast, ECN for other transport protocols, such as\r\nRTP\/UDP and SCTP, is specified with more accurate ECN feedback.\r\nRecent new TCP mechanisms (like Congestion Exposure (ConEx) or Data\r\nCenter TCP (DCTCP)) need more accurate ECN feedback in the case where\r\nmore than one marking is received in one RTT.  This document\r\nspecifies requirements for an update to the TCP protocol to provide\r\nmore accurate ECN feedback.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["congestion control","TCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7560","errata_url":null}
