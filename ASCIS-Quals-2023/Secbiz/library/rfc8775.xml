      <t pn="section-abstract-1">On a multi-access network, one of the PIM-SM (PIM Sparse Mode)
      routers is elected as a
      Designated Router. One of the responsibilities of the Designated Router
      is to track local multicast listeners and forward data to these
      listeners if the group is operating in PIM-SM. This
      document specifies a modification to the PIM-SM protocol that
      allows more than one of the PIM-SM routers to take on this responsibility
      so that the forwarding load can be distributed among multiple routers.

      data-plane forwarding leads to several issues.  One of the issues is
      that the
      aggregated bandwidth will be limited to what R1 can handle with
      regards to capacity of incoming links, the interface on the LAN,
      and total forwarding capacity. It is very common that a LAN consists of
      switches that run IGMP/MLD or PIM snooping <xref target="RFC4541" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4541"/>. 
      This allows the forwarding of multicast packets to be
      restricted only to segments leading to receivers that have indicated
      their interest in multicast groups using either IGMP or MLD.  The
      emergence of the switched Ethernet allows the aggregated bandwidth to
      exceed, sometimes by a large number, that of a single link.  For
      example, let us modify <xref target="LAN-REC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> and
      introduce an Ethernet switch in <xref target="LAN-SWITCH" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>.

      router (R1, R2, and R3) and the switch have enough forwarding capacity
      to handle hundreds of gigabits of data.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-8">Let us further assume that each of the hosts requests 500 Mbps of
      unique multicast data. This totals to 1.5 Gbps of data, which is less
      than what each switch or the combined uplink bandwidth across the
      routers can handle, even under failure of a single router.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-9"> On the other hand, the link between R1 and switch, via port gi1, can

      PIM DR elected using the procedure defined by <xref target="RFC7761" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7761"/>),
      at least 500 Mbps worth of data will be lost because the only link that
      can be used to draw the traffic from the routers to the switch is via
      gi1. In other words, the entire network's throughput is limited by the
      single connection between the PIM DR and the switch (or LAN, as in
      <xref target="LAN-REC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>).
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-10">Another important issue is related to failover.  If R1 is the only
      forwarder on a shared LAN, when R1
      goes out of service, multicast forwarding for the entire LAN has
      to be rebuilt by the newly elected PIM DR.  However, if there were a
      way that allowed multiple routers to forward to the LAN for
      different groups, failure of one of the routers would only lead to
      disruption to a subset of the flows, therefore improving the overall
      resilience of the network.

            The modulo hash algorithm has poor failover characteristics when
            a shared LAN has more than two GDRs. In the
            case of more than two GDRs on a LAN, when one GDR fails, all
            of the groups may be reassigned to a different GDR, even if
	    they were not assigned to the failed GDR. However, many
	    deployments use only two routers on a shared LAN for redundancy
	    purposes. Future work may define new hash algorithms where only
	    groups assigned to the failed GDR get reassigned.

              <t>This memo describes the recommendations for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping switches.  These are based on best current practices for IGMPv2, with further considerations for IGMPv3- and MLDv2-snooping.  Additional areas of relevance, such as link layer topology changes and Ethernet-specific encapsulation issues, are also considered.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are designated as source-specific multicast (SSM) destination addresses and are reserved for use by source-specific applications and protocols.  For IP version 6 (IPv6), the address prefix FF3x::/32 is reserved for source-specific multicast use.  This document defines an extension to the Internet network service that applies to datagrams sent to SSM addresses and defines the host and router requirements to support this extension.
