While\r\nMIPv6 (and FMIPv6 as well) requires the participation of the mobile\r\nnode in the mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6;\r\nRFC 5213) provides IP mobility to nodes that either have or do not\r\nhave MIPv6 functionality without such involvement.  Nevertheless, the\r\nbasic performance of PMIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet\r\nloss is considered no different from that of MIPv6.\r\n\r\nWhen the fast handover is considered in such an environment, several\r\nmodifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based\r\nmobility management.  This document specifies the usage of fast\r\nhandovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6; RFC 5568) when Proxy Mobile IPv6\r\nis used as the mobility management protocol.  Necessary extensions\r\nare specified for FMIPv6 to support the scenario when the mobile node\r\ndoes not have IP mobility functionality and hence is not involved\r\nwith either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.
