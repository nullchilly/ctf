This document updates those\r\nreference models to show detailed reference points for these\r\ninterfaces, along with further clarification of the functional\r\narchitecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) \/ International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\r\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\r\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge\r\n(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities\r\nof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for \r\ninformational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5921"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6215","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6215"}
