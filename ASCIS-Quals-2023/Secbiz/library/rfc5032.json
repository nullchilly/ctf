IMAP\r\nSEARCH returns messages whose internal date is within or outside a\r\nspecified interval.  The mechanism described here, OLDER and YOUNGER,\r\ndiffers from BEFORE and SINCE in that the client specifies an\r\ninterval, rather than a date.  WITHIN is useful for persistent\r\nsearches where either the device does not have the capacity to\r\nperform the search at regular intervals or the network is of limited\r\nbandwidth and thus there is a desire to reduce network traffic from\r\nsending repeated requests and redundant responses.
