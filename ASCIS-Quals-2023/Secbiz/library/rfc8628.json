It enables OAuth clients on such\r\ndevices (like smart TVs, media consoles, digital picture frames, and\r\nprinters) to obtain user authorization to access protected resources\r\nby using a user agent on a separate device.","pub_date":"August 2019","keywords":["Security Area","OAuth","Security","Authorization","Smart Objects","IoT","Internet of Things","Internet of Things Security","OAuth for Constrained Devices","OAuth IoT Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8628","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8628"}
