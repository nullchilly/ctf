However, it is also required to provide proper Quality of Service (QoS) forwarding treatment to the mobile node's packet stream at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP services can be supported over Mobile IP.  This document describes requirements for an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
