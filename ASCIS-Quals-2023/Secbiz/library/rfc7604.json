Each technique includes a description of how it would be\r\nused, the security implications of using it, and any other deployment\r\nconsiderations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT\r\ntraversal techniques relate to firewalls and how each technique can\r\nbe applied in different use cases.  These findings were used when\r\nselecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0, which is specified in a\r\nseparate document.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["RTP","Real-time Transport Protocol","Real-time","Firewall","UDP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7604","errata_url":null}
