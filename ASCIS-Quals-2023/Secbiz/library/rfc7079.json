In most of these encapsulations, use\r\nof the Pseudowire (PW) Control Word is required.  However, there are\r\nseveral encapsulations for which the Control Word is optional, and\r\nthis optionality has been seen in practice to possibly introduce\r\ninteroperability concerns between multiple implementations of those\r\nencapsulations.  This survey of the Pseudowire \/ Virtual Circuit\r\nConnectivity Verification (VCCV) user community was conducted to\r\ndetermine implementation trends and the possibility of always\r\nmandating the Control Word.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["Control Word (CW)","Control Channel (CC)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7079","errata_url":null}
