The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are systematic codes, where\r\na number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols\r\nand sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source\r\nsymbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The\r\nRaptor and RaptorQ codes offer close to optimal protection against\r\narbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.  Six FEC\r\nSchemes are defined: two for the protection of arbitrary packet flows,\r\ntwo that are optimized for small source blocks, and two for the\r\nprotection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.\r\nRepair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g., UDP)\r\nor using RTP.
