The document does not describe\r\na mechanism whereby filtering of event notification information can\r\nbe achieved.  Filtering is a mechanism for defining the preferred\r\nnotification information to be delivered and for specifying triggers\r\nthat cause that information to be delivered.  In order to enable\r\nthis, a format is needed to enable the subscriber to describe the\r\nstate changes of a resource that cause notifications to be sent to it\r\nand what those notifications are to contain.  This document presents\r\na format in the form of an XML document.
