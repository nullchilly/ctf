These protocols are primarily\r\nfocused on X.509v3 public-key certificates.  However, it is sometimes\r\ndesirable to manage certificates in alternative formats as well.  This\r\ndocument specifies how such certificates may be requested using the\r\nCertificate Request Message Format (CRMF) syntax that is used by\r\nseveral different protocols.  It also explains how alternative\r\ncertificate formats may be incorporated into such popular protocols as\r\nPKIX Certificate Management Protocol (PKIX-CMP) and Certificate\r\nManagement Messages over CMS (CMC).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2005","keywords":["X.509v3","public-key certificates","crmf","certificate request message format","pkix certificate management protocol","pkix-cmp","certificate management messages over cms","cmc"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4212","errata_url":null}
