Such deployment\r\nmay require the configuration of a potentially large number of TE\r\nLSPs (on the order of the square of the number of LSRs).  This document\r\nspecifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for\r\nIntermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest\r\nPath First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set\r\nof LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such\r\nmesh of TE LSPs.
