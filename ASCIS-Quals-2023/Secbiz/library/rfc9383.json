SPAKE2+ is\r\nan augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party has knowledge of the\r\npassword. This method is simple to implement, compatible with any\r\nprime-order group, and computationally efficient.\r\n\r\nThis document was produced outside of the IETF and IRTF and\r\nrepresents the opinions of the authors.
