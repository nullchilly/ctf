{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC1095","title":" Common Management Information Services and Protocol over TCP\/IP (CMOT) ","authors":["U.S. Warrier","L. Besaw"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"67","pub_status":"UNKNOWN","status":"UNKNOWN","source":"Legacy","abstract":" This memo defines a network management architecture that uses the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) Common Management Information Services\/Common Management Information Protocol (CMIS\/CMIP) in a TCP\/IP environment.  This architecture provides a means by which control and monitoring information can be exchanged between a manager and a remote network element.  In particular, this memo defines the means for implementing the Draft International Standard (DIS) version of CMIS\/CMIP on top of Internet transport protocols for the purpose of carrying management information defined in the Internet-standard management information base.  DIS CMIS\/CMIP is suitable for deployment in TCP\/IP networks while CMIS\/CMIP moves toward becoming an International Standard.  Together with the relevant ISO standards and the companion RFCs that describe the initial structure of management information and management information base, these documents provide the basis for a comprehensive architecture and system for managing TCP\/IP- based internets, and in particular the Internet.
