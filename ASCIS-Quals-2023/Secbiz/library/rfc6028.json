The first extension allows implementing\r\nsource routing in HIP.  That is, a node sending a HIP packet can define a set\r\nof nodes that the HIP packet should traverse.  The second extension allows a\r\nHIP packet to carry and record the list of nodes that forwarded it.  \r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["source routing","route recording","overlay network"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6028","errata_url":null}
