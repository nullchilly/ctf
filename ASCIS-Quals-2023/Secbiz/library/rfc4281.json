A receiving agent thus needs to examine\r\nthe details of such media content to determine if the specific\r\nelements can be rendered given an available set of codecs.\r\nEspecially when the end system has limited resources, or the\r\nconnection to the end system has limited bandwidth, it would be\r\nhelpful to know from the Content-Type alone if the content can be\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nThis document adds a new parameter, \"codecs\", to various\r\ntype\/subtype combinations to allow for unambiguous specification of\r\nthe codecs indicated by the media formats contained within.\r\n\r\nBy labeling content with the specific codecs indicated to render the\r\ncontained media, receiving systems can determine if the codecs are\r\nsupported by the end system, and if not, can take appropriate action\r\n(such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the\r\nsituation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and\r\ninstalling the required codecs, further inspection to determine if\r\nit will be sufficient to support a subset of the indicated codecs,\r\netc.)  [STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2005","keywords":["codec","container","audio","video","3gpp","3gpp2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6381"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4281","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4281"}
