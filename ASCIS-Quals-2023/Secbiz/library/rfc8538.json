This document updates RFC 4724 by defining an\r\nextension that permits the Graceful Restart procedures to be\r\nperformed when the BGP speaker receives a BGP NOTIFICATION message or\r\nthe Hold Time expires.  This document also defines a new subcode for\r\nBGP Cease NOTIFICATION messages; this new subcode requests a full\r\nsession restart instead of a Graceful Restart.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["IDR","BGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4724"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8538","errata_url":null}
