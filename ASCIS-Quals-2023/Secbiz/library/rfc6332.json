Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP\r\nreceivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right\r\nafter they join the session.  Thus, they often experience a random\r\nacquisition delay.  An RTP receiver can use one or more different\r\napproaches to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various\r\nfactors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.\r\nFurthermore, in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple\r\nmulticast join (in other cases, it is compelled to do so).  For\r\nquality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes, it is\r\nimportant to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers\r\nabout their acquisition and presentation experiences.  This document\r\naddresses this issue by defining a new report block type, called the\r\nMulticast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework of RTP\r\nControl Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs) (RFC 3611).  This\r\ndocument also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report\r\nblock type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).
