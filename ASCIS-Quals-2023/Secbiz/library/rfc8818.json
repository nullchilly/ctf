A network may be configured with distributed mobility\r\nanchoring functions for both network-based or host-based mobility\r\nsupport, depending on the network's needs. In a distributed mobility\r\nanchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session\r\nswitching of an IP prefix anchor. To start a new flow or to handle a\r\nflow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a\r\nnew network, the flow can be started or restarted using an IP address\r\nconfigured from the new IP prefix anchored to the new network. If the\r\nflow needs to survive the change of network, there are solutions that\r\ncan be used to enable IP address mobility. This document describes\r\ndifferent anchoring approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs,\r\nand how this IP address mobility is handled by the network.","pub_date":"October 2020","keywords":["anchor","address continuity","reachability","continuity","PMIPv6","MIPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8818","errata_url":null}
