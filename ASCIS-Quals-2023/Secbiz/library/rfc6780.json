In this context, the object is used to\r\nassociate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  This\r\nobject also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate\r\nRSVP state.  This document defines how the ASSOCIATION object\r\ncan be more generally applied.  This document also defines\r\nExtended ASSOCIATION objects that, in particular, can be used in\r\nthe context of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  This document updates\r\nRFC 2205, RFC 3209, and RFC 3473.  It also generalizes the definition of the\r\nAssociation ID field defined in RFC 4872.
