This omission can lead to\r\nunpredictable server processing of queries and client processing of\r\nresponses.  This unpredictability can be greatly reduced if clients\r\ncan provide servers with their preferences for managing large\r\nresponses.  This document describes RDAP query extensions that allow\r\nclients to specify their preferences for sorting and paging result\r\nsets.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["RDAP","Sorting","Paging"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8977","errata_url":null}
