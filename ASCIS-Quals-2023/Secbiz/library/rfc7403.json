A mechanism for\r\nmedia-loopback calls has also been defined separately, which enables\r\ntest calls to be generated that result in media being looped back to\r\nthe originator.  This document describes a means of performing\r\nhop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback\r\nmechanism to test the media path when SIP sessions go through\r\nmedia-relaying back-to-back user agents (B2BUAs).","pub_date":"November 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7403","errata_url":null}
