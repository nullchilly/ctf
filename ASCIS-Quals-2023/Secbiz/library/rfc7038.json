This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR (MANET Designated\r\nRouter) in a single-hop broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET\r\nin which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike\r\nan OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost\r\nassociated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration\r\nrecommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in\r\nsingle-hop broadcast networks.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":["routing","mobile ad hoc network","MANET designated router","wireless","point-to-multipoint interface"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5614"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7038","errata_url":null}
