The\r\ncanonical solution for IPv6 is Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), a\r\nsolution that is non-trivial to deploy.  This document proposes a\r\nlight-weight alternative and complement to SEND based on filtering in\r\nthe layer-2 network fabric, using a variety of filtering criteria,\r\nincluding, for example, SEND status.
