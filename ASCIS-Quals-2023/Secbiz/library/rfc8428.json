Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation\r\n(JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), Extensible\r\nMarkup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which\r\nshare the common SenML data model.  A simple sensor, such as a\r\ntemperature sensor, could use one of these media types in protocols\r\nsuch as HTTP or the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to\r\ntransport the measurements of the sensor or to be configured.","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["IoT","data model"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9100"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8428","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8428"}
