When\r\nsending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to\r\nwait for the server to send a command continuation request between\r\nsending the octet count and the string data.  This document specifies\r\nan alternate form of literal that does not require this network round\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-.\r\nLITERAL+ allows the alternate form of literals in all IMAP commands.\r\nLITERAL- is the same as LITERAL+, but it disallows the alternate form\r\nof literals unless they are 4096 bytes or less.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2088.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["IMAP","LITERAL+","LITERAL-","APPENDLIMIT"],"obsoletes":["RFC2088"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7888","errata_url":null}
