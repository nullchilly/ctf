TSVCIS is a scalable narrowband voice coder supporting\r\nvarying encoder data rates and fallbacks.  It is implemented as an\r\naugmentation to the Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction Enhanced\r\n(MELPe) speech coder by conveying additional speech coder parameters\r\nto enhance voice quality.  TSVCIS augmented speech data is processed\r\nin conjunction with its temporally matched Mixed Excitation Linear\r\nPrediction (MELP) 2400 speech data.  The RTP packetization of TSVCIS\r\nand MELPe speech coder data is described in detail.","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["MELP","MELPe","TSVCIS","NRLVDR","Naval Research Laboratory","NRL","NATO","TSVWG","Department of Defense","DoD","NSA","MIL-STD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8817","errata_url":null}
