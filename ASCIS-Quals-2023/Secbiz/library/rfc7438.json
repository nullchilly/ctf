In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP\r\nmulticast tree \"seamlessly\" into an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched\r\nPath (MP-LSP) when it enters the MPLS domain, and then to convert it\r\nback to an IP multicast tree when it exits the MPLS domain.  Previous\r\ndocuments specify procedures that allow certain kinds of IP multicast\r\ntrees (either Source-Specific Multicast trees or Bidirectional\r\nMulticast trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched\r\nPath (MP-LSP).  However, the previous documents do not specify\r\nprocedures for attaching IP Any-Source Multicast trees to MP-LSPs,\r\nnor do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple IP multicast\r\ntrees onto a single MP-LSP.  This document specifies the procedures\r\nto support these functions.  It does so by defining \"wildcard\"\r\nencodings that make it possible to specify, when setting up an MP-\r\nLSP, that a set of IP multicast trees, or a shared IP multicast tree,\r\nshould be attached to that MP-LSP.  Support for non-bidirectional IP\r\nAny-Source Multicast trees is subject to certain applicability\r\nrestrictions that are discussed in this document.  This document\r\nupdates RFCs 6826 and 7246.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":["mpls","multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6826","RFC7246"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7438","errata_url":null}
