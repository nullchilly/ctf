A Standards Track document supersedes an\r\ninformational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is\r\nto be followed when the two documents are in conflict.  This document\r\nlinks the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic\r\nis clearer.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;\r\nit is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["IPv6","\/127","point-to-point address","inter-router links"],"obsoletes":["RFC3627"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6164"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6547","errata_url":null}
