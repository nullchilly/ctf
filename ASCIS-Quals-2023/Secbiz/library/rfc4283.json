Mobile IPv6\r\nnodes need the capability to identify themselves using an identity\r\nother than the default home IP address.  Some examples of identifiers\r\ninclude Network Access Identifier (NAI), Fully Qualified Domain Name\r\n(FQDN), International Mobile Station Identifier (IMSI), and Mobile\r\nSubscriber Number (MSISDN).  This document defines a new mobility\r\noption that can be used by Mobile IPv6 entities to identify\r\nthemselves in messages containing a mobility header.
