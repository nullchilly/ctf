      <t pn="section-1-1">The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) <xref target="RFC8711" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8711"/> is
        responsible for arranging the selection and operation of the IETF
	plenary meeting venue.  The purpose of this document is to
        guide the IASA in their selection of regions, cities, 
        facilities, and hotels.  The IASA should apply this guidance at
        different points in the process in an attempt to faithfully
        meet the requirements of the IETF community.  We specify a set
        of general criteria for venue selection and several requirements for
	transparency and community consultation.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">It remains the responsibility of the IASA to apply their best judgment. The
IASA accepts input and feedback during the consultation process and later (for
instance, when there are changes in the situation at a chosen location).
The community is encouraged to provide direct feedback about the IASA's
performance to the IETF Administration LLC, the Nominations Committee (NOMCOM),
or the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). Any reviews of IASA
decisions remain subject to the provisions of <xref target="RFC8711" section="4.7" sectionFormat="of" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711#section-4.7" derivedContent="RFC8711"/> (BCP 101).

              case, means that all forms of communication are allowed.
              This includes, but is not limited to, access to corporate networks
              via encrypted VPNs from the meeting Facility and Hotels, including
              Overflow Hotels. We also need open network access available at

              participation. Beyond this, we are the first users of
              our own technology. Any filtering may cause a problem
              with that technology development.  In some cases,

              budget alternatives for food and lodging, and that minimize
              travel segments from major airports to the Venue. Within reason,

          <abstract>
            <t>New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested individuals.  IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to hold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas.  Such side meetings, which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and have no official status, are often half-jokingly referred to as "bar                 BOF" sessions to acknowledge that some of them may eventually lead to a proposal for an official IETF BOF ("birds of a feather" session) on a given topic.</t>
            <t>During recent IETF meetings, many such "bar BOF" get-togethers have been organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings.</t>
            <t>This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently discuss and develop ideas for new IETF work.  It encourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding them in much less formal settings and to also consider alternative means to develop their ideas.  This document also recommends that the community abandon the term "bar BOF" and instead use other terms such as "side meeting", in order to stress the unofficial nature of these get-togethers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
