While existing ad-hoc\r\nmechanisms allow an operator to send follow-up queries when it is\r\nnecessary to debug such a configuration, the only completely reliable\r\nway to obtain the identity of the name server that responded is to\r\nhave the name server include this information in the response itself.\r\nThis note defines a protocol extension to support this functionality.
