Profiles defining\r\nsupport for context replication may use the mechanism described herein\r\nto establish a new context based on another already existing context.\r\nContext replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of the\r\ncontext establishment procedure.  It may be especially useful for the\r\ncompression of multiple short-lived flows that may be occurring\r\nsimultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as short-lived TCP flows.
