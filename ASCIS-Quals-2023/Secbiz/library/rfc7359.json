That is,\r\ntraffic meant to be transferred over an encrypted and integrity-\r\nprotected VPN tunnel may leak out of such a tunnel and be sent in the\r\nclear on the local network towards the final destination.  This\r\ndocument discusses some scenarios in which such VPN tunnel traffic\r\nleakages may occur as a result of employing IPv6-unaware VPN\r\nsoftware.  Additionally, this document offers possible mitigations\r\nfor this issue.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7359","errata_url":null}
