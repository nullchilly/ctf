The claims in a CWT are encoded in\r\nthe Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), and CBOR Object\r\nSigning and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application-layer\r\nsecurity protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted\r\nabout a subject and is represented as a name\/value pair consisting of\r\na claim name and a claim value.  CWT is derived from JSON Web Token\r\n(JWT) but uses CBOR rather than JSON.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["JSON Web Token","JWT","Claims","Concise Binary Object Representation","CBOR","CBOR Object Signing and Encryption","COSE","OAuth","ACE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8392","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8392"}
