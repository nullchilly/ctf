Since the\r\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications such\r\nas Segment Routing (SR) Policy and Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) that\r\nalso make use of the link attribute advertisements have been defined.\r\n In cases where multiple applications wish to make use of these link\r\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support\r\napplication-specific values for a given attribute, nor do they\r\nsupport indication of which applications are using the advertised\r\nvalue for a given link.  This document introduces link attribute\r\nadvertisements in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 that address both of these\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 8920.","pub_date":"October 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC8920"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9492","errata_url":null}
