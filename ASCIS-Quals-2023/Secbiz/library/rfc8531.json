It\r\nprovides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs\r\nfor such protocols.  The model presented here can be extended to\r\ninclude technology-specific details.  This guarantees uniformity in\r\nthe management of OAM protocols and provides support for nested OAM\r\nworkflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different levels through\r\na unified interface).\r\n\r\nThe YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network\r\nManagement Datastore Architecture.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8531","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8531"}
