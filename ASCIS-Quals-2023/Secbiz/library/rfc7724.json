That mechanism\r\nis limited to queries for individual bindings.  In some situations,\r\nindividual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.\r\nIn addition, continuous update of an external requestor with\r\nLeasequery data is sometimes desired.  This document expands on the\r\nDHCPv4 Leasequery protocol, and allows for active transfer of near\r\nreal-time DHCPv4 binding information data via TCP.
