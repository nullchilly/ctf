Route\r\ncomputation has been controlled by relatively static policies that\r\ndefine link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies.\r\nRequirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program\r\nrouting systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center\r\nnetworking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic\r\nsteering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat\r\nresponsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating\r\npolicy-based decision-making from the router itself.  These\r\nrequirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic\r\npaths and extracting network topology information, traffic\r\nstatistics, and other network analytics from routing systems.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the\r\nRouting System (I2RS).","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7920","errata_url":null}
