Protocols and configurations push\r\ndata into the RIB, and the RIB manager installs state into the\r\nhardware for packet forwarding.  This document specifies an\r\ninformation model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data\r\nmodel.  The IETF's I2RS WG used this document to design the I2RS RIB\r\ndata model.  This document is being published to record the higher-\r\nlevel information model decisions for RIBs so that other developers\r\nof RIBs may benefit from the design concepts.","pub_date":"September 2018","keywords":["RIB","info model"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8430","errata_url":null}
