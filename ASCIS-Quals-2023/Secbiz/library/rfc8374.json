This document also presents brief summaries of\r\nthe arguments that aided the decision process.  Where appropriate,\r\nthis document also provides brief notes on design decisions that\r\nchanged as the specification was reviewed and updated by the IETF\r\nSIDR Working Group and that resulted in RFC 8205.  These notes\r\nhighlight the differences and provide pointers to details and\r\nrationale regarding those design changes.","pub_date":"April 2018","keywords":["Internet Routing Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8374","errata_url":null}
