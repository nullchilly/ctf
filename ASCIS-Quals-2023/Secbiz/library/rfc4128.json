Two such\r\nmodels, the Maximum Allocation and the Russian Dolls, are described\r\ntherein.  This document complements RFC 3564 by presenting the\r\nresults of a performance evaluation of these two models under\r\nvarious operational conditions: normal load, overload, preemption\r\nfully or partially enabled, pure blocking, or complete sharing.
