No objections to its\r\npublication as an RFC were raised.\r\n\r\nThis document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using\r\nHistory of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a variant of the\r\nepidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that\r\noperates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimize\r\nresource usage while still attempting to achieve the \\%best-case\r\nrouting capabilities of epidemic routing.  It is intended for use in\r\nsparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully\r\nconnected path between the source and destination exists at any time,\r\nrendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages\r\nbetween hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where there\r\nis a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and\r\nthe capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred\r\nto as delay and disruption tolerant).  The document presents an\r\narchitectural overview followed by the protocol specification.\r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["[--------]","DTN","Routing","PRoPHET"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6693","errata_url":null}
