Such tagging is typically used to control the\r\nscope of redistribution of routes within a provider's network and to\r\nits peers and customers.  With the advent of large-scale BGP data\r\ncollection (and associated research), it has become clear that the\r\ninformation carried in such communities is essential for a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the global routing system.  This memo defines\r\nstandard (outbound) communities and their encodings for export to BGP\r\nroute collectors.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"January 2006","keywords":["border gateway protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0114"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4384","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4384"}
