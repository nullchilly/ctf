MPLS-TP extends MPLS\r\ntechnologies and introduces new Operations, Administration, and\r\nMaintenance (OAM) capabilities, a transport-oriented path protection\r\nmechanism, and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by\r\nnetwork management systems.  This document addresses the security\r\naspects relevant in the context of MPLS-TP specifically.  It describes\r\npotential security threats as well as mitigation procedures related\r\nto MPLS-TP networks and to MPLS-TP interconnection to other MPLS and\r\nGMPLS networks.  This document is built on RFC 5920\r\n(\"Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks\") by providing\r\nadditional security considerations that are applicable to the MPLS-TP\r\nextensions.  All the security considerations from RFC 5920 are\r\nassumed to apply.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) \/ International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\r\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\r\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)\r\narchitectures to support the capabilities and functionality of a\r\npacket transport network.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":["threats","mitigation","defensive techniques"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6941","errata_url":null}
