Specifically, this document defines a \"LOCATOR_SET\"\r\nparameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers\r\nabout alternate addresses at which it may be reached.  This document\r\nalso defines how the parameter can be used to preserve communications\r\nacross a change to the IP address used by one or both peer hosts.\r\nThe same LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host\r\nmultihoming (as specified in RFC 8047).
