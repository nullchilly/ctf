Major extensions introduced\r\nin NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory\r\nDelegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1\r\nhas no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is\r\nconsidered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates\r\nnor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to\r\nNFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is\r\npreferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be\r\nused simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and\r\nserver.
