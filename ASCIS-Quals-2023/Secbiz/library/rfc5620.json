The RFC Editor model presented in\r\nthis document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into\r\nfour functions: The RFC Series Editor, the Independent Submission\r\nEditor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  It also\r\nintroduces the RFC Series Advisory Group and an (optional)\r\nIndependent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  The model outlined\r\nhere is intended to increase flexibility and operational support\r\noptions, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and\r\nensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC\r\nquality and timely processing, ensuring document accessibility,\r\nreducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.
