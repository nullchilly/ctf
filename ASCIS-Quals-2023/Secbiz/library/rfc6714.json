The extension allows\r\nmiddleboxes to anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for\r\nmiddleboxes to modify the MSRP messages; thus, it also enables secure\r\nend-to-end MSRP communication in networks where such middleboxes are\r\ndeployed.  This document also defines a Session Description Protocol\r\n(SDP) attribute, 'msrp-cema', that MSRP endpoints use to indicate\r\nsupport of the CEMA extension.
