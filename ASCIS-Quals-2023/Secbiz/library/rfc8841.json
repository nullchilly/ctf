This specification also specifies how to use the\r\nnew proto values with the SDP offer\/answer mechanism for negotiating\r\nSCTP-over-DTLS associations.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["SCTP","SDP","DTLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8841","errata_url":null}
