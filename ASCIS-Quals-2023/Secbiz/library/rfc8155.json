These are usually under the administrative control of\r\nthe application or TURN service provider, and not the enterprise,\r\nISP, or the network in which the client is located.  Enterprises and\r\nISPs wishing to provide their own TURN servers need auto-discovery\r\nmechanisms that a TURN client could use with minimal or no\r\nconfiguration.  This document describes three such mechanisms for\r\nTURN server discovery.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5766 to relax the requirement for mutual\r\nauthentication in certain cases.","pub_date":"April 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5766"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8155","errata_url":null}
