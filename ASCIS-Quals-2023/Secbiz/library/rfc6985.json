Tests with a constant packet size\r\nreveal device capabilities but differ significantly from the\r\nconditions encountered in operational deployment, so additional tests\r\nare sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes, or \"IMIX\"\r\n(\"Internet Mix\").  The mixture of sizes a networking device will\r\nencounter is highly variable and depends on many factors.  An IMIX\r\nsuited for one networking device and deployment will not be\r\nappropriate for another.  However, the mix of sizes may be known, and\r\nthe tester may be asked to augment the fixed-size tests.  To address\r\nthis need and the perpetual goal of specifying repeatable test\r\nconditions, this document defines a way to specify the exact\r\nrepeating sequence of packet sizes from the usual set of fixed sizes\r\nand from other forms of mixed-size specification.","pub_date":"July 2013","keywords":["Traffic","Pattern","Benchmarking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6985","errata_url":null}
