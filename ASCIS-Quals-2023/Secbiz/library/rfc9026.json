The fast failover is enabled by using\r\n\"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for Multipoint Networks\"\r\n(RFC 8562)  and the new BGP Attribute, BFD Discriminator.  Also, this\r\ndocument introduces a new BGP Community, Standby PE, extending BGP\r\nMulticast VPN (MVPN) routing so that a C-multicast route can be\r\nadvertised toward a Standby Upstream PE.","pub_date":"April 2021","keywords":["BFD","P2MP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9026","errata_url":null}
