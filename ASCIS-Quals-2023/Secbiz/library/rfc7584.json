This means that B2BUAs often act on the\r\nmedia path leading to separate media legs that the B2BUA correlates\r\nand bridges together.  When acting on the media path, B2BUAs are\r\nlikely to receive Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) packets\r\nas part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) processing.\r\n\r\nThis document defines behavior for a B2BUA performing ICE processing.\r\nThe goal of this document is to ensure that B2BUAs properly handle\r\nSIP messages that carry ICE semantics in Session Description Protocol\r\n(SDP) and STUN messages received as part of the ICE procedures for\r\nNAT and Firewall traversal of multimedia sessions.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7584","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7584"}
