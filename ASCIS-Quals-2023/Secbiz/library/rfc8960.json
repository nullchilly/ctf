The MPLS base YANG data model serves as a base framework for\r\nconfiguring and managing an MPLS switching subsystem on an\r\nMPLS-enabled router.  It is expected that other MPLS YANG data models\r\n(e.g., MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) static, LDP, or RSVP-TE YANG\r\ndata models) will augment the MPLS base YANG data model.","pub_date":"December 2020","keywords":["MPLS YANG Data Model","MPLS Model","MPLS RIB","MPLS Routing Information Base"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8960","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8960"}
