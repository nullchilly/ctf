This document describes such a method for\r\nflows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and\r\nsimple as possible while minimizing the number of changes needed to\r\nexisting RTP applications. This document also specifies how to apply\r\nthe method for the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA)\r\ncongestion control algorithm and provides suggestions on how to apply\r\nit to other congestion control algorithms.","pub_date":"January 2020","keywords":["tcp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8699","errata_url":null}
