Similar to how an XML Schema defines the\r\nstructure and semantics of an XML Document, this document defines how\r\nEBML Schemas are created to convey the semantics of an EBML Document.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["cellar","binary","storage","xml","matroska","webm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8794","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8794"}
