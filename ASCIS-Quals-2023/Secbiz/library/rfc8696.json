The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport\r\nand key agreement algorithms that could be broken by the invention of\r\nsuch a quantum computer.  By storing communications that are\r\nprotected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the\r\nfuture when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available.  Once\r\nquantum-secure key management algorithms are available, the CMS will\r\nbe extended to support the new algorithms if the existing syntax does\r\nnot accommodate them.  This document describes a mechanism to protect\r\ntoday's communication from the future invention of a large-scale\r\nquantum computer by mixing the output of key transport and key\r\nagreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["quantum-resistant"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8696","errata_url":null}
