These networks are\r\nbased on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the\r\nradio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile\r\nCommunications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System\r\n(UMTS)\/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and\r\napplicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those\r\ntransition scenarios.  In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE)\r\nconnects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6\/IPv4\r\ntransition mechanisms are needed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2005","keywords":["internet protocol","gprs","general packet radio service","global system for mobile communications","gsm","universal mobile telecommunications system","umts","wideband code division multiple access","wcdma"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4215","errata_url":null}
