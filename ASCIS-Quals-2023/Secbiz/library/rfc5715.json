It also provides a survey of the currently proposed\r\nmechanisms that may be used to prevent or to suppress the formation\r\nof micro-loops when an IP or MPLS network undergoes topology change\r\ndue to failure, repair, or management action.  When sufficiently fast\r\nconvergence is not available and the topology is susceptible to\r\nmicro-loops, use of one or more of these mechanisms may be desirable.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"January 2010","keywords":["IP Fast Reroute","MPLS Fast Reroute","Routing Convergence","Network Topology","PLSN","not-via","Incremental Cost","Packet Marking","ordered fib","ofib"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5715","errata_url":null}
