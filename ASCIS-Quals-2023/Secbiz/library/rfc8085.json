This\r\ndocument provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of\r\napplications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion\r\ncontrol guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also\r\nprovides guidance on other topics, including message sizes,\r\nreliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit\r\nCongestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points\r\n(DSCPs), and ports.\r\n\r\nBecause congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the\r\nInternet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as\r\nan Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion\r\ncollapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent\r\ntraffic.  They may also need to implement additional mechanisms,\r\ndepending on how they use UDP.\r\n\r\nSome guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols\r\n(e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels),\r\nespecially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast\r\nUDP usage.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["UDP","guidelines"],"obsoletes":["RFC5405"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8899"],"see_also":["BCP0145"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8085","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8085"}
