Joseph"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"50","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"This document defines OSPF-xTE, an experimental traffic engineering\r\n(TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF.  OSPF-xTE\r\ndefines new TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs) to disseminate TE\r\nmetrics within an autonomous System (AS), which may consist of multiple\r\nareas.  When an AS consists of TE and non-TE nodes, OSPF-xTE ensures\r\nthat non-TE nodes in the AS are unaffected by the TE LSAs.  OSPF-xTE\r\ngenerates a stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), distinct from\r\nthe native OSPF LSDB, for computation of TE circuit paths.  OSPF-xTE is\r\nversatile and extendible to non-packet networks such as Synchronous\r\nOptical Network (SONET) \/ Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and\r\noptical networks.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","ospf-te","link state advertisement","lsa"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4973","errata_url":null}
