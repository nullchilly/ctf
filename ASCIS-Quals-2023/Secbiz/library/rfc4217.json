This document is intended\r\nto provide TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that provided for\r\nSMTP in RFC 2487, \"SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over\r\nTransport Layer Security\", and HTTP in RFC 2817, \"Upgrading to TLS Within\r\nHTTP\/1.1.\".\r\n\r\nThis specification is in accordance with RFC 959, \"File Transfer\r\nProtocol\".
