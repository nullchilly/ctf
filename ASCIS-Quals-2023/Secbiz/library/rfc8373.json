This is especially important for\r\nemergency calls, because it allows for a call to be handled by a call\r\ntaker capable of communicating with the user or for a translator or\r\nrelay operator to be bridged into the call during setup.  However,\r\nthis also applies to non-emergency calls (for example, calls to a\r\ncompany call center).\r\n\r\nThis document describes the need as well as a solution that uses new\r\nSDP media attributes.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["SDP","language","human language","SIP","SLIM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8865"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8373","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8373"}
