As we\r\nhave added extensions, such as Mailbox Referrals, that have required\r\nspecialized lists we have had to expand the number of list commands,\r\nsince each extension must add its function to both LIST and LSUB, and\r\nthese commands are not, as they are defined, extensible.  If we've\r\nneeded the extensions to work together, we've had to add a set of\r\ncommands to mix the different options, the set increasing in size\r\nwith each new extension.  This document describes an extension to the\r\nbase LIST command that will allow these additions to be done with\r\nmutually compatible options to the LIST command, avoiding the\r\nexponential increase in specialized list commands.
