      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">  This memo describes an RTP payload format for the Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
  specification, which was published as both ITU-T Recommendation H.266 and ISO/IEC
  International Standard 23090-3.  VVC was developed by the Joint Video Experts 
  Team (JVET). The RTP payload
format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction
Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation
of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload format has wide
applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and
high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other applications.</t>

their respective predecessors.  With respect to design
philosophy, security, congestion control, and overall implementation

memo, we provide a very brief overview of those features of VVC
that are, in some form, addressed by the payload format specified
herein.  Implementers have to read, understand, and apply the ITU-T/ISO/IEC specifications pertaining to VVC to arrive at
interoperable, well-performing implementations.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">Conceptually, both VVC and HEVC include a Video Coding Layer (VCL),
which is often used to refer to the coding-tool features, and a NAL, which 
is often used to refer to the systems and transport interface aspects of the codecs.</t>

the coding-tool set of HEVC, which is well known in the community.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.1-2">Similar to earlier hybrid-video-coding-based standards, including
HEVC, the following basic video coding design is employed by VVC.
A prediction signal is first formed by either intra- or motion-
compensated prediction, and the residual (the difference between the
original and the prediction) is then coded.  The gains in coding
efficiency are achieved by redesigning and improving almost all parts
of the codec over earlier designs.  In addition, VVC includes several
tools to make the implementation on parallel architectures easier.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.1-3">Finally, VVC includes temporal, spatial, and SNR scalability, as well 
as multiview coding support.</t>

            <dt pn="section-1.1.1-4.1">Coding blocks and transform structure</dt>
            <dd pn="section-1.1.1-4.2">Among major coding-tool differences between HEVC and VVC, one of
the important improvements is the more flexible coding tree structure
in VVC, i.e., multi-type tree.  In addition to quadtree, binary and
ternary trees are also supported, which contributes significant
improvement in coding efficiency.  Moreover, the maximum size of a 
coding tree unit (CTU) is increased from 64x64 to 128x128.  To
improve the coding efficiency of chroma signal, luma-chroma-separated
trees at CTU level may be employed for intra slices.  The square transforms 
in HEVC are extended to non-square transforms for rectangular blocks 
resulting from binary and ternary tree splits. Besides, VVC supports 
multiple transform sets (MTSs), including DCT-2, DST-7, and DCT-8, as well 
as the non-separable secondary transform.  The transforms used in VVC 
can have different sizes with support for larger transform sizes.  For DCT-2, 
the transform sizes range from 2x2 to 64x64, and for DST-7 and DCT-8, the
transform sizes range from 4x4 to 32x32.  In addition, VVC also
support sub-block transform for both intra- and inter-coded blocks.
For intra-coded blocks, intra sub-partitioning (ISP) may be used to
allow sub-block-based intra prediction and transform.  For inter blocks, sub-block transform may be used assuming that only a part of
an inter block has non-zero transform coefficients.</dd>
            <dt pn="section-1.1.1-4.3">Entropy coding</dt>
            <dd pn="section-1.1.1-4.4">Similar to HEVC, VVC uses a single entropy-coding engine, which is
based on context adaptive binary arithmetic coding <xref target="CABAC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CABAC"/>
but with the support of multi-window sizes.  The window sizes can be
initialized differently for different context models.  Due to such a
design, it has more efficient adaptation speed and better coding
efficiency.  A joint chroma residual coding scheme is applied to
further exploit the correlation between the residuals of two color
components.  In VVC, different residual coding schemes are applied
for regular transform coefficients and residual samples generated
using transform-skip mode.</dd>
            <dt pn="section-1.1.1-4.5">In-loop filtering</dt>
            <dd pn="section-1.1.1-4.6">VVC has more feature support in loop filters than HEVC.  The
deblocking filter in VVC is similar to HEVC but operates at a
smaller grid.  After deblocking and sample adaptive offset (SAO), an
adaptive loop filter (ALF) may be used.  As a Wiener filter, ALF
reduces distortion of decoded pictures.  Besides, VVC introduces a
new module called luma mapping with chroma scaling 
to fully utilize the dynamic range of signal so that rate-distortion
performance of both Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) content is improved.</dd>
            <dt pn="section-1.1.1-4.7">Motion prediction and coding</dt>
            <dd pn="section-1.1.1-4.8">Compared to HEVC, VVC introduces several improvements in this area.
First, there is the adaptive motion vector resolution (AMVR), which
can save bit cost for motion vectors by adaptively signaling motion
vector resolution.  Then, the affine motion compensation is included
to capture complicated motion-like zooming and rotation.  Meanwhile,
prediction refinement with the optical flow (PROF) with affine mode
is further deployed to mimic affine motion at the pixel level.
Thirdly, the decoder-side motion vector refinement (DMVR) is a method
to derive the motion vector at the decoder side based on block matching so that fewer bits may be spent
on motion vectors.  Bidirectional optical flow (BDOF) is a similar
method to PROF.  BDOF adds a sample-wise offset at the 4x4 sub-block level that is derived with equations based on gradients of the prediction samples and a motion difference relative to coding-unit (CU) motion vectors.  Furthermore, merge with motion vector difference (MMVD)
is a special mode that further signals a limited set of motion
vector differences on top of merge mode.  In addition to MMVD, there
are another three types of special merge modes, i.e., sub-block
merge, triangle, and combined intra/inter prediction (CIIP).  The sub-block merge list includes one candidate of sub-block temporal motion
vector prediction (SbTMVP) and up to four candidates of affine motion
vectors.  Triangle is based on triangular block motion compensation.
CIIP combines intra and inter predictions with weighting.
Adaptive weighting may be employed with a block-level tool called 
bi-prediction with CU-based weighting (BCW), which provides more 
flexibility than in HEVC.</dd>
            <dt pn="section-1.1.1-4.9">Intra prediction and intra coding</dt>
            <dd pn="section-1.1.1-4.10">To capture the diversified local image texture directions with finer
granularity, VVC supports 65 angular directions instead of 33
directions in HEVC.  The intra mode coding is based on a 6-most-probable-modes scheme, and the 6 most probable modes are derived using
the neighboring intra prediction directions.  In addition, to deal
with the different distributions of intra prediction angles for
different block aspect ratios, a wide-angle-intra-prediction (WAIP)
scheme is applied in VVC by including intra prediction angles
beyond those present in HEVC.  Unlike HEVC, which only allows using
the most adjacent line of reference samples for intra prediction,
VVC also allows using two further reference lines, known as
multi-reference-line (MRL) intra prediction.  The additional
reference lines can be only used for the 6 most probable intra prediction
modes.  To capture the strong correlation between different color
components, in VVC, a cross-component linear mode (CCLM) is
utilized, which assumes a linear relationship between the luma sample values and their associated chroma samples.  For intra prediction,
VVC also applies a position-dependent prediction combination (PDPC)
for refining the prediction samples closer to the intra prediction
block boundary.  Matrix-based intra prediction (MIP) modes are also
used in VVC, which generates an up to 8x8 intra prediction block
using a weighted sum of downsampled neighboring reference samples,
and the weights are hard-coded constants.</dd>

from HEVC and AVC.  These include the NAL-unit-based syntax
structure, the hierarchical syntax and data unit structure, the
supplemental enhancement information (SEI) message mechanism, and the
video buffering model based on the hypothetical reference decoder

the scalable extension of HEVC, known as SHVC.  The hierarchical syntax

For streaming, the requirement of constant parameters pertains through splicing. Such information includes profile, level, and sub-profile information to determine a maximum capability interop point that is guaranteed to never be exceeded, even if splicing of video sequences occurs within a session. It further includes constraint fields (most of which are flags), which can optionally be set to indicate that the video bitstream will be constrained in the use of certain features, as indicated by the values of those fields. With this, a bitstream can be labeled as not using certain tools, which allows, among other things, for resource allocation in a decoder implementation.</dd>

The VPS provides a "big picture" of a scalable sequence, including what types of operation points are provided; the profile, tier, and level of the operation points; and some other high-level properties of the bitstream that can be used as the basis for session negotiation and content selection, etc. One VPS may be referenced by one or more sequence parameter sets.</dd>

            <dd pn="section-1.1.2-3.6">The sequence parameter set (SPS) contains syntax elements pertaining to a coded layer video sequence (CLVS), which is a group of pictures belonging to the same layer, starting with a random access point, and followed by pictures that may depend on each other until the next random access point picture. In MPEG-2, the equivalent of a CVS was a group of pictures (GOP), which normally started with an I frame and was followed by P and B frames. While more complex in its options of random access points, VVC retains this basic concept. One remarkable difference of VVC is that a CLVS may start with a Gradual Decoding Refresh (GDR) picture without requiring presence of traditional random access points in the bitstream, such as instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) or clean random access (CRA) pictures. In many TV-like applications, a CVS contains a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds of video. In video conferencing (without switching Multipoint Control Units (MCUs) involved), a CVS can be as long in duration as the whole session.</dd>

The PPS contains information that is likely to stay constant from picture to picture, at least for pictures for a certain type, whereas the APS contains information, such as adaptive loop filter coefficients, that are likely to change from picture to picture or even within a picture. A single APS is referenced by all slices of the same picture if that APS contains information about luma mapping with chroma scaling (LMCS) or a scaling list. Different APSs containing ALF parameters can be referenced by slices of the same picture.</dd>

            <dd pn="section-1.1.2-3.10">A picture header (PH) contains information that is common to all slices that belong to the same picture. Being able to send that information as a separate NAL unit when pictures are split into several slices allows for saving bitrate, compared to repeating the same information in all slices. However, there might be scenarios where low-bitrate video is transmitted using a single slice per picture. Having a separate NAL unit to convey that information incurs in an overhead for such scenarios. For such scenarios, the picture header syntax structure is directly included in the slice header, instead of its own NAL unit. The mode of the picture header syntax structure being included in its own NAL unit or not can only be switched on/off for an entire CLVS and can only be switched off when, in the entire CLVS, each picture contains only one slice.</dd>

It is carried in the profile_tier_level structure and hence is (potentially) present in the DCI, VPS, and SPS. External registration bodies can register a T.35 codepoint with ITU-T registration authorities and associate with their registration a description of bitstream restrictions beyond the profiles defined by ITU-T and ISO/IEC. This would allow encoder manufacturers to label the bitstreams generated by their encoder as complying with such sub-profile. It is expected that upstream standardization organizations (such as Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)), as well as walled-garden video services, will take advantage of this labeled system. In contrast to "normal" profiles, it is expected that sub-profiles may indicate encoder choices traditionally left open in the (decoder-centric) video coding specifications, such as GOP structures, minimum/maximum Quantizer Parameter (QP) values, and the mandatory use of certain tools or SEI messages.</dd>

They were included in reaction to a perceived market need to label a bitstream as not exercising a certain tool that has become commercially unviable.</dd>

            <dd pn="section-1.1.2-3.18">VVC includes support of temporal scalability, by the inclusion of the signaling of TemporalId in the NAL unit header, the restriction that pictures of a particular temporal sublayer cannot be used for inter prediction reference by pictures of a lower temporal sublayer, the sub-bitstream extraction process, and the requirement that each sub-bitstream extraction output be a conforming bitstream. Media-Aware Network Elements (MANEs) can utilize the TemporalId in the NAL unit header for stream adaptation purposes based on temporal scalability.</dd>

            <dd pn="section-1.1.2-3.20">In AVC and HEVC, the spatial resolution of pictures cannot change unless a new sequence using a new SPS starts, with an intra random access point (IRAP) picture. VVC enables picture resolution change within a sequence at a position without encoding an IRAP picture, which is always intra coded. This feature is sometimes referred to as reference picture resampling (RPR), as the feature needs resampling of a reference picture used for inter prediction when that reference picture has a different resolution than the current picture being decoded. RPR allows resolution change without the need of coding an IRAP picture and hence avoids a momentary bit rate spike caused by an IRAP picture in streaming or video conferencing scenarios, e.g., to cope with network condition changes.  RPR can also be used in application scenarios wherein zooming of the entire video region or some region of interest is needed.</dd>

Scalable video coding is widely considered to have technical benefits and enrich services for various video applications. Until recently, however, the functionality has not been included in the first version of specifications of the video codecs. In VVC, however, all those forms of scalability are supported in the first version of VVC natively through the signaling of the nuh_layer_id in the NAL unit header, the VPS that associates layers with the given nuh_layer_id to each other, reference picture selection, reference picture resampling for spatial scalability, and a number of other mechanisms not relevant for this memo.</t>

The inter-layer prediction is employed in a scalable system to improve the coding efficiency of the enhancement layers. In addition to the spatial and temporal motion-compensated predictions that are available in a single-layer codec, the inter-layer prediction in VVC uses the possibly resampled video data of the reconstructed reference picture from a reference layer to predict the current enhancement layer. The resampling process for inter-layer prediction, when used, is performed at the block level, reusing the existing interpolation process for motion compensation in single-layer coding.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-1">VVC inherited the concept of tiles and wavefront parallel processing (WPP) from HEVC, with some minor to moderate differences. The basic concept of slices was kept in VVC but designed in an essentially different form. VVC is the first video coding standard that includes subpictures as a feature, which provides the same functionality as HEVC motion-constrained tile sets (MCTSs) but designed differently to have better coding efficiency and to be friendlier for usage in application systems. More details of these differences are described below.</t>

            <dd pn="section-1.1.3-2.2">Same as in HEVC, a picture can be split into tile rows and tile columns in VVC, in-picture prediction across tile boundaries is disallowed, etc. However, the syntax for signaling of tile partitioning has been simplified by using a unified syntax design for both the uniform and the non-uniform mode. In addition, signaling of entry point offsets for tiles in the slice header is optional in VVC, while it is mandatory in HEVC. The WPP design in VVC has two differences compared to HEVC: i) the CTU row delay is reduced from two CTUs to one CTU, and ii) signaling of entry point offsets for WPP in the slice header is optional in VVC while it is mandatory in HEVC.</dd>

              <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-2.4.1">In VVC, the conventional slices based on CTUs (as in HEVC) or macroblocks (as in AVC) have been removed. The main reasoning behind this architectural change is as follows. The advances in video coding since 2003 (the publication year of AVC v1) have been such that slice-based error concealment has become practically impossible due to the ever-increasing number and efficiency of in-picture and inter-picture prediction mechanisms. An error-concealed picture is the decoding result of a transmitted coded picture for which there is some data loss (e.g., loss of some slices) of the coded picture or a reference picture, as at least some part of the coded picture is not error-free (e.g., that reference picture was an error-concealed picture). For example, when one of the multiple slices of a picture is lost, it may be error-concealed using an interpolation of the neighboring slices. While advanced video coding prediction mechanisms provide significantly higher coding efficiency, they also make it harder for machines to estimate the quality of an error-concealed picture, which was already a hard problem with the use of simpler prediction mechanisms. Advanced in-picture prediction mechanisms also cause the coding efficiency loss due to splitting a picture into multiple slices to be more significant. Furthermore, network conditions become significantly better while, at the same time, techniques for dealing with packet losses have become significantly improved. As a result, very few implementations have recently used slices for maximum-transmission-unit-size matching. Instead, substantially all applications where low-delay error resilience is required (e.g., video telephony and video conferencing) rely on system/transport-level error resilience (e.g., retransmission or forward error correction) and/or picture-based error resilience tools (e.g., feedback-based error resilience, insertion of IRAPs, scalability with a higher protection level of the base layer, and so on). Considering all the above, nowadays, it is very rare that a picture that cannot be correctly decoded is passed to the decoder, and when such a rare case occurs, the system can afford to wait for an error-free picture to be decoded and available for display without resulting in frequent and long periods of picture freezing seen by end users.</t>
              <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-2.4.2">Slices in VVC have two modes: rectangular slices and raster-scan slices. The rectangular slice, as indicated by its name, covers a rectangular region of the picture. Typically, a rectangular slice consists of several complete tiles. However, it is also possible that a rectangular slice is a subset of a tile and consists of one or more consecutive, complete CTU rows within a tile. A raster-scan slice consists of one or more complete tiles in a tile raster-scan order; hence, the region covered by raster-scan slices need not but could have a non-rectangular shape, but it may also happen to have the shape of a rectangle. The concept of slices in VVC is therefore strongly linked to or based on tiles instead of CTUs (as in HEVC) or macroblocks (as in AVC).</t>

              <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-2.6.1">VVC is the first video coding standard that includes the support of subpictures as a feature. Each subpicture consists of one or more complete rectangular slices that collectively cover a rectangular region of the picture. A subpicture may be either specified to be extractable (i.e., coded independently of other subpictures of the same picture and of earlier pictures in decoding order) or not extractable. Regardless of whether a subpicture is extractable or not, the encoder can control whether in-loop filtering (including deblocking, SAO, and ALF) is applied across the subpicture boundaries individually for each subpicture.</t>
              <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-2.6.2">Functionally, subpictures are similar to the motion-constrained tile sets (MCTSs) in HEVC. They both allow independent coding and extraction of a rectangular subset of a sequence of coded pictures for use cases like viewport-dependent 360-degree video streaming optimization and region of interest (ROI) applications.</t>
              <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1.3-2.6.3">There are several important design differences between subpictures and MCTSs. First, the subpictures featured in VVC allow motion vectors of a coding block to point outside of the subpicture, even when the subpicture is extractable by applying sample padding at the subpicture boundaries, in this case, similarly as at picture boundaries. Second, additional changes were introduced for the selection and derivation of motion vectors in the merge mode and in the decoder-side motion vector refinement process of VVC. This allows higher coding efficiency compared to the non-normative motion constraints applied at the encoder-side for MCTSs. Third, rewriting of slice headers (SHs) (and PH NAL units, when present) is not needed when extracting one or more extractable subpictures from a sequence of pictures to create a sub-bitstream that is a conforming bitstream. In sub-bitstream extractions based on HEVC MCTSs, rewriting of SHs is needed. Note that, in both HEVC MCTSs extraction and VVC subpictures extraction, rewriting of SPSs and PPSs is needed. However, typically, there are only a few parameter sets in a bitstream, whereas each picture has at least one slice; therefore, rewriting of SHs can be a significant burden for application systems. Fourth, slices of different subpictures within a picture are allowed to have different NAL unit types. Fifth, VVC specifies HRD and level definitions for subpicture sequences, thus the conformance of the sub-bitstream of each extractable subpicture sequence can be ensured by encoders.</t>

or gateways in that a MANE has to be aware of the signaling (e.g.,
to learn about the payload type mappings of the media streams),
and in that it has to be trusted when working with Secure RTP
(SRTP).  The advantage of using MANEs is that they allow packets
to be dropped according to the needs of the media coding.  For
example, if a MANE has to drop packets due to congestion on a
certain link, it can identify and remove those packets whose
elimination produces the least adverse effect on the user
experience.  After dropping packets, MANEs must rewrite RTCP
packets to match the changes to the RTP stream, as specified in

not forward VCL NAL units of higher sublayers or some
SEI NAL units when there is congestion in the network. In another example, the first intra-coded picture of a pre-encoded clip is transmitted in advance to ensure that it is readily available in the receiver, and when transmitting the first intra-coded picture, the originator 
does not exactly know how many NAL units will be encoded
before the first intra-coded picture of the pre-encoded
clip follows in decoding order. Thus, the values of 
AbsDon for the NAL units of the first intra-coded picture

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">The general concept behind de-packetization is to get the NAL units
out of the RTP packets in an RTP stream and pass them to the decoder in the NAL
unit decoding order.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-2">The de-packetization process is implementation dependent.  Therefore,
the following description should be seen as an example of a suitable
implementation.  Other schemes may be used as well, as long as the
output for the same input is the same as the process described below.
The output is the same when the set of output NAL units and their
order are both identical.  Optimizations relative to the described
algorithms are possible.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-3">All normal RTP mechanisms related to buffer management apply.  In
particular, duplicated or outdated RTP packets (as indicated by the
RTP sequence number and the RTP timestamp) are removed.  To
determine the exact time for decoding, factors, such as a possible
intentional delay to allow for proper inter-stream synchronization,
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be factored in.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-4">NAL units with NAL unit type values in the range of 0 to 27,
inclusive, may be passed to the decoder.  NAL-unit-like structures
with NAL unit type values in the range of 28 to 31, inclusive, <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be passed to the decoder.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-5">The receiver includes a receiver buffer, which is used to compensate
for transmission delay jitter within individual RTP streams and to reorder NAL units from transmission order to the NAL unit decoding order.  In this section, the
receiver operation is described under the assumption that there is no
transmission delay jitter within an RTP stream. To make a difference from a practical receiver buffer that is also used for compensation of transmission delay jitter, the
receiver buffer is hereafter called the de-packetization buffer in
this section.  Receivers should also prepare for transmission delay
jitter, that is, either reserve separate buffers for transmission
delay jitter buffering and de-packetization buffering or use a
receiver buffer for both transmission delay jitter and de-
packetization. Moreover, receivers should take transmission delay
jitter into account in the buffering operation, e.g., by additional
initial buffering before starting of decoding and playback.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-6">The de-packetization process extracts the NAL units from the RTP packets in an RTP stream as follows.  When an RTP packet carries a single NAL unit packet, the payload of the RTP packet is extracted as a single NAL unit, excluding the DONL field, i.e., third and fourth bytes, when sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0.  When an RTP packet carries an aggregation packet, several NAL units are extracted from the payload of the RTP packet.  In this case, each NAL unit corresponds to the part of the payload of each aggregation unit that follows the NALU size field, as described in <xref target="aps" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3.2"/>.  When an RTP packet carries a Fragmentation Unit (FU), all RTP packets from the first FU (with the S field equal to 1) of the fragmented NAL unit up to the last FU (with the E field equal to 1) of the fragmented NAL unit are collected.  The NAL unit is extracted from these RTP packets by concatenating all FU payloads in the same order as the corresponding RTP packets and appending the NAL unit header with the fields F, LayerId, and TID set to equal the values of the fields F, LayerId, and TID in the payload header of the FUs, respectively, and with the NAL unit type set equal to the value of the field FuType in the FU header of the FUs, as described in <xref target="funits" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.3.3"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-7">When sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0, the de-packetization buffer size is zero bytes, and the NAL units carried in the single RTP stream are directly passed to the decoder in their transmission order, which is identical to their decoding order.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-8">When sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0, the process described in the remainder of this section
applies.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-9">There are two buffering states in the receiver: initial buffering and
buffering while playing.  Initial buffering starts when the reception
is initialized.  After initial buffering, decoding and playback are
started, and the buffering-while-playing mode is used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-10">Regardless of the buffering state, the receiver stores incoming NAL units in reception order into the de-packetization buffer.  NAL units carried in RTP packets are stored in the de-packetization
buffer individually, and the value of AbsDon is calculated and stored for each NAL unit.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-11">Initial buffering lasts until the difference between the greatest and smallest AbsDon values of the NAL units in the de-packetization buffer is greater than or equal to the value of sprop-max-don-diff.</t>

payload format itself and to one feature of <xref target="VVC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VVC"/> that may pose a
particularly serious security risk if implemented naively.  The
payload format, in isolation, does not form a complete system.
Implementers are advised to read and understand relevant security-related documents, especially those pertaining to RTP (see the
Security Considerations section in <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/>) and the security of
the call-control stack chosen (that may make use of the media type
registration of this memo).  Implementers should also consider known
security vulnerabilities of video coding and decoding implementations
in general and avoid those.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-2">Within this RTP payload format, and with the exception of the user
data SEI message as described below, no security threats other than
those common to RTP payload formats are known.  In other words,
neither the various media-plane-based mechanisms nor the signaling
part of this memo seem to pose a security risk beyond those common
to all RTP-based systems.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-3">RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
specification <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/> and in any applicable RTP profile, such as
RTP/AVP <xref target="RFC3551" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3551"/>, RTP/AVPF <xref target="RFC4585" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4585"/>, RTP/SAVP <xref target="RFC3711" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3711"/>,

Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" <xref target="RFC7202" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7202"/>
discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic security
goals, like confidentiality, integrity, and source authenticity for RTP
in general.  This responsibility lays on anyone using RTP in an
application.  They can find guidance on available security mechanisms
and important considerations in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions"
<xref target="RFC7201" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7201"/>. The rest of this section discusses the security
impacting properties of the payload format itself.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-4">Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied
end to end, any encryption needs to be performed after compression.
A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
into the bitstream that are complex to decode and that cause the
receiver to be overloaded.  <xref target="VVC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VVC"/> is particularly vulnerable to such
attacks, as it is extremely simple to generate datagrams containing
NAL units that affect the decoding process of many future NAL units.
Therefore, the usage of data origin authentication and data integrity 
protection of at least the RTP packet is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> but NOT <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>
based on the thoughts of <xref target="RFC7202" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7202"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-5">Like HEVC <xref target="RFC7798" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7798"/>, <xref target="VVC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VVC"/> includes a user data Supplemental
Enhancement Information (SEI) message.  This SEI message allows
inclusion of an arbitrary bitstring into the video bitstream.  Such a
bitstring could include JavaScript, machine code, and other active
content.  <xref target="VVC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VVC"/> leaves the handling of this SEI message to the
receiving system.  In order to avoid harmful side effects of
the user data SEI message, decoder implementations cannot naively
trust its content.  For example, it would be a bad and insecure
implementation practice to forward any JavaScript a decoder
implementation detects to a web browser.  The safest way to deal with
user data SEI messages is to simply discard them, but that can have
negative side effects on the quality of experience by the user.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-6">End-to-end security with authentication, integrity, or
confidentiality protection will prevent a MANE from performing media-
aware operations other than discarding complete packets.  In the case
of confidentiality protection, it will even be prevented from
discarding packets in a media-aware way.  To be allowed to perform
such operations, a MANE is required to be a trusted entity that is
included in the security context establishment. This on-path inclusion of the MANE forgoes end-to-end security guarantees for the end points.</t>

<xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/> and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP <xref target="RFC3551" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3551"/> or AVPF <xref target="RFC4585" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4585"/>.
If best-effort service is being used, an additional requirement is
that users of this payload format <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> monitor packet loss to ensure
that the packet loss rate is within an acceptable range.  Packet loss
is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network path
and experiencing the same network conditions would achieve an
average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not
less than all RTP streams combined are achieved.  This condition can
be satisfied by implementing congestion-control mechanisms to adapt
the transmission rate, by implementing the number of layers subscribed for a layered
multicast session, or by arranging for a receiver to leave the
session if the loss rate is unacceptably high.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">The bitrate adaptation necessary for obeying the congestion control
principle is easily achievable when real-time encoding is used, for
example, by adequately tuning the quantization parameter.
However, when pre-encoded content is being transmitted, bandwidth
adaptation requires the pre-coded bitstream to be tailored for such
adaptivity.  The key mechanisms available in <xref target="VVC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VVC"/> are temporal
scalability and spatial/SNR scalability.  A media sender can remove
NAL units belonging to higher temporal sublayers (i.e., those NAL
units with a high value of TID) or higher spatio-SNR layers until the sending bitrate drops to
an acceptable range.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-3">The mechanisms mentioned above generally work within a defined profile and level;
therefore no renegotiation of the channel is required.  Only
when non-downgradable parameters (such as profile) are required to be
changed does it become necessary to terminate and restart the RTP
stream(s).  This may be accomplished by using different RTP payload
types.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">MANEs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> remove certain unusable packets from the RTP stream when
that RTP stream was damaged due to previous packet losses.  This can
help reduce the network load in certain special cases.  For example,
MANEs can remove those FUs where the leading FUs belonging to the
same NAL unit have been lost or those dependent slice segments when
the leading slice segments belonging to the same slice have been
lost, because the trailing FUs or dependent slice segments are
meaningless to most decoders.  MANE can also remove higher temporal
scalable layers if the outbound transmission (from the MANE's
viewpoint) experiences congestion.</t>

              <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.  Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used.  The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

              <t indent="0">Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single stream as well as multiple RTP streams.  When multiple RTP streams are used, a single transport or multiple transports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.</t>

              <t indent="0">This memorandum defines the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) version 2.0, which obsoletes RTSP version 1.0 defined in RFC 2326.</t>
              <t indent="0">RTSP is an application-layer protocol for the setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and video. Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions; provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP, and TCP; and provide a means for choosing delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).</t>
