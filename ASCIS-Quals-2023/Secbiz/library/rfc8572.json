Variations in\r\nthe solution enable it to be used on both public and private\r\nnetworks.  The provisioning steps are able to update the boot image,\r\ncommit an initial configuration, and execute arbitrary scripts to\r\naddress auxiliary needs.  The updated device is subsequently able to\r\nestablish secure connections with other systems.  For instance, a\r\ndevice may establish NETCONF (RFC 6241) and\/or RESTCONF (RFC 8040)\r\nconnections with deployment-specific network management systems.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":["zerotouch","bootstrap","sztp","ztp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8572","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8572"}
