In systems\r\nwhere EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to avoid\r\nrepeating the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  This\r\ndocument specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to\r\nsupport an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-\r\nauthentication between the peer and an EAP re-authentication server\r\nthrough any authenticator.  The re-authentication server may be in\r\nthe home network or in the local network to which the peer is\r\nconnecting.
