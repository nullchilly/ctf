One key advantage over other schemes is\r\nthat HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network-\r\nlayer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the\r\ncurrent Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the\r\ntraditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These\r\n\"middleboxes\" are intermediary devices that perform functions other\r\nthan the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path\r\nbetween source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of\r\nmiddleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some\r\naspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication\r\nimpossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP\r\ncommunication across network paths that include specific types of\r\nmiddleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It\r\nidentifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications\r\nthat affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This\r\ndocument is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2008","keywords":["HIP","host identity protocol","host identity payload","NAT traversal","middlebox traversal","firewall traversal","ID locator split","problem statement"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5207","errata_url":null}
