    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes the data plane protocol for the
      Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP). LISP defines two
      namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), which identify end hosts;
      and Routing Locators (RLOCs), which identify network attachment
      points. With this, LISP effectively separates control from data
      and allows routers to create overlay networks. LISP-capable
      routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC
      mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">LISP requires no change to either host protocol stacks or
      underlay routers and offers Traffic Engineering (TE),
      multihoming, and mobility, among other features.</t>

  attachment point from the node's identity <xref target="CHIAPPA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CHIAPPA"/>. As a result, LISP creates two namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers
  (EIDs), which are used to identify end hosts (e.g., nodes or Virtual
  Machines); and routable Routing Locators (RLOCs), which are used to identify
  network attachment points.  LISP then defines functions for mapping
  between the two namespaces and for encapsulating traffic
  originated by devices using non-routable EIDs for transport across a
  network infrastructure that routes and forwards using RLOCs. LISP
  encapsulation uses a dynamic form of tunneling where no static provisioning
  is required or necessary.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">LISP is an overlay protocol that separates control from data; this
  document specifies the data plane as well as how LISP-capable

        <dd pn="section-3-1.18">An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or
    128-bit (for IPv6) value that identifies a host. EIDs are generally

    have the same properties as any other IP address used in that
    manner; this means, among other things, that it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
    unique. An EID is allocated to a host from an EID-Prefix block
    associated with the site where the host is located.  An EID can be
    used by a host to refer to other hosts. Note that EID blocks <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>

    structure (subnetting) for routing within the site; this structure
    is not visible to the underlay routing system. In theory, the bit

      <name slugifiedName="name-basic-overview">Basic Overview</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">One key concept of LISP is that end-systems operate the same way
      when LISP is not in use as well as when LISP is in use. The IP addresses that
      hosts use for tracking sockets
  and connections, and for sending and receiving packets, do not
  change. In LISP terminology, these IP addresses are called Endpoint
  Identifiers (EIDs).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">Routers continue to forward packets based on IP destination
  addresses. When a packet is LISP encapsulated, these addresses are
  referred to as RLOCs. Most routers along a path
  between two hosts will not change; they continue to perform
  routing/forwarding lookups on the destination addresses. For routers
  between the source host and the ITR as well as routers from the ETR
  to the destination host, the destination address is an EID. For the
  routers between the ITR and the ETR, the destination address is an
  RLOC.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">Another key LISP concept is the "Tunnel Router". A Tunnel Router
  prepends LISP headers on host-originated packets and strips them
  prior to final delivery to their destination. The IP addresses in
  this "outer header" are RLOCs. During end-to-end packet
  exchange between two Internet hosts, an ITR prepends a new LISP
  header to each packet, and an ETR strips the new header. The ITR
  performs EID-to-RLOC lookups to determine the routing path to the
  ETR, which has the RLOC as one of its IP addresses. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">Some basic rules governing LISP are:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-4-5">
        <li pn="section-4-5.1">End-systems only send to addresses that are EIDs.  EIDs are
      typically IP addresses assigned to hosts (other types of EIDs are
      supported by LISP; see <xref target="RFC8060" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8060"/> for further
      information). End-systems don't know that addresses are EIDs
      versus RLOCs but assume that packets get to their intended
      destinations.  In a system where LISP is deployed, LISP routers
      intercept EID-addressed packets and assist in delivering them
      across the network core where EIDs cannot be routed.  The
      procedure a host uses to send IP packets does not change.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-5.2">LISP routers prepend and strip outer headers with RLOC addresses. See  <xref target="MOSTLY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2"/> for details.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-5.3">RLOCs are always IP addresses assigned to routers, preferably
      topologically oriented addresses from provider Classless
      Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. </li>
        <li pn="section-4-5.4">When a router originates packets, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use as a source
      address either an EID or RLOC. When acting as a host (e.g., when
      terminating a transport session such as Secure Shell (SSH),
      TELNET, or the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)), it
      <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use an EID that is explicitly assigned for that purpose. An
      EID that identifies the router as a host <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used as an
      RLOC; an EID is only routable within the scope of a site.  A
      typical BGP configuration might demonstrate this "hybrid"
      EID/RLOC usage where a router could use its "host-like" EID to
      terminate internal BGP (iBGP) sessions to other routers in a site while at the
      same time using RLOCs to terminate external BGP (eBGP) sessions to routers
      outside the site.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-5.5">Packets with EIDs in them are not expected to be delivered
      end to end in the absence of an EID-to-RLOC mapping
      operation. They are expected to be used locally for intra-site
      communication or to be encapsulated for inter-site
      communication.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-5.6">EIDs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be structured (subnetted) in a manner suitable
      for local routing within an Autonomous System (AS).</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-6">An additional LISP header <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be prepended to packets by a
    TE-ITR when rerouting of the path for a packet is desired. A
    potential use case for this would be an ISP router that needs to
    perform Traffic Engineering for packets flowing through its
    network. In such a situation, termed "Recursive Tunneling", an ISP
    transit acts as an additional ITR, and the destination RLOC it
    uses for the new prepended header would be either a TE-ETR within
    the ISP (along an intra-ISP traffic-engineered path) or a TE-ETR
    within another ISP (an inter-ISP traffic-engineered path, where an
      agreement to build such a path exists). </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-7">In order to avoid excessive packet overhead as well as possible
    encapsulation loops, it is  <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that a maximum of two
    LISP headers can be prepended to a packet. For initial LISP
    deployments, it is assumed that two headers is sufficient, where
    the first prepended header is used at a site for separation of location and identity and the second prepended header is used inside a
    service provider for Traffic Engineering purposes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-8">Tunnel Routers can be placed fairly flexibly in a multi-AS
    topology. For example, the ITR for a particular end-to-end packet
    exchange might be the first-hop or default router within a site
    for the source host. Similarly, the ETR might be the last-hop
    router directly connected to the destination host. As another
    example, perhaps for a VPN service outsourced to an ISP by a site,
    the ITR could be the site's border router at the service
    provider attachment point. Mixing and matching of site-operated,
    ISP-operated, and other Tunnel Routers is allowed for maximum
    flexibility. </t>

         the source RLOC (outer-header source IP address) in a
         received LISP packet. Such a cache entry is termed a
         "glean mapping" and only contains a single RLOC for the EID

         RLOCs <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be verified by sending a LISP Map-Request for

      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-3">The following are different scenarios for choosing
        RLOCs and the controls that are available:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-9-4">
        <li pn="section-9-4.1">The server-side returns one RLOC. The client-side can only
        use one RLOC. The server-side has complete control of the
        selection.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-4.2">The server-side returns a list of RLOCs where a subset
        of the list has the same best Priority. The client can only use
        the subset list according to the
        weighting assigned by the server-side. In this case, the
        server-side controls both the subset list and load splitting
        across its members. The client-side can use RLOCs outside
        of the subset list if it determines that the subset
        list is unreachable (unless RLOCs are set to a Priority of 255).
        Some sharing of control exists: the server-side determines
        the destination RLOC list and load distribution while the
        client-side has the option of using alternatives to this list if
        RLOCs in the list are unreachable.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-4.3">The server-side sets a Weight of zero for the RLOC subset
        list. In this case, the client-side can choose how the traffic
        load is spread across the subset list. See <xref target="loc-hash" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 12"/> for details on load-sharing mechanisms.
        Control is shared by the server-side determining the list and
        the client-side determining load distribution. Again, the
        client can use alternative RLOCs if the server-provided list
        of RLOCs is unreachable.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-4.4">Either side (more likely the server-side ETR) decides to "glean"
        the RLOCs. For example, if the server-side ETR gleans RLOCs, then
	the client-side ITR gives the server-side ETR responsibility for
	bidirectional RLOC reachability and preferability.  Server-side
          ETR gleaning of the client-side ITR RLOC is done by caching the
          inner-header source EID and the outer-header source RLOC of
          received packets. The client-side ITR controls how traffic is
	  returned and can, as an alternative, use an outer-header source
	  RLOC, which then can be added to the list the server-side ETR uses
	  to return traffic.  Since no Priority or Weights are provided
          using this method, the server-side ETR <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> assume that each
          client-side ITR RLOC uses the same best Priority with a Weight
          of zero.  In addition, since EID-Prefix encoding cannot be conveyed
          in data packets, the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache on Tunnel Routers can grow
          very large. Gleaning has several important considerations.
          A "gleaned" Map-Cache entry is only stored and used for a <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> period of 3 seconds,
          pending verification.  Verification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed by
          sending a Map-Request to the source EID (the inner-header IP source
          address) of the received encapsulated packet.  A reply to this
          "verifying Map-Request" is used to fully populate the Map-Cache entry
          for the "gleaned" EID and is stored and used for the time indicated
          in the 'Time to Live' field of a received Map-Reply.  When a verified Map-Cache entry is stored, data gleaning no longer occurs for subsequent
          packets that have a source EID that matches the EID-Prefix of the
          verified entry.  This "gleaning" mechanism <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used over
          the public Internet and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be used in trusted and closed
          deployments.  Refer to <xref target="SECURITY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 16"/> for security issues regarding this

      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-2">The optional gleaning mechanism is offered to directly obtain
  a mapping from the LISP-encapsulated packets. Specifically, an xTR
  can learn the EID-to-RLOC mapping by inspecting the source RLOC and
  source EID of an encapsulated packet and insert this new mapping
  into its Map-Cache. An off-path attacker can spoof the source EID
  address to divert the traffic sent to the victim's spoofed EID. If
  the attacker spoofs the source RLOC, it can mount a DoS attack by
  redirecting traffic to the spoofed victim's RLOC, potentially
  overloading it.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-3">The LISP data plane defines several mechanisms to monitor RLOC
  data plane reachability; in this context, Locator-Status-Bits,
  nonce-present bits, and Echo-Nonce bits of the LISP encapsulation header
  can be manipulated by an attacker to mount a DoS attack. An off-path
  attacker able to spoof the RLOC and/or nonce of a victim's xTR can
  manipulate such mechanisms to declare false information about the
  RLOC's reachability status.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-4">An example of such attacks is when an off-path attacker can exploit the
  Echo-Nonce mechanism by sending data packets to an ITR with a random
  nonce from an ETR's spoofed RLOC. Note that the attacker only has a small window
  of time within which to guess a valid nonce that the ITR is requesting to be echoed. The goal is to convince the ITR that the ETR's RLOC is
  reachable even when it may not be reachable. If the attack is
  successful, the ITR believes the wrong reachability status of the
  ETR's RLOC until RLOC-Probing detects the correct status. This time
  frame is on the order of tens of seconds.  This specific attack can
  be mitigated by preventing RLOC spoofing in the network by deploying
  Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) per <xref target="RFC8704" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8704">BCP 84</xref>. In order to exploit
  this vulnerability, the off-path attacker must also send Echo-Nonce
  packets at a high rate. If the nonces have never been requested by the
  ITR, it can protect itself from erroneous reachability attacks.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-5">A LISP-specific uRPF check is also possible. When decapsulating,
    an ETR can check that the source EID and RLOC are valid EID-to-RLOC
    mappings by checking the Mapping System.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-16-6">Map-Versioning is a data plane mechanism used to signal to a peering
  xTR that a local EID-to-RLOC mapping has been updated so that the
  peering xTR uses a LISP control plane signaling message to retrieve a
  fresh mapping.  This can be used by an attacker to forge the
  'Map-Version' field of a LISP-encapsulated header and force an
  excessive amount of signaling between xTRs that may overload them.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should be constructed on entry to and exit from any IP-in-IP tunnel.  On encapsulation, it updates RFC 3168 to bring all IP-in-IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with RFC 4301 IPsec ECN processing.  On decapsulation, it updates both RFC 3168 and RFC 4301 to add new behaviours for previously unused combinations of inner and outer headers.  The new rules ensure the ECN field is correctly propagated across a tunnel whether it is used to signal one or two severity levels of congestion; whereas before, only one severity level was supported.  Tunnel endpoints can be updated in any order without affecting pre-existing uses of the ECN field, thus ensuring backward compatibility.  Nonetheless, operators wanting to support two severity levels (e.g., for pre-congestion notification -- PCN) can require compliance with this new specification.  A thorough analysis of the reasoning for these changes and the implications is included.  In the unlikely event that the new rules do not meet a specific need, RFC 4774 gives guidance on designing alternate ECN semantics, and this document extends that to include tunnelling issues.

When multicast is not available to connect the multicast sites together, a signal-free mechanism can be used to allow traffic to flow between sites.  The mechanism described in this document uses unicast replication and encapsulation over the core network for the data plane and uses the LISP mapping database system so encapsulators at the source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators at the receiver LISP multicast sites.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document identifies a need for and proposes improvement of the unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) techniques (see RFC 3704) for detection and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38).  Strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see RFC 3704).  However, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has shortcomings.  This document describes enhanced feasible-path uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC 3704).  The proposed EFP-uRPF methods aim to significantly reduce false positives regarding invalid detection in source address validation (SAV).  Hence, they can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.  This document updates RFC 3704.</t>

              <t indent="0">Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space.</t>
              <t indent="0">Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

The key workshop findings include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth, constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet sites that may be using either IPv4, IPv6, or both but that are not running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP-speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the global routing system, so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites.  This document introduces three such mechanisms.  The first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ITR), to act as an intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking hosts.  Second, this document adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP ITRs and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) to substitute routable IP addresses for non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this document introduces the Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ETR) to handle cases where a LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP sites without encapsulation.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document updates the IPv6 specification (RFC 2460) to improve performance when a tunnel protocol uses UDP with IPv6 to tunnel packets.  The performance improvement is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement for tunnel protocols whose header information is protected on the "inner" packet being carried.  Relaxing this requirement removes the overhead associated with the computation of UDP checksums on IPv6 packets that carry the tunnel protocol packets.  This specification describes how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement can be relaxed when the encapsulated packet itself contains a checksum.  It also describes the limitations and risks of this approach and discusses the restrictions on the use of this method.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
              <t indent="0">Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
              <t indent="0">Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document specifies Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD). This is a robust method for Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) for datagram Packetization Layers (PLs). It allows a PL, or a datagram application that uses a PL, to discover whether a network path can support the current size of datagram. This can be used to detect and reduce the message size when a sender encounters a packet black hole. It can also probe a network path to discover whether the maximum packet size can be increased. This provides functionality for datagram transports that is equivalent to the PLPMTUD specification for TCP, specified in RFC 4821, which it updates. It also updates the UDP Usage Guidelines to refer to this method for use with UDP datagrams and updates SCTP.</t>
              <t indent="0">The document provides implementation notes for incorporating Datagram PMTUD into IETF datagram transports or applications that use datagram transports.</t>
