Internationalization of\r\nthe GSS-API is also covered.\r\n\r\nDomain-based service names are similar to host-based service names,\r\nbut using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in\r\naddition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of domain-based names is\r\nto provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize\r\ninsecure service discovery protocols.  This is achieved by providing\r\na way to name clustered services after the \"domain\" which they\r\nservice, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's\r\nservers based on authentication of their service names.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"May 2008","keywords":["[--------]","domain-based-name","gss-domain-based-services","GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5178","errata_url":null}
