This document provides a\r\nprofile of IKE and PKIX that defines the requirements for using PKI\r\ntechnology in the context of IKE\/IPsec.  The document complements\r\nprotocol specifications such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, which assume the\r\nexistence of public key certificates and related keying materials,\r\nbut which do not address PKI issues explicitly.  This document\r\naddresses those issues.  The intended audience is implementers of PKI\r\nfor IPsec.
