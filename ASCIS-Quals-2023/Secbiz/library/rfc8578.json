These use cases differ notably in their network\r\ntopologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad\r\nindustry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use\r\ncase, this document will identify the use case, identify\r\nrepresentative solutions used today, and describe potential\r\nimprovements that DetNet can enable.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["DetNet","AVB","TSN","SRP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8578","errata_url":null}
