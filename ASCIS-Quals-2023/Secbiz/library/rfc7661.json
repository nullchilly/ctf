It\r\nprovides an experimental update to TCP that allows a TCP sender to\r\nrestart quickly following a rate-limited interval.  This method is\r\nexpected to benefit applications that send rate-limited traffic using\r\nTCP while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThis document also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP\r\nCongestion Window Validation (CWV) defined in RFC 2861 and concludes\r\nthat RFC 2861 sought to address important issues but failed to\r\ndeliver a widely used solution.  This document therefore reclassifies\r\nthe status of RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic.
