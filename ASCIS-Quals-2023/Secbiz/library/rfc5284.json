That object has a defined format that\r\npermits the definition of 256 error codes.

Further, no provision for user-defined\r\nerrors exists in RSVP.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a USER_ERROR_SPEC to be used in addition to the\r\nERROR_SPEC to carry additional user information related to errors.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"August 2008","keywords":["[--------]","resource reservation protocol","user_error_spec","error_spec"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5284","errata_url":null}
