BGPsec is\r\nimplemented via an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that\r\ncarries digital signatures produced by each AS that propagates the\r\nUPDATE message.  The digital signatures provide confidence that every\r\nAS on the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly\r\nauthorized the advertisement of the route.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["BGP","BGPsec","BGP AS-path protection","BGP Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8206"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8205","errata_url":null}
