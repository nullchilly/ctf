This document describes a new kind\r\nof \"regional registrations\", i.e., registrations local to the visited\r\ndomain.  The regional registrations are performed via a new network\r\nentity called a Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA) and introduce a layer of\r\nhierarchy in the visited domain.  Regional registrations reduce the\r\nnumber of signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the\r\nsignaling delay when a mobile node moves from one foreign agent to\r\nanother within the same visited domain.  This document is an optional\r\nextension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","GFA","gateway foreign agent"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4857","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4857"}
