During handover, there is a period\r\nduring which the mobile node is unable to send or receive packets\r\nbecause of link-switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This\r\n\"handover latency\" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures\r\n(namely, movement detection, new Care-of Address configuration, and\r\nBinding Update) is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as\r\nVoice over IP (VoIP).  Reducing the handover latency could be\r\nbeneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as\r\nwell.  This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency\r\ndue to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address\r\nimproving the link-switching latency.\r\n\r\nThis document updates the packet formats for the Handover Initiate\r\n(HI) and Handover Acknowledge (HAck) messages to the Mobility Header\r\nType.
