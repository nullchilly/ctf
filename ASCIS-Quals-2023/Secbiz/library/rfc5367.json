This is achieved by including the list of\r\nresources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a\r\nsubscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually,\r\nthe subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets\r\nnotifications about changes in the resources' states using a single\r\nSUBSCRIBE dialog.
