Since GRASP is designed to support asynchronous\r\noperations, the API will need to be adapted according to the support\r\nfor asynchronicity in various programming languages and operating\r\nsystems.","pub_date":"May 2021","keywords":["Autonomic Networking","Autonomous Operation","Self-Management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8991","errata_url":null}
