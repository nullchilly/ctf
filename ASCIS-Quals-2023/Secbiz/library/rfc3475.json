The ASON architecture specifies a set of reference points that defines the relationship between the ASON architectural entities.  Signaling over interfaces defined in those reference points can make use of protocols that are defined by the IETF in the context of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) work.  This document describes Constraint-Based LSP setup using LDP (CR-LDP) extensions for signaling over the interfaces defined in the ASON reference points.  The purpose of the document is to request that the IANA assigns code points necessary for the CR-LDP extensions.  The protocol specifications for the use of the CR-LDP extensions are found in ITU-T documents.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
