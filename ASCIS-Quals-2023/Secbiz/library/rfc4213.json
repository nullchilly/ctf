Two mechanisms are specified,\r\ndual stack and configured tunneling.  Dual stack implies providing\r\ncomplete implementations of both versions of the Internet Protocol\r\n(IPv4 and IPv6), and configured tunneling provides a means to carry\r\nIPv6 packets over unmodified IPv4 routing infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2893.
