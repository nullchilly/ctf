By speech\r\nprocessing, this document specifically means automatic speech\r\nrecognition (ASR), speaker recognition -- which includes both speaker\r\nidentification (SI) and speaker verification (SV) -- and text-to-speech (TTS).  Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and Real Time\r\nStreaming Protocol (RTSP), address rendezvous and control for\r\ngeneralized media streams.  However, speech processing presents\r\nadditional requirements that none of the extant IETF protocols\r\naddress.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["speech processing","audio streams","si","speaker identification","sv","speaker verification","tts","text to speech"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4313","errata_url":null}
