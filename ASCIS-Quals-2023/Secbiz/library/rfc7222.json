This option can be used\r\nby the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway for\r\nnegotiating Quality-of-Service parameters for a mobile node's IP\r\nflows.  The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing\r\nand marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the path\r\nbetween the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway.\r\nFurthermore, making QoS parameters available on the mobile access\r\ngateway enables mapping of these parameters to QoS rules that are\r\nspecific to the access technology and allows those rules to be\r\nenforced on the access network using access-technology-specific\r\napproaches.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["QoS","Quality of Service","PMIP-QoS","PMIPv6-QoS","WiFi-QoS","3GPP-QoS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7222","errata_url":null}
