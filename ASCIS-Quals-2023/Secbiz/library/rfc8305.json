These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of\r\nwhich may have different performance and connectivity\r\ncharacteristics.  Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4\r\nor IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients\r\nthat attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of\r\nestablishing a connection more quickly.  This document specifies\r\nrequirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and\r\nprovides an example algorithm, referred to as \"Happy Eyeballs\".  This\r\ndocument obsoletes the original algorithm description in RFC 6555.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["IPv6","IPv4","TCP","DNS","NAT64"],"obsoletes":["RFC6555"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8305","errata_url":null}
