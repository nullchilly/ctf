However, existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to\r\nfind an MP address in multi-domain routing networks where a domain is\r\ndefined as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous\r\nSystem (AS).  Hence, the current MPLS Fast Reroute mechanism cannot be used\r\nin order to protect inter-domain TE LSPs from a failure of an Area\r\nBorder Router (ABR) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).  This\r\ndocument specifies the use of existing Record Route Object (RRO) IPv4\r\nand IPv6 sub-objects (with a new flag defined) thus defining the\r\nnode-id sub-object in order to solve this issue.
