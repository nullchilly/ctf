An alternative\r\nbinary representation is described.\r\n\r\nOptionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as a map image)\r\ncan be included, along with the relationship of the map coordinate\r\nsystem to the reference\/offset coordinate system, to allow display of\r\nthe map with the reference point and the relative offset.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":["Relative","location"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7035","errata_url":null}
