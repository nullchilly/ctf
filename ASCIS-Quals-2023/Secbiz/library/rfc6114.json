CLEFIA is a 128-bit blockcipher, with key lengths of 128,\r\n192, and 256 bits, which is compatible with the interface of the\r\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES).  The algorithm of CLEFIA was published in\r\n2007, and its security has been scrutinized in the public community.  CLEFIA is\r\none of the new-generation lightweight blockcipher algorithms designed after\r\nAES.  Among them, CLEFIA offers high performance in software and hardware as\r\nwell as lightweight implementation in hardware.  CLEFIA will be of benefit to\r\nthe Internet, which will be connected to more distributed and constrained\r\ndevices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; \r\nit is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["security","lightweight cryptography","encryption algorithm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6114","errata_url":null}
