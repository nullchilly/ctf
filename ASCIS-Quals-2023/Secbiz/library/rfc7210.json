The database is designed to support both manual and\r\nautomated key management.  In addition to describing the schema for the\r\ndatabase, this document describes the operations that can be performed on the\r\ndatabase as well as the requirements for the routing protocols that wish to\r\nuse the database.  In many typical scenarios, the protocols do not directly\r\nuse the long-lived key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive\r\na short-lived key from a long-lived key.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7210","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7210"}
