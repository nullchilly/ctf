This operation\r\nmay be particularly important in NAT444 infrastructures where a\r\ncustomer endpoint may be assigned a non-RFC1918 address, thus breaking\r\nthe return path for anycast-based 6to4 operation.  6to4-PMT has\r\nbeen successfully used in a production network, implemented\r\nas open source code, and implemented by a major routing vendor.  This \r\ndocument is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2012","keywords":["6to4-PMT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7526"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6732","errata_url":null}
