The\r\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's\r\nroutes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol\r\nLabel Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the\r\nprovider's backbone.  Support currently exists for both IPv4 and IPv6\r\nVPNs; however, only Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) as\r\nPE-CE protocol is specified.  This document extends those\r\nspecifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing\r\nprotocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to that of\r\nOSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2012","keywords":["[--------]","L3VPN","BGP\/MPLS","VPN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6565","errata_url":null}
