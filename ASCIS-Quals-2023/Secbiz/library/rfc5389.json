It can be used by an endpoint to\r\ndetermine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can\r\nalso be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a\r\nkeep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  STUN works with many\r\nexisting NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.\r\n\r\nSTUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool\r\nto be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.  This is an\r\nimportant change from the previous version of this specification (RFC\r\n3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3489.
