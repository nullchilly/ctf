As the\r\nenvironments in which SIP is deployed grow more numerous and diverse,\r\nmodifying or extending SIP in certain ways may threaten the\r\ninteroperability and security of the protocol; however, the IETF\r\nprocess must also cater to the realities of existing deployments and\r\nserve the needs of the implementers working with SIP.  This document\r\ntherefore defines the functions of two long-lived working groups in\r\nthe RAI Area that are, respectively, responsible for the maintenance\r\nof the core SIP specifications and the development of new efforts to\r\nextend and apply work in this space.  This document obsoletes RFC\r\n3427.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["RAI","sipping"],"obsoletes":["RFC3427"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3265","RFC3969"],"updated_by":["RFC7957"],"see_also":["BCP0067"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5727","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5727"}
