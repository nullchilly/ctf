When an ingress TRILL switch\r\nreceives a data frame for a destination address (MAC&Label) that the\r\nswitch does not know, the data frame is flooded within the frame's\r\nData Label across the TRILL campus.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the framework for using directory services to\r\nassist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination frames,\r\nparticularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP\/ND (Address\r\nResolution Protocol \/ Neighbor Discovery), thus improving TRILL\r\nnetwork scalability and security.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["TRILL","Orchestration","Directory","Push","Pull","RBridge","ARP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7067","errata_url":null}
