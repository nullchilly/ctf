This document provides\r\nrecommendations for the functionality of Internet Fax Gateways.  In\r\nthis context, an \"offramp gateway\" provides facsimile data transmission\r\nfrom i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an \"onramp gateway\" provides data\r\ntransmission form GSTN fax to i-fax.  The recommendations in this\r\ndocument apply to the integrated service including Internet Fax\r\nterminals, computers with i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN Fax\r\nterminals on the GSTN.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["general switched telephone network facsimile service","gstn fax","internet fax service","i-fax","onramp gateway"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4160","errata_url":null}
