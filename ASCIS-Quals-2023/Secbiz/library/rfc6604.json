A DNS response header has an RCODE (Response Code) field, used\r\nfor indicating errors, and response status bits.  This document\r\nclarifies, in the case of such redirected queries, how the RCODE and\r\nstatus bits correspond to the initial query cycle (where the CNAME or\r\nthe like was detected) and subsequent or final query cycles.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"April 2012","keywords":["[--------]","DNS","DNSSEC","CNAME","DNAME","Domain Name","response code","canonical name"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1035","RFC2308","RFC2672"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6604","errata_url":null}
