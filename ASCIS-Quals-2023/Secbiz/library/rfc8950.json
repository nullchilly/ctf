The AFI\/SAFI\r\ndefinitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for\r\nadvertising a next-hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when\r\nadvertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or\r\nVPN-IPv4 NLRI. \r\n\r\nThis document specifies the extensions necessary to allow the\r\nadvertising of IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop address\r\nthat belongs to the IPv6 protocol.  This comprises an extension of\r\nthe AFI\/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the next hop for\r\nIPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the\r\nencoding of the next hop to determine which of the protocols the\r\naddress actually belongs to, and a BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP\r\npeers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and\r\nVPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 next hop.
