{"draft":"draft-ietf-manet-smf-14","doc_id":"RFC6621","title":"Simplified Multicast Forwarding","authors":["J. Macker, Ed."],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"55","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"Mobile Ad-hoc Networks","abstract":"This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)\r\nmechanism that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast\r\nforwarding suitable for limited wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc\r\nnetwork (MANET) use.  It is mainly applicable in situations where\r\nefficient flooding represents an acceptable engineering design trade-off.\r\nIt defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection\r\n(DPD), to be applied in the forwarding process, for both IPv4 and\r\nIPv6 protocol use.  This document also specifies optional mechanisms\r\nfor using reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data\r\ndistribution within a mesh topology as compared to Classic Flooding.\r\nInteractions with other protocols, such as use of information\r\nprovided by concurrently running unicast routing protocols or\r\ninteraction with other multicast protocols, as well as multiple\r\ndeployment approaches are also described.  Distributed algorithms for\r\nselecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in\r\nthe appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast\r\nMANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this\r\narea and is beyond the scope of this document.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["[--------]","routing","flooding","optimized flooding","CDS","connected dominating set","duplicate packet detection","hash-based packet detection","MPR","MPR-CDS","E-CDS","edge mobility","mobile ad hoc","mesh network"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6621","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6621"}
