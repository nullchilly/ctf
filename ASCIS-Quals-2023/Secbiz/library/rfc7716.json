With a small number\r\nof relatively minor modifications, the same BGP procedures can also\r\nbe used to distribute multicast routing information that is not\r\nspecific to any VPN.  Multicast that is outside the context of a VPN\r\nis known as \"Global Table Multicast\", or sometimes simply as\r\n\"Internet multicast\".  In this document, we describe the\r\nmodifications that are needed to use the BGP-MVPN procedures for\r\nGlobal Table Multicast.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7716","errata_url":null}
