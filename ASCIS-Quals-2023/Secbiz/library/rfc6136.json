The OAM framework is intended to provide OAM layering across\r\nL2VPN services, pseudowires (PWs), and Packet Switched Network (PSN)\r\ntunnels.  This document is intended to identify OAM requirements\r\nfor L2VPN services, i.e., Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), Virtual Private\r\nWire Service (VPWS), and IP-only LAN Service (IPLS). Furthermore, if\r\nL2VPN service OAM requirements impose specific requirements on PW\r\nOAM and\/or PSN OAM, those specific PW and\/or PSN OAM requirements\r\nare also identified.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6136","errata_url":null}
