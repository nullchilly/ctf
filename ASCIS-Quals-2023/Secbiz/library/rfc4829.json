The preempted LSPs are then rerouted by\r\ntheir respective \\%Head-end Label Switch Router (LSR).  This document\r\npresents a flexible policy that can be used to achieve different\r\nobjectives: preempt the lowest priority LSPs; preempt the minimum\r\nnumber of LSPs; preempt the set of TE LSPs that provide the closest\r\namount of bandwidth to the required bandwidth for the preempting TE\r\nLSPs (to minimize bandwidth wastage); preempt the LSPs that will have\r\nthe maximum chance to get rerouted.  Simulation results are given and\r\na comparison among several different policies, with respect to\r\npreemption cascading, number of preempted LSPs, priority, wasted\r\nbandwidth and blocking probability is also included.
