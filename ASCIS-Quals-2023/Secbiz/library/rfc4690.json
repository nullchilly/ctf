It describes problems both at the\r\ntime of registration and for use of those names in the DNS.  It\r\nrecommends that IETF should update the RFCs relating to IDNs and a\r\nframework to be followed in doing so, as well as summarizing and\r\nidentifying some work that is required outside the IETF.  In\r\nparticular, it proposes that some changes be investigated for the\r\nInternationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard and\r\nits supporting tables, based on experience gained since those\r\nstandards were completed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2006","keywords":["dns","domain namespace","idna","internationalizing domain names in applications"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4690","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4690"}
