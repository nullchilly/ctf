Generalized MPLS extends the MPLS control plane to encompass time-division (e.g., Synchronous Optical Network and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, SONET\/SDH), wavelength (optical lambdas) and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).  This document presents a functional description of the extensions.  Protocol specific formats and mechanisms, and technology specific details are specified in separate documents.
