This document describes private\r\nextensions to the Session Initiation Protocol, RFC 3261, for\r\nsupporting the exchange of customer information and billing\r\ninformation between trusted entities in the PacketCable Distributed\r\nCall Signaling Architecture.  These extensions provide mechanisms for\r\naccess network coordination to prevent theft of service, customer\r\noriginated trace of harassing calls, support for operator services\r\nand emergency services, and support for various other regulatory\r\nissues.  The use of the extensions is only applicable within closed\r\nadministrative domains, or among federations of administrative\r\ndomains with previously agreed-upon policies where coordination of\r\ncharging and other functions is required.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["P-DCS-TRACE-PARTY-ID","P-DCS-OSPS","P-DCS-BILLING-INFO","P-DCS-LAES","P-DCS-Redirect","P-DCS-INFO"],"obsoletes":["RFC3603"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5503","errata_url":null}
