To enable discussion of multi-party features and\r\napplications, we define an abstract call model for describing the\r\nmedia relationships required by many of these.  The model and actions\r\ndescribed here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP\r\nsignaling and\/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media\r\nrelationships.  In addition to its dialog manipulation aspect, this\r\nframework includes requirements for communicating related information\r\nand events such as conference and session state and session history.\r\nThis framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of\r\nSIP applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of\r\nprimitives (not services), invoker and participant oriented\r\nprimitives, signaling and mixing model independence, and others.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2010","keywords":["call control","multiparty","features","mixing","refer","3pcc","Refer method","Replaces header field","Join header field","conferencing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5850","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5850"}
