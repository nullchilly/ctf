The security\r\nmodel used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used\r\nby web browsers.  The protocol consists of an opening handshake\r\nfollowed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of\r\nthis technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based\r\napplications that need two-way communication with servers that does\r\nnot rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using\r\nXMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).
