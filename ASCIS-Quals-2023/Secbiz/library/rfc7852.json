The intent is that every emergency call carry as\r\nmuch of the information described here as possible using the\r\nmechanisms described here.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms permit the data to be conveyed by reference (as an\r\nexternal resource) or by value (within the body of a SIP message or a\r\nlocation object).  This follows the tradition of prior emergency\r\nservices standardization work where data can be conveyed by value\r\nwithin the call signaling (i.e., in the body of the SIP message) or\r\nby reference.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["Additional Call Data","Emergency Services","Call Information"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6443","RFC6881"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7852","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7852"}
