This includes\r\nvalidation of the key derivation function (KDF) based on a set of\r\ntest connection parameters as well as validation of the message\r\nauthentication code (MAC). Vectors are provided for both currently\r\nrequired pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: KDF_HMAC_SHA1 and HMAC-\r\nSHA-1-96, and KDF_AES_128_CMAC and AES-128-CMAC-96. The vectors also\r\nvalidate both whole TCP segments as well as segments whose options\r\nare excluded for middlebox traversal.","pub_date":"May 2022","keywords":["TCP","authentication","option","test vector"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9235","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9235"}
