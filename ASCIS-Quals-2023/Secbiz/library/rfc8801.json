PvDs allows hosts to manage connections to\r\nmultiple networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home\r\nrouter provides connectivity through both a broadband and cellular\r\nnetwork provider.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs\r\nthrough a Router Advertisement (RA) option. This RA option announces\r\na PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between\r\nPvDs. The option can directly carry some information about a PvD and\r\ncan optionally point to PvD Additional Information that can be\r\nretrieved using HTTP over TLS.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["IPv6","Provisioning","DHCP","PvD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8801","errata_url":null}
