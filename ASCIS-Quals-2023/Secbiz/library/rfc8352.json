It summarizes the main link-layer\r\ntechniques used for energy-efficient networking, and it highlights\r\nthe impact of such techniques on the upper-layer protocols so that\r\nthey can together achieve an energy-efficient behavior.  The document\r\nalso provides an overview of energy-efficient mechanisms available at\r\neach layer of the IETF protocol suite specified for constrained-node\r\nnetworks.","pub_date":"April 2018","keywords":["IoT","Radio Duty Cycling","6LoWPAN","6Lo","CoAP","RPL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8352","errata_url":null}
