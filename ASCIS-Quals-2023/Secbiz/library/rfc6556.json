This\r\nnote describes a test that can be used to determine whether an\r\napplication can reliably establish sessions quickly in a complex\r\nenvironment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6\r\ndeployment with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering.\r\nThis test is not a test of a specific algorithm, but of the external\r\nbehavior of the system as a black box.  Any algorithm that has the\r\nintended external behavior will be accepted by it.  This document is \r\nnot an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"April 2012","keywords":["test methodology","IPv4","IPv6","session startup","metrics"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6556","errata_url":null}
