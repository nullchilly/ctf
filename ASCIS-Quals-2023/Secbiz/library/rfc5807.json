The\r\nmaster key is derived from the Master Session Key of the Extensible\r\nAuthentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA\r\nauthentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic independence\r\namong enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across\r\ndifferent address families.
