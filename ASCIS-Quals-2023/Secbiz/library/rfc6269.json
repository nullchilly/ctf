Several possible\r\nsolutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of\r\nshared IPv4 addressing.  These solutions give rise to a number of\r\nissues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address\r\nsharing approaches.  Such issues include application failures,\r\nadditional service monitoring complexity, new security\r\nvulnerabilities, and so on.  Solution-specific discussions are out of\r\nscope.\r\n\r\nDeploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the\r\npublic IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing\r\nmechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.  This \r\ndocument is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["IPv4 address exhaustion","completion","shared","sharing issues"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6269","errata_url":null}
