The protocol defined in\r\nthis document uses RADIUS-based interfaces of the mobile access\r\ngateway and the local mobility anchor with the AAA server for\r\nauthentication, authorization, and policy functions.  The RADIUS\r\ninteractions between the mobile access gateway and the RADIUS-based\r\nAAA server take place when the mobile node (MN) attaches,\r\nauthenticates, and authorizes to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.\r\nFurthermore, this document defines the RADIUS-based interface between\r\nthe local mobility anchor and the AAA RADIUS server for authorizing\r\nreceived Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobile node's mobility\r\nsession.  In addition to the interactions related to mobility session\r\nsetup, this document defines the baseline for the mobile access\r\ngateway and the local mobility anchor generated accounting.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2012","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8044"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6572","errata_url":null}
