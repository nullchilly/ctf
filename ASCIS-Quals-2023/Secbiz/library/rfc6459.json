Operators that have deployed networks based on 3rd\r\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) network architectures are\r\nfacing IPv4 address shortages at the Internet registries and are\r\nfeeling pressure to migrate to IPv6.  This document describes the\r\nsupport for IPv6 in 3GPP network architectures.
