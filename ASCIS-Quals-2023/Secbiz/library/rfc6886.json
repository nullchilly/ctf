Included\r\nin the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IPv4 address\r\nof a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make its external IPv4\r\naddress and port known to peers that may wish to communicate with it.\r\nFrom 2005 onwards, this protocol was implemented in Apple products\r\nincluding Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base\r\nstations.  In 2013, NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) was\r\nsuperseded by the IETF Standards Track RFC \"Port Control Protocol\r\n(PCP)\", which builds on NAT-PMP and uses a compatible packet format,\r\nbut adds a number of significant enhancements.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6886","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6886"}
