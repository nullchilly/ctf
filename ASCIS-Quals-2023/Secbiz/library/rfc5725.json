Lague"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"9","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Audio\/Video Transport","abstract":"This document defines a new report block type within the framework of\r\nRTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs).  One of the\r\ninitial XR report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE)\r\nReport Block.  This report conveys information regarding the\r\nindividual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet receipt and loss\r\nevents experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the\r\ntransmission of the report.  The new report, which is referred to as\r\nthe Post-repair Loss RLE report, carries information regarding the\r\npackets that remain lost after all loss-repair methods are applied.\r\nBy comparing the RTP packet receipts\/losses before and after the loss\r\nrepair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness of the loss-\r\nrepair methods in an aggregated fashion.  This document also defines\r\nthe signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session\r\nDescription Protocol (SDP).
