GMPLS routing and\r\nsignaling use common values to indicate the type of switching technology.\r\nThese values are carried in routing protocols via the Switching Capability\r\nfield, and in signaling protocols via the Switching Type field.  While the\r\nvalues used in these fields are the primary indicators of the\r\ntechnology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are\r\nnot consistently defined and used across the different\r\ntechnologies supported by GMPLS.  This document is intended to\r\nresolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching\r\nCapability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use\r\nof the fields.  This document updates all documents that use the\r\nGMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFCs\r\n3471, 4202, 4203, and 5307.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3471","RFC4202","RFC4203","RFC5307"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7074","errata_url":null}
