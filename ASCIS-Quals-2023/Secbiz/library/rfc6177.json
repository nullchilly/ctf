The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted that\r\nrecommendation in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005.\r\nThis document obsoletes the RFC 3177 recommendations on the\r\nassignment of IPv6 address space to end sites.  The exact choice of\r\nhow much address space to assign end sites is an issue for the\r\noperational community.  The IETF's role in this case is limited to\r\nproviding guidance on IPv6 architectural and operational\r\nconsiderations.  This document reviews the architectural and\r\noperational considerations of end site assignments as well as the\r\nmotivations behind the original recommendations in RFC 3177.  Moreover, this\r\ndocument clarifies that a one-size-fits-all recommendation of \/48 is\r\nnot nuanced enough for the broad range of end sites and is no longer\r\nrecommended as a single default.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3177.
