The RTP payload format allows for packetization\r\nof one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP\r\npacket payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into\r\nmultiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of\r\nan HEVC bitstream over a single stream as well as multiple RTP streams.\r\nWhen multiple RTP streams are used, a single transport or multiple\r\ntransports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide\r\napplicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and\r\nhigh-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["H.265",": ISO\/IEC 23008-2","Single NAL Unit Packet","Aggregation Packet","Fragmentation Unit","Payload Content Information Packet","Use of HEVC with Feedback Messages."],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7798","errata_url":null}
