The Session\r\nRecording Protocol specifies the use of SIP, SDP, and RTP to\r\nestablish a Recording Session (RS) between the Session Recording\r\nClient (SRC), which is on the path of the CS, and a Session Recording\r\nServer (SRS) at the recording device.  This document considers only\r\nactive recording, where the SRC purposefully streams media to an SRS\r\nand all participating user agents (UAs) are notified of the\r\nrecording.  Passive recording, where a recording device detects media\r\ndirectly from the network (e.g., using port-mirroring techniques), is\r\noutside the scope of this document.  In addition, lawful intercept is\r\noutside the scope of this document.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["siprec"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7866","errata_url":null}
