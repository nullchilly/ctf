Due to the absence of usage of iFCP address translation \r\nmode, it is deprecated by this document.  iFCP address transparent \r\nmode remains correctly specified.\r\n\r\niFCP address transparent mode has been implemented and is in current\r\nuse; therefore, it is not affected by this document.\r\n\r\nThis document also records the state of Protocol Number 133, which\r\nwas allocated for a pre-standard version of the Fibre Channel Internet\r\nProtocol (FCIP).
