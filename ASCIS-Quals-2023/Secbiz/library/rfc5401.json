The rationale\r\nfor protocol design goals and assumptions are presented.  Technical\r\nchallenges for NACK-based (and in some cases general) reliable\r\nmulticast protocol operation are identified.  These goals and\r\nchallenges are resolved into a set of functional \"building blocks\"\r\nthat address different aspects of reliable multicast protocol\r\noperation.  It is anticipated that these building blocks will be\r\nuseful in generating different instantiations of reliable multicast\r\nprotocols.  This document obsoletes RFC 3941.
