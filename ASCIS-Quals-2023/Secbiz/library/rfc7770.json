This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and\r\nOSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  The Router\r\nInformation (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is defined for this\r\npurpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with an Opaque\r\nLSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a unique\r\nLSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be\r\nadvertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or\r\nautonomous system (AS)).  This document obsoletes RFC 4970 by\r\nproviding a revised specification that includes support for\r\nadvertisement of multiple instances of the RI LSA and a TLV for\r\nfunctional capabilities.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["ospfv2","ospfv3","open shortest path first","ri","router information","lsa","link state advertisement"],"obsoletes":["RFC4970"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7770","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7770"}
