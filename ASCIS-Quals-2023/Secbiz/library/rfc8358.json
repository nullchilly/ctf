The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to\r\ncreate a detached signature, which is stored in a separate companion\r\nfile so that no existing utilities are impacted by the addition of\r\nthe digital signature.\r\n\r\nThe RFC Editor recently published the first RFC that includes non-\r\nASCII characters in a text file.  The conventions specified in RFC\r\n7997 were followed.  We assume that non-ASCII characters will soon\r\nstart appearing in Internet-Drafts as well.  This document updates\r\nthe handling of digital signatures on Internet-Drafts that contain\r\nnon-ASCII characters in a text file.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5485.","pub_date":"March 2018","keywords":["cms","cryptographic message syntax","detached signature"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5485"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8358","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8358"}
