This can be an author's organization, an operational relay,\r\nor one of their agents.  DKIM separates the question of the identity\r\nof the Signer of the message from the purported author of the\r\nmessage.  Assertion of responsibility is validated through a\r\ncryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly\r\nto retrieve the appropriate public key.  Message transit from author\r\nto recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive\r\nchange to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 4871 and RFC 5672.
