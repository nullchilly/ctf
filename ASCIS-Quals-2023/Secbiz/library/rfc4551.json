Examples include different clients working on\r\nbehalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes.\r\nThese clients need a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages\r\nwithin the mailbox.  They must be able to guarantee that only one client\r\ncan change message state (e.g., message flags) at any time.  An\r\nexample of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox as a message\r\nqueue with multiple dequeueing clients.\r\n\r\nThe Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism for\r\nmessage state information that can detect and resolve conflicts between\r\nmultiple writing mail clients.\r\n\r\nThe Conditional Store facility also allows a client to quickly\r\nresynchronize mailbox flag changes.\r\n\r\nThis document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501).
