There is fairly complex state associated with these subscriptions.  The union of the state for all subscriptions to a particular resource is called the watcher information for that resource.  This state is dynamic, changing as subscribers come and go.  As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe to the watcher information for a particular resource.  In order to enable this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers on a resource.  This specification describes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for such state.
