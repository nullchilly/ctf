When a working group is\r\nready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is\r\nfor it to \"adopt\" an existing document as a starting point.  The\r\ndocument that a working group adopts and then develops further is\r\nbased on initial input at varying levels of maturity.  An initial\r\nworking group draft might be a document already in wide use, or it\r\nmight be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group, or it\r\nmight represent any level of maturity in between.  This document\r\ndiscusses how a working group typically handles the formal documents\r\nthat it targets for publication.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["IETF","process","working group","Internet-Draft","adoption","handling","creation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7221","errata_url":null}
