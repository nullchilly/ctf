The\r\nPCE serves requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) that\r\ncommunicate with it over a local API or using the Path Computation\r\nElement Communication Protocol (PCEP).\r\n\r\nThis document examines the applicability of PCE to the ACTN framework.\r\n","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":["PCE","ACTN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8637","errata_url":null}
