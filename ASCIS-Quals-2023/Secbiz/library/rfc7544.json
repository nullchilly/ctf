This document describes a recommended interworking guideline\r\nbetween the Diversion header field and the History-Info header field\r\nto handle call diversion information.  This work is intended to\r\nenable the migration from non-standard implementations toward IETF\r\nspecification-based implementations.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6044, which describes the interworking\r\nbetween the Diversion header field defined in RFC 5806 and the\r\nobsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC 4244.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["Diversion","History-Info"],"obsoletes":["RFC6044"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7544","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7544"}
