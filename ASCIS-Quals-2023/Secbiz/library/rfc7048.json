By default, this time is 3 seconds after the node starts\r\nprobing.  However, if there are no alternative neighbors, this\r\ntimeout behavior is far too impatient.  This document specifies\r\nrelaxed rules for Neighbor Discovery retransmissions that allow an\r\nimplementation to choose different timeout behavior based on whether\r\nor not there are alternative neighbors.
