In many cases, the logs are essential to\r\nidentify an attacker or a host that was used to launch malicious\r\nattacks and for various other purposes of accounting.  Since there is\r\nno standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices\r\nuse proprietary formats; hence, it is difficult to expect consistent\r\nbehavior.  This lack of standardization makes it difficult to write\r\nthe Collector applications that would receive this data and process\r\nit to present useful information.  This document describes the\r\nformats for logging NAT events.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["template"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8158","errata_url":null}
