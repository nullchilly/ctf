It is intended primarily for TAC    connections to target hosts on behalf of TAC users, but it can be used    between any two consenting hosts.  For example, all hosts at one site    (e.g., BBN) can use this option to avoid double login when TELNETing to    one another.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
