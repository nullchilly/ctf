With its new address architecture and allocation\r\npolicies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network\r\ndesigners and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches\r\nto network addressing.  Lack of guidelines on handling this aspect of\r\nnetwork design could slow down the deployment and integration of\r\nIPv6.  This document aims to provide the information and\r\nrecommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6\r\ndeployments.  The document also provides IPv6 addressing case studies\r\nfor both an enterprise and an ISP network.  This memo provides information\r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2008","keywords":["internet protocol version 6","address architecture"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5375","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5375"}
