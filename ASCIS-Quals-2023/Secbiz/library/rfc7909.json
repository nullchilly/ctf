This allows relying parties to\r\ndetect accidental or malicious modifications of such objects.  It\r\nalso allows parties who run Internet Routing Registries or similar\r\ndatabases, but do not yet have authentication (based on Routing\r\nPolicy System Security) of the maintainers of certain objects, to\r\nverify that the additions or modifications of such database objects\r\nare done by the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources\r\nmentioned in those objects.  This document updates RFCs 2622 and 4012\r\nto add the signature attribute to supported RPSL objects.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2622","RFC4012"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7909","errata_url":null}
