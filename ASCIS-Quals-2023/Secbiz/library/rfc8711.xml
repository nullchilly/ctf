    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t pn="section-abstract-1">The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF
evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative
structure. The purpose of this RFC is to document and describe
the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0). It
defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC
Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the
fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It
also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF
LLC Board.</t>

      <t pn="section-1-1">The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the 
IETF evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative 
structure.  The purpose of this document is to document and describe
the IASA 2.0 structure.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising 
tasks is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF Administration 
LLC (IETF LLC). Under this structure, the IETF 
Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated, and its oversight 
and advising functions transferred to the IETF LLC Board.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and 
financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4"><xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IASA2RECS"/> discusses the challenges facing the
original IASA structure as well as several options for reorganizing the
IETF's administration under different legal structures. This document
outlines how the chosen option is structured and describes how
the organization fits together with existing and new IETF
community structures.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">Under IASA 2.0, most of the responsibilities that <xref target="RFC4071" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4071"/> assigned to 
the IETF Administrative Director (IAD) and the Internet Society (ISOC) were 
transferred to the IETF LLC and IETF Administration LLC Executive Director 
(IETF Executive Director). It is the job of the IETF LLC to meet the 
administrative needs of the IETF and to ensure that the IETF LLC meets the 
needs of the IETF community.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">Eliminating the IAOC meant that changes were required in how
trustees could be appointed to the IETF Trust. The details of how this
is done are outside the scope of this document but are covered in
<xref target="RFC8714" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8714"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC4071" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4071"/>, which specified the original IASA, 
<xref target="RFC4333" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4333"/>, which specified the selection guidelines and process for IAOC 
members, and <xref target="RFC7691" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7691"/>, which specified terms for IAOC members.</t>

depends on the LLC Agreement and will refer to it to help 
explain certain aspects of the legal
relationship between the IETF LLC and ISOC.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-2">The LLC Agreement was developed
between legal representatives of the IETF and ISOC and includes all
critical terms of the relationship, while still enabling maximum
unilateral flexibility for the IETF LLC Board.  The LLC Agreement includes only basic
details about how the Board manages itself or manages IETF LLC staff,
so that the Board has flexibility to make changes without amending
the agreement. The Board can independently develop policy or procedures
documents that fill gaps.</t>

consensus-based community input on key issues and otherwise as needed. The IETF community expects 
complete visibility into the financial and legal structure of the IETF LLC. This includes information 
about the IETF LLC annual budget and associated regular financial reports, results of financial and any 
other independent audits, tax filings, significant contracts, or other significant long-term financial 
commitments that bind the IETF LLC. Whatever doesn't have a specific 
justification for being kept confidential is expected to be made public. The Board is expected to develop 
and maintain a public list of confidential items, describing the nature of the information and the reason 
for confidentiality. The Board will also publish its operating procedures.</li>

Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and

another organization, at the request of either party. Similarly, the IETF LLC may be dissolved if necessary. Should 
either event occur, the IETF community should be closely involved in any decisions and plans. Any transfer, 
transition, or dissolution should be conducted carefully and with minimal potential disruption to the IETF.</li>

The issue of increased transparency was important throughout the IASA 2.0 process, with little to no dissent.

        <t pn="section-5.1-1">The IETF LLC is led by an IETF Executive Director chosen by the Board. The IETF Executive Director is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the IETF LLC, including hiring staff to perform various operational functions. The IETF Executive Director and any staff may be employees or independent contractors.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-2">Allowing for the division of responsibilities among multiple staff members and contractors is designed to address some of the concerns raised in 
Section <xref target="I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs" section="3.2" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.2" derivedContent="IASA2RECS"/> (Lack of Resources) and

        <t pn="section-5.1-3">Based on the amount of work previously undertaken by the IAD and others involved in the IETF administration, the design of the IETF LLC anticipated that the IETF Executive Director may need to hire multiple additional staff members. For example, resources to manage fundraising, to manage the various contractors that are engaged to fulfill the IETF's administrative needs, and to support outreach and communications were envisioned.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-4">The IETF has historically benefited from the use of contractors for
	accounting, finance, meeting planning, administrative assistance,
	legal counsel, tools, and web site support, as well as other services
	related to the standards process (e.g., RFC Editor and IANA). Prior to making the transition from IASA to IASA 2.0, the IETF budget reflected specific support from ISOC for communications and fundraising as well as some general support for accounting, finance, legal, and other services. The division of responsibilities between staff and contractors is at the discretion of the IETF Executive Director and their staff.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-5">The IETF has a long history of community involvement in the execution of certain administrative functions, in particular development of IETF tools, the operation of the meeting network by the Network Operations Center (NOC), and some outreach and communications activities conducted by the Education and Mentoring Directorate. The IETF LLC staff is expected to respect the IETF community's wishes about community involvement in these and other functions going forward as long as the staff feels that they can meet the otherwise-stated needs of the community. Establishing the framework to allow the IETF LLC to staff each administrative function as appropriate may require the IETF community to document its consensus expectations in areas where no documentation currently exists.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-6">In summary, the IETF Executive Director, with support from the team that they alone direct and lead, is responsible for:</t>

              <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were created more than ten years ago.  Since then, there has been considerable change in the tasks and in our own expectations.  The IETF community has discussed these changes and the problems they cause.  The community has some sense of the properties they expect from future arrangements, including those related to structure, organization, personnel, and transparency.  This document is a product of a design team, focused on providing additional information to the community about solution options, as well as supporting analysis of the implications of those options. This document reflects the final snapshot of the design team discussion and is published for historical posterity.</t>
