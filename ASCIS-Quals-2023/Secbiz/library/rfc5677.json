The document also describes mechanisms for Mobility Services\r\n(MoS) discovery and transport-layer mechanisms for the reliable\r\ndelivery of MIH messages.  This document does not provide mechanisms\r\nfor securing the communication between a mobile node (MN) and the\r\nMobility Server.  Instead, it is assumed that either lower-layer\r\n(e.g., link-layer) security mechanisms or overall system-specific\r\nproprietary security solutions are used.
