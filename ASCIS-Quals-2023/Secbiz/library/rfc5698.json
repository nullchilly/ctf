This document specifies a data\r\nstructure that enables an automated analysis of the security\r\nsuitability of a given cryptographic algorithm at a given point of\r\ntime, which may be in the past, the present, or the future.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"November 2009","keywords":["[--------]","long term archive","security","policy","hash algorithm","public key algorithm"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5698","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5698"}
