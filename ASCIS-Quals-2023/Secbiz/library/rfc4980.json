As there are many situations in which\r\nmobile networks may be multihomed, a taxonomy is proposed to classify\r\nthe possible configurations.  The possible deployment scenarios of\r\nmultihomed mobile networks are described together with the associated\r\nissues when network mobility is supported by RFC 3963 (NEMO Basic\r\nSupport).  Recommendations are offered on how to address these\r\nissues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2007","keywords":["nemo","ipv6","mobile networks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4980","errata_url":null}
