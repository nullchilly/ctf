Also, the model can be used to retrieve the points\r\nwhere the services are actually being delivered to customers\r\n(including peer networks).\r\n\r\nThis document augments the 'ietf-network' data model defined in RFC\r\n8345 by adding the concept of Service Attachment Points (SAPs). The\r\nSAPs are the network reference points to which network services, such\r\nas Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) or Layer 2 Virtual Private\r\nNetwork (L2VPN), can be attached. One or multiple services can be\r\nbound to the same SAP. Both User-to-Network Interface (UNI) and\r\nNetwork-to-Network Interface (NNI) are supported in the SAP data\r\nmodel.","pub_date":"June 2023","keywords":["Service Infrastructure","User Network Interface","UNI","NNI","Network-to-Network Interface","Inter-AS VPN","CE","PE","Attachment Circuit","Service Delivery Point","Automation","Service Delivery"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9408","errata_url":null}
