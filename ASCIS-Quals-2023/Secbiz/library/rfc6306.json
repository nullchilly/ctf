{"draft":"draft-frejborg-hipv4-14","doc_id":"RFC6306","title":"Hierarchical IPv4 Framework","authors":["P. Frejborg"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"65","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"IRTF","abstract":"This document describes a framework for how the current IPv4 address\r\nspace can be divided into two new address categories: a core address\r\nspace (Area Locators, ALOCs) that is globally unique, and an edge\r\naddress space (Endpoint Locators, ELOCs) that is regionally unique.  In\r\nthe future, the ELOC space will only be significant in a private\r\nnetwork or in a service provider domain.  Therefore, a 32x32 bit\r\naddressing scheme and a hierarchical routing architecture are\r\nachieved.  The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible\r\nwith the current IPv4 Internet.\r\n\r\nThis document also discusses a method for decoupling the location and\r\nidentifier functions -- future applications can make use of the\r\nseparation.  The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain\r\nName System (DNS), the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, middleboxes,\r\nand routers in the Internet.  The framework can be implemented\r\nincrementally for endpoints, DNS, middleboxes, and routers.  This document \r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["core address space","area locators","alocs","edge address space","endpoint locators","elocs"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6306","errata_url":null}
