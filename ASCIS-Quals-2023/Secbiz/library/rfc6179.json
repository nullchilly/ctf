This document proposes an\r\nInternet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) that supports sustainable\r\ngrowth while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to\r\nthe existing routing system.  IRON further addresses other important\r\nissues including routing scaling, mobility management, multihoming,\r\ntraffic engineering and NAT traversal.  While business considerations\r\nare an important determining factor for widespread adoption, they are\r\nout of scope for this document.  This document is a product of the\r\nIRTF Routing Research Group.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["Encapsulation","Tunnel","Architecture","Scalability","Mobility","MANET","Security","Recursion","Addressing","Routing","IPv6","Aerospace","Aeronautics","Space","IRON","RANGER","VET","SEAL","ISATAP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6179","errata_url":null}
