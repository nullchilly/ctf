This occurs, for example, when an endpoint sends multiple\r\nRTP streams in a single RTP session.  This memo updates RFC 3550 with\r\nregard to handling multiple SSRCs per endpoint in RTP sessions, with\r\na particular focus on RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) behavior.  It also\r\nupdates RFC 4585 to change and clarify the calculation of the timeout\r\nof SSRCs and the inclusion of feedback messages.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3550","RFC4585"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8108","errata_url":null}
