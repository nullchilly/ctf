This\r\nspecification defines several new ICMPv6 errors that can be sent by a\r\nnode that discards packets because it is unable to process the\r\nprotocol headers. A node that receives such an ICMPv6 error may use\r\nthe information to diagnose packet loss and may modify what it sends\r\nin future packets to avoid subsequent packet discards.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["extension Headers","destination Options","Hop-by-Hop Options"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8883","errata_url":null}
