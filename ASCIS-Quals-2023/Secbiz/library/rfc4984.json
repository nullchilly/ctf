The primary goal of\r\nthe workshop was to develop a shared understanding of the problems\r\nthat the large backbone operators are facing regarding the\r\nscalability of today's Internet routing system.  The key workshop\r\nfindings include an analysis of the major factors that are driving\r\nrouting table growth, constraints in router technology, and the\r\nlimitations of today's Internet addressing architecture.  It is hoped\r\nthat these findings will serve as input to the IETF community and\r\nhelp identify next steps towards effective solutions.\r\n\r\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\r\nworkshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\r\nthose of the workshop participants and not of the IAB.  Furthermore,\r\nnote that work on issues related to this workshop report is\r\ncontinuing, and this document does not intend to reflect the\r\nincreased understanding of issues nor to discuss the range of\r\npotential solutions that may be the outcome of this ongoing work.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2007","keywords":["routing and addressing workshop","routing table growth","addressing architecture"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4984","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4984"}
