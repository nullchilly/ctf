Such intermediary devices are often\r\ncalled \"middleboxes\".\r\n\r\nRFC 3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes and issues in the\r\nInternet.  Most of those middleboxes utilize or modify application-\r\nlayer data.  This document primarily focuses on devices that observe\r\nand act on information carried in the transport layer, and especially\r\ninformation carried in TCP packets.","pub_date":"February 2019","keywords":["address sharing","NAT","firewall","Service Function","transport","service delivery","Internet architecture","TCP QUIC","Path Layer UDP Substrate"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8517","errata_url":null}
