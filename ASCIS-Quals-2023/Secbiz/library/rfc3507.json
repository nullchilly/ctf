ICAP is, in essence, a lightweight protocol for executing a \"remote procedure call\" on HTTP messages.  It allows ICAP clients to pass HTTP messages to ICAP servers for some sort of transformation or other processing (\"adaptation\").  The server executes its transformation service on messages and sends back responses to the client, usually with modified messages.  Typically, the adapted messages are either HTTP requests or HTTP responses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
