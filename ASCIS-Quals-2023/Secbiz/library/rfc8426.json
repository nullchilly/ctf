In some instances,\r\noperators are also migrating existing services from RSVP-TE to SR\r\nLSPs.  For example, there might be certain services that are well\r\nsuited for SR and need to coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network.\r\nSuch introduction or migration of traffic to SR might require\r\ncoexistence with RSVP-TE in the same network for an extended period\r\nof time, depending on the operator's intent.  The following document\r\nprovides solution options for keeping the traffic engineering\r\ndatabase consistent across the network, accounting for the different\r\nbandwidth utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8426","errata_url":null}
