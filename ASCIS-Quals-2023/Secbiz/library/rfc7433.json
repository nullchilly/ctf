This information, known as call control UUI data, is\r\na small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the\r\nsession and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The\r\nsyntax and semantics for the UUI data used by a specific application\r\nare defined by a UUI package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its\r\nfunction is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document\r\ndefines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data,\r\nalong with an extension mechanism.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":["UUI","Package","Content","Encoding","Media"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7433","errata_url":null}
