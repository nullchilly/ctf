Both multihomed hosts and\r\nhosts with multiple interfaces are considered.  Several network\r\narchitectures are presented to illustrate why source address\r\nselection and next-hop resolution are needed in view of\r\nsource-address-dependent routing.\r\n\r\nThe document is scoped on identifying a set of scenarios for\r\nsource-address-dependent routing from the host's perspective and\r\nanalyzing a set of solutions to mitigate encountered issues.  The\r\ndocument does not make any solution recommendations.","pub_date":"January 2017","keywords":["Neighbor Discovery","Duplicate Address Detection","ND Relay Agent"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8043","errata_url":null}
