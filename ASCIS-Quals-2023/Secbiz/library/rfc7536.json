Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring\r\nbroadband performance is essential to development of the Large-scale\r\nMeasurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information\r\nmodel, and protocol.  This document details two use cases that can\r\nassist in developing that framework.  The details of the measurement\r\nmetrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["lmap"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7536","errata_url":null}
