Unlike earlier\r\nversions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access\r\nwhile integrating support for file locking and the MOUNT protocol.\r\nIn addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation),\r\nCOMPOUND operations, client caching, and internationalization has\r\nbeen added.  Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS\r\nversion 4 operate well in an Internet environment.\r\n\r\nThis document, together with the companion External Data\r\nRepresentation (XDR) description document, RFC 7531, obsoletes RFC\r\n3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC3530"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7931","RFC8587"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7530","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7530"}
