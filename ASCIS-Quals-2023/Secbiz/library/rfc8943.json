Since\r\nthen, additional requirements have become known. This specification\r\ndefines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for\r\napplications needing a textual date representation within the\r\nGregorian calendar without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for\r\ndays since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for\r\napplications needing a numeric date representation without a time.\r\nThis specification is the reference document for IANA registration of\r\nthe CBOR tags defined.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["Compact Binary Object Representation","CBOR","Tag","Date"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8943","errata_url":null}
