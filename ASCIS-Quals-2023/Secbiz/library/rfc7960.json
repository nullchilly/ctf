However, the DMARC mechanism enables potentially\r\ndisruptive interoperability issues when messages do not flow directly\r\nfrom the author's administrative domain to the final Recipients.\r\nCollectively, these email flows are referred to as \"indirect email              \r\nflows\".  This document describes these interoperability issues and\r\npresents possible methods for addressing them.","pub_date":"September 2016","keywords":["DMARC","SMTP","DKIM","SPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7960","errata_url":null}
