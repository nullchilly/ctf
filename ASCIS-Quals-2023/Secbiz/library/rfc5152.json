In this document, a domain refers to a collection of\r\nnetwork elements within a common sphere of address management or path\r\ncomputational responsibility such as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)\r\nareas and Autonomous Systems.\r\n\r\nPer-domain computation applies where the full path of an inter-domain\r\nTE LSP cannot be or is not determined at the ingress node of the TE\r\nLSP, and is not signaled across domain boundaries.  This is most\r\nlikely to arise owing to TE visibility limitations.  The signaling\r\nmessage indicates the destination and nodes up to the next domain\r\nboundary.  It may also indicate further domain boundaries or domain\r\nidentifiers.  The path through each domain, possibly including the\r\nchoice of exit point from the domain, must be determined within the\r\ndomain.
