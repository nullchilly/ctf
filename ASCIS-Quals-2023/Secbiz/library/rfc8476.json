Such advertisements allow\r\nentities (e.g., centralized controllers) to determine whether a\r\nparticular Segment Identifier (SID) stack can be supported in a given\r\nnetwork.  This document only refers to the Signaling MSD as defined\r\nin RFC 8491, but it defines an encoding that can support other MSD\r\ntypes.  Here, the term \"OSPF\" means both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.","pub_date":"December 2018","keywords":["BGP-LS","SID","MSD","OSPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8476","errata_url":null}
