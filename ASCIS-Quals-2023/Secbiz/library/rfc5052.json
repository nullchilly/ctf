This document defines a framework for\r\nthe definition of the information that needs to be communicated in\r\norder to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer, in addition to the\r\nencoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for\r\ncommunication of that information.  Both information communicated with\r\nthe encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated\r\n'out-of-band' are considered.  The procedures for specifying new FEC\r\ncodes, defining the information communication requirements associated\r\nwith those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned\r\nNumbers Authority (IANA) are also described.  The requirements on\r\nContent Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within\r\nthis framework are also defined.  The companion document titled \"The\r\nUse of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast\"\r\ndescribes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3452.
