An MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and\r\nterminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR).  The GMPLS network\r\nprovides transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements\r\nfor operating MPLS-TE networks over GMPLS networks.
