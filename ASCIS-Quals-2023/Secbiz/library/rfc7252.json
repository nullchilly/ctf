The nodes often have 8-bit\r\nmicrocontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained\r\nnetworks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks\r\n(6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical\r\nthroughput of 10s of kbit\/s.  The protocol is designed for machine-\r\nto-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building\r\nautomation.\r\n\r\nCoAP provides a request\/response interaction model between\r\napplication endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and\r\nresources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and\r\nInternet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP\r\nfor integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements\r\nsuch as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for\r\nconstrained environments.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7959","RFC8613","RFC8974","RFC9175"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7252","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7252"}
