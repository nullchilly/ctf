Such content needs\r\nto be converted to an acceptable form,\r\nwith the same information or constrained information (e.g.,\r\nchanging from color to black and white).  In a store-and-forward\r\nenvironment, it may be convenient to have this conversion performed by\r\nan intermediary.  This specification integrates two ESMTP extensions and\r\nthree MIME content header fields, which defines a cooperative\r\nservice that permits authorized, accountable content\r\nform conversion by intermediaries.
