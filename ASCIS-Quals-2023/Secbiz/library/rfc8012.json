Ping is known as a connectivity-verification method and\r\ntraceroute is known as a fault-isolation method, as described in RFC\r\n4379.  When an LSP is signaled using the Entropy Label (EL) described\r\nin RFC 6790, the ability for LSP ping and traceroute operations to\r\ndiscover and exercise ECMP paths is lost for scenarios where Label\r\nSwitching Routers (LSRs) apply different load-balancing techniques.\r\nOne such scenario is when some LSRs apply EL-based load balancing\r\nwhile other LSRs apply load balancing that is not EL based (e.g., IP).\r\nAnother scenario is when an EL-based LSP is stitched with another LSP\r\nthat can be EL based or not EL based.\r\n\r\nThis document extends the MPLS LSP ping and traceroute multipath\r\nmechanisms in RFC 6424 to allow the ability of exercising LSPs that\r\nmake use of the EL.
