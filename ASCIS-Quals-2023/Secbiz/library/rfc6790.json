This memo suggests ways of improving load balancing across\r\nMPLS networks using the concept of \"entropy labels\".  It defines the\r\nconcept, describes why entropy labels are useful, enumerates\r\nproperties of entropy labels that allow maximal benefit, and shows\r\nhow they can be signaled and used for various applications.
