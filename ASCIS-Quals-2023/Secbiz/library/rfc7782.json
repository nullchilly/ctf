Thus,\r\nremote edge RBridges (who are not in the group) will see one host\r\nMedia Access Control (MAC) address being associated with the multiple\r\nRBridges in the group.  Such remote edge RBridges are required to\r\nmaintain all those associations (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not\r\nflip-flop among them (as would occur prior to the implementation of\r\nthis specification).  The design goals of this specification are\r\ndiscussed herein.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["LAALP","vSwitch","MC-LAG","DRNI"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7782","errata_url":null}
