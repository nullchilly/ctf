This is sub-optimal.\r\nSimilarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently\r\ndesigned without due consideration of manageability requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Operations Area has developed \"Guidelines for Considering\r\nOperations and Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions\"\r\n(RFC 5706), and those guidelines have been adopted by the Path Computation\r\nElement (PCE) Working Group.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the PCE Working Group used the recommendations contained\r\nin this document to guide authors of Internet-Drafts on the contents\r\nof \"Manageability Considerations\" sections in their work.  This\r\ndocument is retained for historic reference.  This document \r\ndefines a Historic Document for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6123","errata_url":null}
