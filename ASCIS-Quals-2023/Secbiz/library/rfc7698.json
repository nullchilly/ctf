In such an environment, a data-plane connection is\r\nswitched based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within\r\nthe optical spectrum, creating what is known as a flexible grid\r\n(flexi-grid).\r\n\r\nGiven the specific characteristics of flexi-grid optical networks and\r\ntheir associated technology, this document defines a framework and\r\nthe associated control-plane requirements for the application of the\r\nexisting GMPLS architecture and control-plane protocols to the\r\ncontrol of flexi-grid DWDM networks.  The actual extensions to the\r\nGMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["DWDM","Flexi-Grid","GMPLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7698","errata_url":null}
