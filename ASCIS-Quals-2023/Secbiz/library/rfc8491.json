This document only defines one type of\r\nMSD: Base MPLS Imposition.  However, it defines an encoding that can\r\nsupport other MSD types.  This document focuses on MSD use in a\r\nnetwork that is Segment Routing (SR) enabled, but MSD may also be\r\nuseful when SR is not enabled.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["BGP-LS","SID","MSD","IS-IS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8491","errata_url":null}
