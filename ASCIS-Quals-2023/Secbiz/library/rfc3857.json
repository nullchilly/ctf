Watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event package.  Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are approved, or are rejected.  A user can subscribe to this information, and therefore learn about changes to it.  This event package is a template-package because it can be applied to any event package, including itself.
