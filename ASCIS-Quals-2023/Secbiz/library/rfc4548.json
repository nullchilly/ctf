In the first task, this document\r\nis a partial replacement for RFC 1888 -- particularly for section 6 of\r\nRFC 1888.  In the second task, this document incorporates wording and\r\nspecifications from ITU-T Recommendation X.213 and further recommends\r\nthat IANA use the \"IETF consensus\" assignment policy in making future\r\nICP assignments.
