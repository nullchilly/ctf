That mechanism is limited to\r\nqueries for individual bindings.  In some situations individual\r\nbinding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.  This\r\ndocument expands on the Leasequery protocol, adding new query types\r\nand allowing for bulk transfer of DHCPv6 binding data via TCP.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"February 2009","keywords":["[--------]","dynamic hos configuration protocol","ipv6","dhcpv6 bindings"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7653"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5460","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5460"}
