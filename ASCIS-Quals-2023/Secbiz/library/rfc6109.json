In 2005, after two years of technical\r\ntests, the characteristics of an official electronic delivery\r\nservice, named certified electronic mail (in Italian \"Posta\r\nElettronica Certificata\") were defined, giving the system legal\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nThe design of the entire system was carried out by the National Center\r\nfor Informatics in the Public Administration of Italy (DigitPA),\r\nfollowed by efforts for the implementation and testing of the\r\nservice.  The DigitPA has given the Italian National Research Council\r\n(CNR), and in particular the Institute of Information Science and\r\nTechnologies at the CNR (ISTI), the task of running tests on\r\nproviders of the service to guarantee the correct implementation and\r\ninteroperability.  This document describes the certified email system\r\nadopted in Italy.  It represents the system as it is at the moment of\r\nwriting, following the technical regulations that were written based\r\nupon the Italian Law DPR. November 2, 2005.
