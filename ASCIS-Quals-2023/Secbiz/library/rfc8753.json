That requirement, and its relationship to\r\ntables maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the\r\npast.  This document makes adjustments to the review procedure based\r\non experience and updates IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect\r\nthose changes and to clarify the various relationships involved.  It\r\nalso makes other minor adjustments to align that document with\r\nexperience.","pub_date":"April 2020","keywords":["IDNA2008","IDN","Unicode Algorithmic Review","Unicode Code Point Review","IDNA Designated Expert"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5892"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8753","errata_url":null}
