RFC 7258\r\ndiscusses the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing\r\nIETF specifications and also recognizes that making networks\r\nunmanageable to mitigate pervasive monitoring is not an acceptable\r\noutcome: an appropriate balance is needed.  This document discusses\r\ncurrent security and network operations as well as management\r\npractices that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of\r\nencryption to help guide protocol development in support of\r\nmanageable and secure networks.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":["NETCONF","RESTCONF","Monitoring","Management","Security Management","Operations"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8404","errata_url":null}
