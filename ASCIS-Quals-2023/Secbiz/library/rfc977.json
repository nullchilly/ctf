NNTP is designed so that news    articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to    select only those items he wishes to read.  Indexing, cross-referencing,    and expiration of aged messages are also provided. This RFC suggests a    proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests    discussion and suggestions for improvements.
