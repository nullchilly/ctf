For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management is needed.  Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety\r\nof IP-based protocols.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a URI scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management.  The scheme also allows a URI\r\nto designate one or more MIB object instances.
