      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should be subject to explicitly unfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed to achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above. </t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The TCP/IP protocol suite used on today's Internet has over 30 years of accumulated research and engineering into the provisioning of QoS machinery, employed with varying success in different environments. ICN protocols like NDN <xref target="NDN" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NDN"/> and CCNx <xref target="RFC8569" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8569"/> <xref target="RFC8609" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8609"/> have an accumulated ten years of research and very little deployment. We therefore have the opportunity to either recapitulate the approaches taken with TCP/IP (e.g., Intserv <xref target="RFC2998" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2998"/> and Diffserv <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/>) or design a new architecture and associated mechanisms aligned with the properties of ICN protocols, which differ substantially from those of TCP/IP. This position paper advocates the latter approach and comprises the author's personal views on how QoS capabilities ought to be accommodated in ICN protocols like CCNx or NDN. Specifically, these protocols differ in fundamental ways from TCP/IP. The important differences are summarized in <xref target="IPvsICN" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Table 1"/>:</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">Much of this background material is tutorial and can be simply skipped by readers familiar with the long and checkered history of quality of service in packet networks. Other parts of it are polemical yet serve to illuminate the author's personal biases and technical views.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">All networking systems provide some degree of "quality of service" in that they exhibit nonzero utility when offered traffic to carry. In other words, the network is totally useless if it never delivers any of the traffic injected by applications. The term QoS is therefore more correctly applied in a more restricted sense to describe systems that control the allocation of various resources in order to achieve <em>managed unfairness</em>.  Absent explicit mechanisms to decide which traffic to treat unfairly, most systems try to achieve some form of "fairness" in the allocation of resources, optimizing the overall utility delivered to all traffic under the constraint of available resources. From this, it should be obvious that you cannot use QoS mechanisms to create or otherwise increase resource capacity! In fact, all known QoS schemes have nonzero overhead and hence may (albeit slightly) decrease the total resources available to carry user traffic.</t>

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-7">Another factor in the design and deployment of QoS is the scalability and scope over which the desired service can be achieved. Here there are two major considerations, one technical, the other economic/political:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3-8">
        <li pn="section-3-8.1">Some signaled QoS schemes, such as the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) <xref target="RFC2205" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2205"/>, maintain state in routers for each flow, which scales linearly with the number of flows. For core routers through which pass millions to billions of flows, the memory required is infeasible to provide.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-8.2">The Internet is comprised of many minimally cooperating autonomous systems <xref target="AS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AS"/>.

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-9">This document adopts a narrow definition of QoS as <em>managed unfairness</em> (see note below). However, much of the networking literature uses the term more colloquially, applying it to any mechanism that improves overall performance. One could use a different, broader definition of QoS that encompasses optimizing the allocation of network resources across all offered traffic without considering individual users' traffic. A consequence would be the need to cover whether (and how) ICN might result in better overall performance than IP under constant resource conditions, which is a much broader goal than that attempted here. The chosen narrower scope comports with the commonly understood meaning of "QoS" in the research community. Under this scope, and under constant resource constraints, the only way to provide traffic discrimination is in fact to sacrifice fairness. Readers assuming the broader context will find a large class of proven techniques to be ignored. This is intentional. Among these are seamless producer mobility schemes like <xref target="Auge2018" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Auge2018">MAP-Me</xref> and network coding of ICN data as discussed in <xref target="I-D.irtf-nwcrg-nwc-ccn-reqs" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NWC-CCN-REQS"/>.</t>
      <aside pn="section-3-10">
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3-10.1">Note: The term <em>managed unfairness</em> used to explain QoS is generally ascribed to Van Jacobson, who in talks in the late 1990s said, "[The problem we are solving is to] Give 'better' service to some at the expense of giving worse service to others. QoS fantasies to the contrary, it's a zero-sum game. In other words, QoS is <em>managed unfairness</em>."</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-11">Finally, the relationship between QoS and either accounting or billing is murky. Some schemes can accurately account for resource consumption and ascertain to which user to allocate the usage. Others cannot.

Quite extensive tutorial information may be found in a number of places, including material available from <xref target="NDNTutorials" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NDNTutorials"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-2">In NDN and CCNx, all protocol interactions operate as a two-way handshake. Named content is requested by a <em>consumer</em> via an <em>Interest message</em> that is routed hop-by-hop through a series of <em>forwarders</em> until it reaches a node that stores the requested data. This can be either the <em>producer</em> of the data or a forwarder holding a cached copy of the requested data. The content matching the name in the Interest message is returned to the requester over the <em>inverse</em> of the path traversed by the corresponding Interest.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-3">Forwarding in CCNx and NDN is <em>per-packet stateful</em>. Routing information to select next hop(s) for an Interest is obtained from a <em>Forwarding Information Base (FIB)</em>, which is similar in function to the FIB in an IP router except that it holds name prefixes rather than IP address prefixes. Conventionally, a <em>Longest Name Prefix Match (LNPM)</em> is used for lookup, although other algorithms are possible, including controlled flooding and adaptive learning based on prior history.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-4">Each Interest message leaves a trail of "breadcrumbs" as state in each forwarder. This state, held in a data structure known as a <em>Pending Interest Table (PIT)</em>, is used to forward the returning Data message to the consumer. Since the PIT constitutes per-packet state, it is therefore a large consumer of memory resources, especially in forwarders carrying high traffic loads over long Round-Trip Time (RTT) paths, and hence plays a substantial role as a QoS-controllable resource in ICN forwarders.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-5">In addition to its role in forwarding Interest messages and returning the corresponding Data messages, an ICN forwarder can also operate as a cache, optionally storing a copy of any Data messages it has seen in a local data structure known as a <em>Content Store (CS)</em>. Data in the CS may be returned in response to a matching Interest rather than forwarding the Interest further through the network to the original Producer. Both CCNx and NDN have a variety of ways to configure caching, including mechanisms to avoid both cache pollution and cache poisoning (these are clearly beyond the scope of this brief introduction).</t>

        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-3">Before moving on to QoS, it is useful to consider how congestion control works in NDN or CCNx. Unlike the IP protocol family, which relies exclusively on end-to-end congestion control (e.g., TCP <xref target="RFC0793" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC0793"/>, DCCP <xref target="RFC4340" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4340"/>, SCTP <xref target="RFC4960" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4960"/>, and QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>), CCNx and NDN can employ hop-by-hop congestion control. There is per-Interest/Data state at every hop of the path, and therefore outstanding Interests provide information that can be used to optimize resource allocation for data returning on the inverse path, such as bandwidth sharing, prioritization, and overload control. In current designs, this allocation is often done using Interest counting. By accepting one Interest packet from a downstream node, this implicitly provides a guarantee (either hard or soft) that there is sufficient bandwidth on the inverse direction of the link to send back one Data packet. A number of congestion control schemes have been developed for ICN that operate in this fashion, for example, <xref target="Wang2013" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Wang2013"/>, <xref target="Mahdian2016" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Mahdian2016"/>, <xref target="Song2018" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Song2018"/>, and <xref target="Carofiglio2012" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Carofiglio2012"/>. Other schemes, like <xref target="Schneider2016" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Schneider2016"/>, neither count nor police Interests but instead monitor queues using AQM (active queue management) to mark returning Data packets that have experienced congestion. This later class of schemes is similar to those used on IP in the sense that they depend on consumers adequately reducing their rate of Interest injection to avoid Data packet drops due to buffer overflow in forwarders. The former class of schemes is (arguably) more robust against misbehavior by consumers.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-4">Given the stochastic nature of RTTs, and the ubiquity of wireless links and encapsulation tunnels with variable bandwidth, a simple scheme that admits Interests only based on a time-invariant estimate of the returning link bandwidth will perform poorly. However, two characteristics of NDN and CCNx-like protocols can help substantially to improve the accuracy and responsiveness of the bandwidth allocation:
</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-3.2-5">
          <li pn="section-3.2-5.1" derivedCounter="1.">RTT is bounded by the inclusion of an <em>Interest Lifetime</em> in each Interest message, which puts an upper bound on the RTT uncertainty for any given Interest/Data exchange. If Interest Lifetimes are kept reasonably short (a few RTTs), the allocation of local forwarder resources do not have to deal with an arbitrarily long tail. One could in fact do a deterministic allocation on this basis, but the result would be highly pessimistic. Nevertheless, having a cutoff does improve the performance of an optimistic allocation scheme.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.2-5.2" derivedCounter="2.">A congestion marking scheme like that used in Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) can be used to mark returning Data packets if the inverse link starts experiencing long queue occupancy or other congestion indication. Unlike TCP/IP, where the rate adjustment can only be done end-to-end, this feedback is usable immediately by the downstream ICN forwarder, and the Interest shaping rate is lowered after a single link RTT. This may allow rate adjustment schemes that are less pessimistic than the Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) scheme with .5 multiplier that is commonly used on TCP/IP networks. It also allows the rate adjustments to be spread more accurately among the Interest/Data flows traversing a link sending congestion signals.</li>

First, the number of equivalence classes that can be simultaneously tracked in a network element is bounded by both memory and processing capacity to do the necessary lookups. One can allow very fine-grained equivalence classes but not be able to employ them globally because of scaling limits of core routers. That means it is wise to either restrict the range of equivalence classes or allow them to be <em>aggregated</em>, trading off accuracy in policing traffic against ability to scale.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-6">Second, the flexibility of expressible treatments can be tightly constrained by both protocol encoding and algorithmic limitations. The ability to encode the treatment requests in the protocol can be limited -- as it is for IP where there are only six of the Type of Service (TOS) bits available for Diffserv treatments. However, an equal or more important issue is whether there are practical traffic policing, queuing, and pacing algorithms that can be combined to support a rich set of QoS treatments.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-7">The two considerations above in combination can easily be substantially more expressive than what can be achieved in practice with the available number of queues on real network interfaces or the amount of per-packet computation needed to enqueue or dequeue a packet.

The IP address (or prefix) can only separate traffic by topology to the granularity of hosts and cannot express actual computational instances nor sets of data. Ports give some degree of per-instance demultiplexing, but this tends to be both coarse and ephemeral, while confounding the demultiplexing function with the assignment of QoS treatments to particular subsets of the data. Some degree of finer granularity is possible with IPv6 by exploiting the ability to use up to 64 bits of address for classifying traffic. In fact, the Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN) project <xref target="I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="HICN"/>, while adopting the request-response model of CCNx, uses IPv6 addresses as the available namespace, and IPv6 packets (plus "fake" TCP headers) as the wire format.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-1">In ICN, QoS is not pre-bound to network topology since names are non-topological, unlike unicast IP addresses. This allows QoS to be applied to multi-destination and multipath environments in a straightforward manner, rather than requiring either multicast with coarse class-based scheduling or complex signaling like that in RSVP Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) <xref target="RFC3209" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3209"/> that is needed to make point-to-multipoint Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) work.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-2">Because of IP's stateless forwarding model, complicated by the ubiquity of asymmetric routes, any flow-based QoS requires state that is decoupled from the actual arrival of traffic and hence must be maintained, at least as soft state, even during quiescent periods. Intserv, for example, requires flow signaling on the order of O(number of flows). ICN, even worst case, requires order of O(number of active Interest/Data exchanges), since state can be instantiated on arrival of an Interest and removed (perhaps lazily) once the data has been returned.</t>

In contrast, NDN or CCNx forwarding allows all link resource allocation to occur as part of Interest forwarding, potentially simplifying things considerably.

This can recover cache space more quickly and at lower overhead than pure per-object replacement when a cache is under extreme pressure and in danger of thrashing.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">Based on the observations made in the earlier sections, this summary section captures the author's ideas for clear and actionable architectural principles for incorporating QoS machinery into ICN protocols like NDN and CCNx. Hopefully, they can guide further work and focus effort on portions of the giant design space for QoS that have the best trade-offs in terms of flexibility, simplicity, and deployability.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2"><strong>Define equivalence classes using the name hierarchy rather than creating an independent traffic class definition</strong>. This directly associates the specification of equivalence classes of traffic with the structure of the application namespace. It can allow hierarchical decomposition of equivalence classes in a natural way because of the way hierarchical ICN names are constructed. Two practical mechanisms are presented in <xref target="I-D.moiseenko-icnrg-flowclass" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FLOWCLASS"/> with different trade-offs between security and the ability to aggregate flows. Either the prefix-based mechanism (the equivalence class component count (EC3) scheme) or the explicit name component-based mechanism (the equivalence class name component type (ECNCT) scheme), or both, could be adopted as the part of the QoS architecture for defining equivalence classes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3"><strong> Put consumers in control of link and forwarding resource allocation</strong>. Base all link buffering and forwarding (both memory and CPU) resource allocations on Interest arrivals. This is attractive because it provides early congestion feedback to consumers and allows scheduling the reverse link direction for carrying the matching data in advance. It makes enforcement of QoS treatments a single-ended (i.e., at the consumer) rather than a double-ended problem and can avoid wasting resources on fetching data that will be dropped when it arrives at a bottleneck link.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4"><strong>Allow producers to influence the allocation of cache resources</strong>. Producers want to affect caching decisions in order to do the following:
</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-7-5">

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-6"> 
For caching to be effective, individual Data objects in an equivalence class need to have similar treatment; otherwise, well-known cache-thrashing pathologies due to self-interference emerge. Producers have the most direct control over caching policies through the caching directives in Data messages. It therefore makes sense to put the producer, rather than the consumer or network operator, in charge of specifying these equivalence classes.</t>

        <li pn="section-7-11.3">A QoS treatment indicating that a mobile consumer will likely incur a mobility event within an RTT (or a few RTTs).

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-12"><strong>Give network operators the ability to match customer SLAs to cache resource availability</strong>. Network operators, whether closely tied administratively to producer or consumer, or constituting an independent transit administration, provide the storage resources in the ICN forwarders. Therefore, they are the ultimate arbiters of how the cache resources are managed. In addition to any local policies they may enforce, the cache behavior from the QoS standpoint emerges from the mapping of producer-specified equivalence classes onto cache space availability, including whether cache entries are treated individually or fate-shared. Forwarders also determine the mapping of consumer-specified QoS treatments to the precedence used for retaining Data objects in the cache.</t>

While it is true that one does not necessarily need a separate signaling protocol like RSVP given the state carried in the ICN data plane by forwarders, simple QoS treatments applied per Interest/Data exchanges lack some potentially important capabilities. Intserv's richer QoS capabilities may be of value, especially if they can be provided in ICN at lower complexity and protocol overhead than Intserv plus RSVP.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-2">There are three key capabilities missing from Diffserv-like QoS treatments, no matter how sophisticated they may be in describing the desired treatment for a given equivalence class of traffic. Intserv-like QoS provides all of these:

This is done through parameters like average rate, peak rate, and maximum burst size. The parameters are encapsulated in a data structure called a "TSPEC", which can be placed in whatever protocol needs the information (in the case of TCP/IP Intserv, this is RSVP).</li>
          <li pn="section-7.1-3.2" derivedCounter="2.">The ability to perform <strong>admission control</strong>, where the element requesting the QoS treatment can know <em>before</em> introducing traffic whether the network elements have agreed to provide the requested traffic treatment. An important side effect of providing this assurance is that the network elements install state that allows the forwarding and queuing machinery to police and shape the traffic in a way that provides a sufficient degree of <em>isolation</em> from the dynamic behavior of other traffic. Depending on the admission-control mechanism, it may or may not be possible to explicitly release that state when the application no longer needs the QoS treatment.</li>
          <li pn="section-7.1-3.3" derivedCounter="3.">The ability to specify the permissible <strong>degree of divergence</strong> in the actual traffic handling from the requested handling. Intserv provides two choices here: the <em>controlled load</em> service and the <em>guaranteed</em> service.

The latter conforms to the TSPEC deterministically, at the obvious expense of demanding extremely conservative resource allocation.</li>
        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-4">Given the limited applicability of these capabilities in today's Internet, the author does not take any position as to whether any of these Intserv-like capabilities are needed for ICN to be successful. However, a few things seem important to consider. The following paragraphs speculate about the consequences of incorporating these features into the CCNx or NDN protocol architectures.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-5">Superficially, it would be quite straightforward to accommodate Intserv-equivalent traffic descriptions in CCNx or NDN. One could define a new TLV for the Interest message to carry a TSPEC. A forwarder encountering this, together with a QoS treatment request (e.g., as proposed in <xref target="qostreatments" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3"/>), could associate the traffic specification with the corresponding equivalence class derived from the name in the Interest. This would allow the forwarder to create state that not only would apply to the returning Data for that Interest when being queued on the downstream interface but also be maintained as soft state across multiple Interest/Data exchanges to drive policing and shaping algorithms at per-flow granularity. The cost in Interest message overhead would be modest; however, the complications associated with managing different traffic specifications in different Interests for the same equivalence class might be substantial. Of course, all the scalability considerations with maintaining per-flow state also come into play.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-6">Similarly, it would be equally straightforward to have a way to express the degree of divergence capability that Intserv provides through its controlled load and guaranteed service definitions. This could either be packaged with the traffic specification or encoded separately.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-7">In contrast to the above, performing admission control for ICN flows is likely to be just as heavyweight as it is with IP using RSVP. The dynamic multipath, multi-destination forwarding model of ICN makes performing admission control particularly tricky. Just to illustrate:

          <li pn="section-7.1-8.2">As with point-to-multipoint complexities when using RSVP for MPLS-TE, state has to be installed to multiple producers over multiple paths before an admission-control algorithm can commit the resources and say "yes" to a consumer needing admission-control capabilities.</li>
          <li pn="section-7.1-8.3">Knowing when to remove admission-control state is difficult in the absence of a heavyweight resource reservation protocol. Soft state timeout may or may not be an adequate answer.</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-9">	Despite the challenges above, it may be possible to craft an admission-control scheme for ICN that achieves the desired QoS goals of applications without the invention and deployment of a complex, separate admission-control signaling protocol.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   Deeply embedded in some ICN architectures, especially Named Data
   Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is the notion
   of flow balance.  This captures the idea that there is a one-to-one
   correspondence between requests for data, carried in Interest
   messages, and the responses with the requested data object, carried
   in Data messages.  This has a number of highly beneficial properties
   for flow and congestion control in networks, as well as some
   desirable security properties.  For example, neither legitimate users
   nor attackers are able to inject large amounts of un-requested data
   into the network.

   Existing congestion control approaches however have a difficult time
   dealing effectively with a widely varying MTU of ICN data messages,
   because the protocols allow a dynamic range of 1-64K bytes.  Since
   Interest messages are used to allocate the reverse link bandwidth for
   returning Data, there is large uncertainty in how to allocate that
   bandwidth.  Unfortunately, most current congestion control schemes in
   CCNx and NDN only count Interest messages and have no idea how much
   data is involved that could congest the inverse link.  This document
   proposes a method to maintain flow balance by accommodating the wide
   dynamic range in Data message size.

   (hICN) architecture for IPv6.  The specifications describe a way to
   implement information-networking functionalities into IPv6.  The
   objective is to use IPv6 without creating overlays with a new packet
   format as an additional encapsulation.  The intent of the present
   design is to introduce some IPv6 routers in the network with
   additional packet processing operations to implement ICN functions.
   Moreover, the current design is tightly integrated into IPv6 to allow
   easy interconnection to IPv6 networks with the additional design
   objective to exploit existing IPv6 protocols as much as possible as
   they are, or extend them where needed.

              <t indent="0">This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv and recommends how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class, but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply them consistently.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309.  It describes the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of broader applications.</t>
              <t indent="0">SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP.  It offers the following services to its users:</t>
              <t indent="0">--  acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data,</t>
              <t indent="0">--  data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,</t>
              <t indent="0">--  sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages,</t>
              <t indent="0">--  optional bundling of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and</t>
              <t indent="0">--  network-level fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association.</t>
              <t indent="0"> The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration. QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm.</t>
