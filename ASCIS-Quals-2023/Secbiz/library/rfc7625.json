For the\r\nimplementation described in this document, the infrastructure has\r\nbeen separated into two strata: one for the \"Hard Pipes\", called the\r\n\"Hard Pipe Stratum\", and one for the normal IP\/MPLS traffic, called\r\nthe \"Normal IP\/MPLS Stratum\".\r\n\r\nThis document introduces the concept of a Hard Pipe -- an MPLS Label\r\nSwitched Path (LSP) or a pseudowire (PW) with a bandwidth that is\r\nguaranteed and can neither be exceeded nor infringed upon.\r\n\r\nThe Hard Pipe stratum does not use statistical multiplexing; for the\r\nLSPs and PWs set up within this stratum, the bandwidth is guaranteed\r\nend to end.\r\n\r\nThe document does not specify any new protocol or procedures.  It\r\ndoes explain how the MPLS standards implementation has been deployed\r\nand operated to meet the requirements from operators that offer\r\ntraditional Virtual Leased Line (VLL) services.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7625","errata_url":null}
