To do that,\r\nextensions to the current PMIPv6 protocol are proposed.  These\r\nextensions are not only applicable to the base solution for multicast\r\nsupport in Proxy Mobile IPv6, but they can also be applied to other\r\nsolutions developed to avoid the tunnel convergence problem.\r\nFurthermore, these extensions are also independent of the role played\r\nby the mobile access gateway within the multicast network (acting as\r\neither multicast listener discovery proxy or multicast router).","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["PMIPv6","Proxy Mobile IPv6","multicast","handover","SIAL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7161","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7161"}
