Servers vend an\r\narbitrary number of session tickets to clients, at their discretion,\r\nupon connection establishment.  Clients store and use tickets when\r\nresuming future connections.  This document describes a mechanism by\r\nwhich clients can specify the desired number of tickets needed for\r\nfuture connections.  This extension aims to provide a means for\r\nservers to determine the number of tickets to generate in order to\r\nreduce ticket waste while simultaneously priming clients for future\r\nconnection attempts.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["TLS","Tickets"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9149","errata_url":null}
