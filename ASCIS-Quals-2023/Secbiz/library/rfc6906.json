A profile is defined not to alter the\r\nsemantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients\r\nto learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions,\r\nextensions) that are associated with the resource representation, in\r\naddition to those defined by the media type and possibly other\r\nmechanisms.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":["application profile","profile identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6906","errata_url":null}
