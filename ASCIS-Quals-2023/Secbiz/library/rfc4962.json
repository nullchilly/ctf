The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and\r\nsolutions that include AAA key management protocols.  Given the\r\ncomplexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key\r\nmanagement algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost\r\ncertainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in\r\nthe area to be designing their own key management algorithms and\r\nprotocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)\r\nprotocols.  The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting\r\npublication as IETF RFCs.  Further, these guidelines will be useful to other\r\nstandards development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["[--------|b]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0132"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4962","errata_url":null}
