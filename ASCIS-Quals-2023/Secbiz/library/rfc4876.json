A set of attribute types and an\r\nobject class are proposed.  In the proposed use case, directory user\r\nagents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory data\r\nlocation and access parameters for specific services they support.\r\nIn addition, in the proposed use case, attribute and object class\r\nmapping allows DUAs to reconfigure their expected (default) schema to\r\nmatch that of the end user's environment.  This document is intended\r\nto be a skeleton for future documents that describe configuration of\r\nspecific DUA services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2007","keywords":["ldap","schema","profile","configuration","nameservice","nss","pam_ldap","nss_ldap","rfc2307","rfc 2307"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4876","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4876"}
