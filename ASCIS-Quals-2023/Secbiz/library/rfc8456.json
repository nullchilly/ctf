The SDN Controller is a core component in the SDN\r\narchitecture that controls the behavior of the network.  SDN\r\nControllers have been implemented with many varying designs in order\r\nto achieve their intended network functionality.  Hence, the authors\r\nof this document have taken the approach of considering an SDN\r\nController to be a black box, defining the methodology in a manner\r\nthat is agnostic to protocols and network services supported by\r\ncontrollers.  This document provides a method for measuring the\r\nperformance of all controller implementations.","pub_date":"October 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8456","errata_url":null}
