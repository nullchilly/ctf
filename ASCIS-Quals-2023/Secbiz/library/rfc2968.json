The Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) is designed to facilitate the creation not only of query referral indexes, but also of meshes of (loosely) affiliated referral indexes.  The purpose of such a mesh of servers is to implement some kind of distributed sharing of indexing and\/or searching tasks across different servers.  So far, the TISDAG (Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways) project has focused on creating a single referral index; the obvious next step is to integrate that into a larger set of interoperating services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
