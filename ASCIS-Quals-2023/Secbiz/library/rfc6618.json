The security association (SA) between\r\nan MN and the HA is established using Internet Key Exchange Protocol\r\n(IKE) version 1 or 2.  The security model specified for Mobile IPv6,\r\nwhich relies on IKE\/IPsec, requires interaction between the Mobile\r\nIPv6 protocol component and the IKE\/IPsec module of the IP stack.\r\nThis document proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile\r\nIPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6, which relies on Transport Layer\r\nSecurity for establishing keying material and other bootstrapping\r\nparameters required to protect Mobile IPv6 signaling and data traffic\r\nbetween the MN and HA.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["Mobile IPv6","Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6618","errata_url":null}
