It provides a list of\r\nRTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR), Receiver Report (RR), and\r\nExtended Report (XR) metrics, which may need to be supported by RTP\r\nimplementations in some diverse environments.  It lists a set of identifiers\r\nfor the WebRTC's statistics API.  These identifiers are a set of RTCP SR, RR,\r\nand XR metrics related to the transport of multimedia flows.","pub_date":"September 2018","keywords":["Web real-time communication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8451","errata_url":null}
