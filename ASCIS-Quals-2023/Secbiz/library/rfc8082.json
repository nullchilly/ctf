In\r\nparticular, a decoder refresh point needs to be sent by a media\r\nsender when a FIR is received on any layer of the layered bitstream,\r\nregardless of whether those layers are being sent in a single or in\r\nmultiple RTP flows.  The other payload-specific feedback messages\r\ndefined in RFC 5104 and RFC 4585 (which was updated by RFC 5506) have\r\nalso been analyzed, and no corresponding shortcomings have been\r\nfound.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["Layered Codec","Full Intra Request","FIR","Decoder Refresh Point"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5104"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8082","errata_url":null}
