The document outlines the principal gains in\r\nterms of increased throughput, reduced delay, and other benefits when\r\nECN is used over a network path that includes equipment that supports\r\nCongestion Experienced (CE) marking.  It also discusses challenges\r\nfor successful deployment of ECN.  It does not propose new algorithms\r\nto use ECN nor does it describe the details of implementation of ECN\r\nin endpoint devices (Internet hosts), routers, or other network\r\ndevices.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["ecn","aqm","sctp","tcp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8087","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8087"}
