Singh"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"25","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Audio\/Video Transport Core Maintenance","abstract":"The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,\r\nvideo conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications\r\nare often run on best-effort UDP\/IP networks.  If congestion control\r\nis not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can\r\nlead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the\r\nuser's multimedia experience.  The congestion control algorithm acts\r\nas a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive\r\nresources and protecting the network from overload.  At the time of\r\nthis writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions,\r\nthere is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive\r\nRTP flows.\r\n\r\nThis document does not propose a congestion control algorithm.  It\r\ninstead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions\r\nunder which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to\r\nprotect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that,\r\nin the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications\r\nrunning on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without\r\ntriggering these circuit breakers.  To avoid triggering the RTP\r\ncircuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms\r\ndefined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these\r\nRTP circuit breaker algorithms.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3550"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8083","errata_url":null}
