It provides isolation for\r\nlow-rate traffic such as DNS, web, and videoconferencing traffic.  It\r\nimproves utilisation across the networking fabric, especially for\r\nbidirectional traffic, by keeping queue lengths short, and it can be\r\nimplemented in a memory- and CPU-efficient fashion across a wide\r\nrange of hardware.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["bufferbloat","aqm","fq_codel","fq-codel"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8290","errata_url":null}
