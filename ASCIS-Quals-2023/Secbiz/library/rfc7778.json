This memo provides a brief overview of\r\nthe architecture of these networks (both access and core networks)\r\nand current QoS mechanisms and then discusses how congestion exposure\r\nconcepts could be applied.  Based on this discussion, this memo\r\nsuggests a set of requirements for ConEx mechanisms that particularly\r\napply to these mobile networks.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["congestion exposure","mobile communications"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7778","errata_url":null}
