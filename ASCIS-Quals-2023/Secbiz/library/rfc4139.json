These include support\r\nfor requesting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections, including\r\nSynchronous Optical Network (SONET)\/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\r\n(SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\r\n\r\nThis document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS\r\nsuite of protocols.  It identifies the features to be covered by the\r\nGMPLS signaling protocol to support the capabilities of an\r\nAutomatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).  This document provides\r\na problem statement and additional requirements for the GMPLS\r\nsignaling protocol to support the ASON functionality.
