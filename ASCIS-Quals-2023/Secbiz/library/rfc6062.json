This extension allows a TURN client to request TCP\r\nallocations, and defines new requests and indications for the TURN\r\nserver to open and accept TCP connections with the client\\'s peers.\r\nTURN and this extension both purposefully restrict the ways in which\r\nthe relayed address can be used.  In particular, it prevents users\r\nfrom running general-purpose servers from ports obtained from the\r\nTURN server.
