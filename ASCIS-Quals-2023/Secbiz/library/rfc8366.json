Other YANG-derived formats are possible.  The\r\nvoucher artifact is normally generated by the pledge's manufacturer\r\n(i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA)).\r\n\r\nThis document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other\r\ndocuments to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["voucher","autonomic networking","autonomous operation","self-management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8366","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8366"}
