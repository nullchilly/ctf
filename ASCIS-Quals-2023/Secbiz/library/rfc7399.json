The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with\r\nthe introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM) in\r\nRFC 5623 and generalized to Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) in RFC 6805.\r\n\r\nThese three architectural views of PCE deliberately leave some key\r\nquestions unanswered, especially with respect to the interactions\r\nbetween architectural components.  This document draws out those\r\nquestions and discusses them in an architectural context with\r\nreference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and\r\nrecent IETF efforts.\r\n\r\nThis document does not update the architecture documents and does not\r\ndefine how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however,\r\nsuggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide\r\nadvanced PCE function.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["SDN","Software Defined Networking","H-PCE","Hierarchical PCE","VNTM","Virtual Network Topology Manager","ABNO","Application-Based Network Operation","TE","Traffic Engineering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7399","errata_url":null}
