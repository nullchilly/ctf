An\r\nextension based on this framework compresses the payload data portion\r\nof WebSocket data messages on a per-message basis using parameters\r\nnegotiated during the opening handshake.  This framework provides a\r\ngeneral method for applying a compression algorithm to the contents\r\nof WebSocket messages.  Each compression algorithm has to be defined\r\nin a document defining the extension by specifying the parameter\r\nnegotiation and the payload transformation algorithm in detail.  This\r\ndocument also specifies one specific compression extension using the\r\nDEFLATE algorithm.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["DEFLATE","LZ77"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7692","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7692"}
