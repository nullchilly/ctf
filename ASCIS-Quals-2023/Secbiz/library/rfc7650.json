The CoAP Usage\r\nprovides the functionality to federate Wireless Sensor Networks\r\n(WSNs) in a peer-to-peer fashion.  The CoAP Usage for RELOAD allows\r\nCoAP nodes to store resources in a RELOAD peer-to-peer overlay,\r\nprovides a lookup service, and enables the use of RELOAD overlay as a\r\ncache for sensor data.  This functionality is implemented in the\r\nRELOAD overlay itself, without the use of centralized servers.  The\r\nRELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection\r\nbetween nodes through which CoAP messages are exchanged.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["CoAP","RELOAD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7650","errata_url":null}
