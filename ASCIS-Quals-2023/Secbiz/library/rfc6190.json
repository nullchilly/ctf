The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or\r\nmore Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload,\r\nas well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets.\r\nFurthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single\r\nas well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new\r\nmedia subtype name \"H264-SVC\", but is still backward compatible to RFC\r\n6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream,\r\nmust use the H.264 media subtype name (\"H264\") and the packetization\r\nmethod specified in RFC 6184.  The payload format has wide\r\napplicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and\r\nhigh-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.
