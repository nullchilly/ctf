Many of the fundamental, long-term improvements to the\r\narchitecture, security, end-to-end protocols and management of the\r\nInternet originate in the related academic research communities.\r\nEven shorter-term, more commercially driven extensions are oftentimes\r\nderived from academic research.  When interoperability is required,\r\nthe IETF standardizes such new technology.  Timely and relevant\r\nstandardization benefits from continuous input and review from the\r\nacademic research community.\r\n\r\nFor an individual researcher, it can however be quite puzzling how to\r\nbegin to most effectively participate in the IETF and arguably to a\r\nmuch lesser degree, the IRTF.  The interactions in the IETF are\r\nmuch different than those in academic conferences, and effective\r\nparticipation follows different rules.  The goal of this document is\r\nto highlight such differences and provide a rough guideline that will\r\nhopefully enable researchers new to the IETF to become successful\r\ncontributors more quickly.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6417","errata_url":null}
