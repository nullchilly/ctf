Many standards development organizations (SDOs), open-source\r\nsoftware projects, vendors, and users are using YANG to develop and\r\npublish YANG modules for a wide variety of applications.  At the same\r\ntime, there is currently no well-known terminology to categorize\r\nvarious types of YANG modules.\r\n\r\nA consistent terminology would help with the categorization of YANG\r\nmodules, assist in the analysis of the YANG data modeling efforts in\r\nthe IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-\r\nrelated discussions between the different groups.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to\r\nsupport consistent classification of YANG modules.","pub_date":"July 2017","keywords":["service","element","standard","vendor","user","controller","orchestrator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8199","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8199"}
