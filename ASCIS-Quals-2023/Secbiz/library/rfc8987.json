These problems can\r\nprevent successful delegation and result in routing failures. To\r\naddress these problems, this document provides necessary functional\r\nrequirements for operating DHCPv6 relays with prefix delegation.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that any network operator using DHCPv6 prefix\r\ndelegation with relays ensure that these requirements are followed on\r\ntheir networks.","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":["Prefix Delegation","DHCPv6 relay","Delegating router","Requesting router","Delegating relay"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8987","errata_url":null}
