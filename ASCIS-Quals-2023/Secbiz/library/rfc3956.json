For Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), this can be seen as a specification of a group-to-RP mapping mechanism.  This allows an easy deployment of scalable inter-domain multicast and simplifies the intra-domain multicast configuration as well.  This memo updates the addressing format presented in RFC 3306.
