Tag URIs (also known as \"tags\") are designed to be unique\r\nacross space and time while being tractable to humans.  They are\r\ndistinct from most other URIs in that they have no authoritative\r\nresolution mechanism.  A tag may be used purely as an entity\r\nidentifier.  Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the\r\ncommon practice of using \"http\" URIs as identifiers for\r\nnon-HTTP-accessible resources.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2005","keywords":["uniform resource identifier","entity identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4151","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4151"}
