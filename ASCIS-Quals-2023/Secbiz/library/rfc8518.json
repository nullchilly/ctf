This document\r\nprovides explicit inequalities that can be used to evaluate neighbors\r\nas potential alternates for MHPs.  It also provides detailed criteria\r\nfor evaluating potential alternates for external prefixes advertised\r\nby OSPF ASBRs.  This document updates Section 6 of RFC 5286 by\r\nexpanding some of the routing aspects.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["LFA","Multi-homed Prefix","IGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5286"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8518","errata_url":null}
