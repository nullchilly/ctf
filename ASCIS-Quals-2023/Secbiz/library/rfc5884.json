LSP Ping is an existing\r\nmechanism for detecting MPLS data plane failures and for verifying\r\nthe MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.  BFD can be used\r\nfor the former, but not for the latter.  However, the control plane\r\nprocessing required for BFD Control packets is relatively smaller\r\nthan the processing required for LSP Ping messages.  A combination of\r\nLSP Ping and BFD can be used to provide faster data plane failure\r\ndetection and\/or make it possible to provide such detection on a\r\ngreater number of LSPs.  This document describes the applicability of\r\nBFD in relation to LSP Ping for this application.  It also describes\r\nprocedures for using BFD in this environment.
