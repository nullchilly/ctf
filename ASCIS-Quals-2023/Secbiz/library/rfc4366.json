It provides both\r\ngeneric extension mechanisms for the TLS handshake client and server\r\nhellos, and specific extensions using these generic mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe extensions may be used by TLS clients and servers.  The\r\nextensions are backwards compatible: communication is possible\r\nbetween TLS clients that support the extensions and TLS\r\nservers that do not support the extensions, and vice versa.
