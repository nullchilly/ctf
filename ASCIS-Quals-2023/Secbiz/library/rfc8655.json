Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources\r\nfor individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the\r\nintermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit\r\nroutes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the\r\nnetwork topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets\r\nover time and\/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in\r\nspite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and\r\ndelivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time-\r\nSensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.","pub_date":"October 2019","keywords":["TSN","Bounded Latency","Reliable Networking","Available Networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8655","errata_url":null}
