This option can be\r\nused by the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway for\r\nnegotiating IPv4 traffic offload policy for a mobility session.\r\nBased on the negotiated IPv4 traffic offload policy, a mobile access\r\ngateway can selectively offload some of the IPv4 traffic flows in the\r\naccess network instead of tunneling back to the local mobility anchor\r\nin the home network.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6909","errata_url":null}
