      <t pn="section-1-1">Signaling the need for help to defend against an active distributed
      denial-of-service (DDoS) attack requires a common understanding of
      mechanisms and roles among the parties coordinating a defensive
      response. The signaling layer and supplementary messaging are the focus
      of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS). DOTS defines a method of
      coordinating defensive measures among willing peers to mitigate attacks
      quickly and efficiently, enabling hybrid attack responses coordinated
      locally at or near the target of an active attack, or anywhere in path
      between attack sources and target. Sample DOTS use cases are elaborated

        a single administrative domain. DOTS is generally assumed to be most

          <li pn="section-1.3-2.1">All domains in which DOTS is deployed are assumed to offer the
          required connectivity between DOTS agents and any intermediary
          network elements, but the architecture imposes no additional
          limitations on the form of connectivity.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.2">Congestion and resource exhaustion are intended outcomes of a
          DDoS attack <xref target="RFC4732" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4732"/>. Some
          operators may utilize non-impacted paths or networks for
	  DOTS.  However,
          in general, conditions should be assumed to be hostile, and DOTS must
          be able to function in all circumstances, including when the
          signaling path is significantly impaired. Congestion control
          requirements are discussed in <xref target="RFC8612" sectionFormat="of" section="3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-3" derivedContent="RFC8612"/>. The DOTS signal channel defined in <xref target="RFC8782" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8782"/> is designed to be extremely
          resilient under extremely hostile network conditions, and it
	  provides
          continued contact between DOTS agents even as DDoS attack traffic
          saturates the link.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.3">There is no universal DDoS attack scale threshold triggering a
          coordinated response across administrative domains. A network domain
          administrator or service or application owner may arbitrarily set
          attack scale threshold triggers, or manually send requests for
          mitigation.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.4">Mitigation requests may be sent to one or more upstream DOTS
          servers based on criteria determined by DOTS client administrators
          and the underlying network configuration. The number of DOTS servers
          with which a given DOTS client has established communications is
          determined by local policy and is deployment specific. For example,
          a DOTS client of a multihomed network may support built-in policies
          to establish DOTS relationships with DOTS servers located upstream
          of each interconnection link.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.5">The mitigation capacity and/or capability of domains receiving
          requests for coordinated attack response is opaque to the domains
          sending the request. The domain receiving the DOTS client signal may
          or may not have sufficient capacity or capability to filter any or
          all DDoS attack traffic directed at a target. In either case, the
          upstream DOTS server may redirect a request to another DOTS
          server. Redirection may be local to the redirecting DOTS server's
          domain or may involve a third-party domain.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.6">DOTS client and server signals, as well as messages sent through
          the data channel, are sent across any transit networks with the same
          probability of delivery as any other traffic between the DOTS client
          domain and the DOTS server domain. Any encapsulation required for
          successful delivery is left untouched by transit network
          elements. DOTS servers and DOTS clients cannot assume any preferential
          treatment of DOTS signals. Such preferential treatment may be
          available in some deployments (e.g., intra-domain scenarios), and
          the DOTS architecture does not preclude its use when
          available. However, DOTS itself does not address how that may be
          done.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.3-2.7">The architecture allows for, but does not assume, the presence
          of Quality-of-Service (QoS) policy agreements between DOTS-enabled
          peer networks or local QoS prioritization aimed at ensuring delivery
          of DOTS messages between DOTS agents. QoS is an operational

      <t pn="section-2-3">A simple example instantiation of the DOTS architecture could be an
      enterprise as the attack target for a volumetric DDoS attack and an
      upstream DDoS mitigation service as the mitigator. The service provided
      by the mitigator is called "DDoS mitigation service". The enterprise
      (attack target) is connected to the Internet via a link that is getting
      saturated, and the enterprise suspects it is under DDoS attack.

      The enterprise has a DOTS client, which obtains information about the
      DDoS attack and signals the DOTS server for help in mitigating the
      attack. In turn, the DOTS server invokes one or more mitigators, which
      are tasked with mitigating the actual DDoS attack and, hence, aim to
      suppress the attack traffic while allowing valid traffic to reach the
      attack target.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">The scope of the DOTS specifications is the interfaces between the
      DOTS client and DOTS server. The interfaces to the attack target and the
      mitigator are out of scope of DOTS. Similarly, the operation of both the
      attack target and the mitigator is out of scope of DOTS. Thus, DOTS
      specifies neither how an attack target decides it is under DDoS attack
      nor does DOTS specify how a mitigator may actually mitigate such an
      attack. A DOTS client's request for mitigation is advisory in nature
      and might not lead to any mitigation at all, depending on the DOTS
      server domain's capacity and willingness to mitigate on behalf of the
      DOTS client domain.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-5">The DOTS client may be provided with a list of DOTS servers, each
      associated with one or more IP addresses. These addresses may or may not
      be of the same address family. The DOTS client establishes one or more
      sessions by connecting to the provided DOTS server addresses.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-6">As illustrated in <xref target="fig-interfaces" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>,
      there are two interfaces between a DOTS server and a DOTS client: a
      signal channel and (optionally) a data channel.</t>

      <t pn="section-2-8">The primary purpose of the signal channel is for a DOTS client to ask
      a DOTS server for help in mitigating an attack and for the DOTS server
      to inform the DOTS client about the status of such mitigation. The DOTS
      client does this by sending a client signal that contains information
      about the attack target(s). The client signal may also include telemetry
      information about the attack, if the DOTS client has such information
      available. In turn, the DOTS server sends a server signal to inform the
      DOTS client of whether it will honor the mitigation request. Assuming it
      will, the DOTS server initiates attack mitigation and periodically
      informs the DOTS client about the status of the mitigation.  Similarly,
      the DOTS client periodically informs the DOTS server about the client's
      status, which, at a minimum, provides client (attack target) health
      information; it should also include efficacy information about the
      attack mitigation as it is now seen by the client. At some point, the
      DOTS client may decide to terminate the server-side attack mitigation,
      which it indicates to the DOTS server over the signal channel. A
      mitigation may also be terminated if a DOTS client-specified mitigation
      lifetime is exceeded. Note that the signal channel may need to operate
      over a link that is experiencing a DDoS attack and, hence, is subject to
      severe packet loss and high latency.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-9">While DOTS is able to request mitigation with just the signal
      channel, the addition of the DOTS data channel provides for additional,
      more efficient capabilities. The primary purpose of the data channel is
      to support DOTS-related configuration and policy information exchange
      between the DOTS client and the DOTS server. Examples of such
      information include, but are not limited to:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" pn="section-2-10">
        <li pn="section-2-10.1">Creating identifiers, such as names or aliases, for resources for
        which mitigation may be requested. Such identifiers may then be used
        in subsequent signal channel exchanges to refer more efficiently to
        the resources under attack. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" pn="section-2-11">
        <li pn="section-2-11.1">Drop-list management, which enables a DOTS client to inform the

        <li pn="section-2-11.2">Accept-list management, which enables a DOTS client to inform the
        DOTS server about sources from which traffic is always accepted.</li>
        <li pn="section-2-11.3">Filter management, which enables a DOTS client to install or

      </ul>
      <t pn="section-2-12">Note that, while it is possible to exchange the above information
      before, during, or after a DDoS attack, DOTS requires reliable delivery
      of this information and does not provide any special means for ensuring
      timely delivery of it during an attack. In practice, this means that
      DOTS deployments should rely on such information being exchanged only
      under normal traffic conditions.</t>
      <section anchor="operations" numbered="true" toc="include" removeInRFC="false" pn="section-2.1">
        <name slugifiedName="name-dots-operations">DOTS Operations</name>
        <t pn="section-2.1-1">DOTS does not prescribe any specific deployment models; however,
        DOTS is designed with some specific requirements around the different
        DOTS agents and their relationships.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-2">First of all, a DOTS agent belongs to a domain that has an identity
        that can be authenticated and authorized. DOTS agents communicate
        with each other over a mutually authenticated signal channel and
        (optionally) data channel. However, before they can do so, a service
        relationship needs to be established between them.  The details and
        means by which this is done is outside the scope of DOTS; however, an
        example would be for an enterprise A (DOTS client) to sign up for DDoS
        service from provider B (DOTS server). This would establish a
        (service) relationship between the two that enables enterprise A's
        DOTS client to establish a signal channel with provider B's DOTS
        server. A and B will authenticate each other, and B can verify that A
        is authorized for its service.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-3">From an operational and design point of view, DOTS assumes that the
        above relationship is established prior to a request for DDoS attack
        mitigation. In particular, it is assumed that bidirectional
        communication is possible at this time between the DOTS client and
        DOTS server. Furthermore, it is assumed that additional service
        provisioning, configuration, and information exchange can be performed
        by use of the data channel if operationally required. It is not until
        this point that the mitigation service is available for use.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-4">Once the mutually authenticated signal channel has been
        established, it will remain active. This is done to increase the
        likelihood that the DOTS client can signal the DOTS server for help
        when the attack target is being flooded, and similarly raise the
        probability that DOTS server signals reach the client regardless of
        inbound link congestion.  This does not necessarily imply that the
        attack target and the DOTS client have to be co-located in the same
        administrative domain, but it is expected to be a common scenario.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-5">DDoS mitigation with the help of an upstream mitigator may involve
        some form of traffic redirection whereby traffic destined for the
        attack target is steered towards the mitigator. Common mechanisms to
        achieve this redirection depend on BGP <xref target="RFC4271" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4271"/> and DNS <xref target="RFC1035" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1035"/>. In turn, the mitigator inspects and scrubs the
        traffic and forwards the resulting (hopefully non-attack) traffic to
        the attack target. Thus, when a DOTS server receives an attack
        mitigation request from a DOTS client, it can be viewed as a way of
        causing traffic redirection for the attack target indicated.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-6">DOTS relies on mutual authentication and the pre-established
        service relationship between the DOTS client domain and the DOTS
        server domain to provide authorization. The DOTS server should enforce
        authorization mechanisms to restrict the mitigation scope a DOTS
        client can request, but such authorization mechanisms are
        deployment specific.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-7">Although co-location of DOTS server and mitigator within the same
        domain is expected to be a common deployment model, it is assumed that
        operators may require alternative models. Nothing in this document
        precludes such alternatives.</t>

          <t pn="section-2.2.2-1">A DOTS server is a DOTS agent capable of receiving, processing,
          and possibly acting on requests for help coordinating attack
          responses from DOTS clients.  The DOTS server authenticates and
          authorizes DOTS clients as described in <xref target="dots-sessions" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/> and maintains session state, tracks requests
          for mitigation, reports on the status of active mitigations, and
          terminates sessions in the extended absence of a client heartbeat
          or when a session times out.</t>
          <t pn="section-2.2.2-2">Assuming the preconditions discussed below exist, a DOTS client
          maintaining an active session with a DOTS server may reasonably
          expect some level of mitigation in response to a request for
          coordinated attack response.</t>
          <t pn="section-2.2.2-3">For a given DOTS client (administrative) domain, the DOTS server
          needs to be able to determine whether a given resource is in that
          domain. For example, this could take the form of associating a set
          of IP addresses and/or prefixes per DOTS client domain.  The DOTS
          server enforces authorization of signals for mitigation, filtering
          rules, and aliases for resources from DOTS clients. The mechanism of
          enforcement is not in scope for this document but is expected to
          restrict mitigation requests, filtering rules, aliases for addresses
          and prefixes, and/or services owned by the DOTS client domain, such
          that a DOTS client from one domain is not able to influence the
          network path to another domain. A DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          reject mitigation requests, filtering rules, and aliases for
          resources not owned by the requesting DOTS client's administrative
          domain. The exact mechanism for the DOTS servers to validate that
          the resources are within the scope of the DOTS client domain is
          deployment specific. For example, if the DOTS client domain uses
          Provider-Aggregatable prefixes for its resources and leverages the
          DDoS mitigation service of the Internet Transit Provider (ITP); the
          ITP knows the prefixes assigned to the DOTS client domain because
          they are assigned by the ITP itself. However, if the DDoS Mitigation
          is offered by a third-party DDoS mitigation service provider; it
          does not know the resources owned by the DOTS client domain. The
          DDoS mitigation service provider and the DOTS client domain can opt
          to use the identifier validation challenges discussed in <xref target="RFC8555" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8555"/> and <xref target="RFC8738" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8738"/> to identify whether or not the DOTS client domain
          actually controls the resources. The challenges for validating
          control of resources must be performed when no attack traffic is
          present and works only for "dns" and "ip" identifier types. Further,
          if the DOTS client lies about the resources owned by the DOTS client
          domain, the DDoS mitigation service provider can impose penalties
          for violating the SLA. A DOTS server <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also refuse
          a DOTS client's mitigation request for arbitrary reasons, within any
          limits imposed by business or SLAs between client and server
          domains.  If a DOTS server refuses a DOTS client's request for
          mitigation, the DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the refusal
          reason in the server signal sent to the client.</t>
          <t pn="section-2.2.2-4">A DOTS server is in regular contact with one or more
          mitigators. If a DOTS server accepts a DOTS client's request for
          help, the DOTS server forwards a translated form of that request to
          the mitigator(s) responsible for scrubbing attack traffic. Note that
          the form of the translated request passed from the DOTS server to
          the mitigator is not in scope; it may be as simple as an alert to
          mitigator operators, or highly automated using vendor or open
          application programming interfaces supported by the mitigator. The
          DOTS server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> report the actual scope of any
          mitigation enabled on behalf of a client.</t>

unintentionally inflict additional network disruption on the resources it
intends to protect. In one of the worst cases, a multihomed DOTS client could

          <t pn="section-3.1.2-1">With the required business agreements in place, the DOTS client
          initiates a DOTS session by contacting its DOTS server(s) over the

          service flexibility, neither the order of contact nor the time
          interval between channel creations is specified. A DOTS client

          only with symmetric or asymmetric keys to authenticate the
          provisioned DOTS clients. Only the keys would then be directly
          configured on DOTS clients, but the remaining configuration required

          acceptable signal loss, mitigation lifetime, and heartbeat intervals
          when establishing the DOTS signal channel session. A DOTS signal
          channel session is not active until DOTS agents have agreed on the

          and accept-listed prefixes or addresses, leverage vendor-specific
          extensions, and so on. Note that unlike the signal channel, there is
          no requirement that the data channel remains operational in attack

Out-of-scope business or SLAs may permit the mitigating

the mitigating domain is the upstream service provider for the attack target,
this may mean the mitigating domain and its other services and users continue to

            SIG-001 in <xref target="RFC8612" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8612"/>, the signal
            channel also requires mutual authentication between DOTS agents,
            with associated security state on both ends.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.2.4.1-3">Network instability is of particular concern with anycast
            signaling, as DOTS signal channels are expected to be long lived
            and potentially operating under congested network conditions
            caused by a volumetric DDoS attack.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.2.4.1-4">For example, a network configuration altering the route to the
            DOTS server during active anycast signaling may cause the DOTS
            client to send messages to a DOTS server other than the one with
            which it initially established a signaling session. That second
            DOTS server might not have the security state of the existing
            session, forcing the DOTS client to initialize a new DOTS session.
            This challenge might in part be mitigated by use of resumption via
            a pre-shared key (PSK) in TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446"/> and DTLS 1.3 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DTLS-PROTOCOL"/> (session resumption in TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5246"/> and DTLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC6347" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6347"/>), but keying material must
            then be available to all DOTS servers sharing the anycast Service
            Address, which has operational challenges of its own.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.2.4.1-5">While the DOTS client will try to establish a new DOTS session
            with the DOTS server now acting as the anycast DOTS Service
            Address, the link between DOTS client and server may be congested
            with attack traffic, making signal session establishment
            difficult. In such a scenario, anycast Service Address instability
            becomes a sort of signal session flapping, with obvious negative
            consequences for the DOTS deployment.</t>
            <t pn="section-3.2.4.1-6">Anycast signaling deployments similarly must also take into
            account active mitigations. Active mitigations initiated through a
            DOTS session may involve diverting traffic to a scrubbing
            center. If the DOTS session flaps due to anycast changes as
            described above, mitigation may also flap as the DOTS servers
            sharing the anycast DOTS service address toggles mitigation on
            detecting DOTS session loss, depending on whether or not the client has
            configured mitigation on loss of signal (<xref target="auto-mit-signal-loss" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.3.3"/>).</t>

          <t pn="section-3.2.5-2">Additional DOTS-specific considerations arise when NATs are part
          of the DOTS architecture. For example, DDoS attack detection behind
          a NAT will detect attacks against internal addresses. A DOTS client
          subsequently asked to request mitigation for the attacked scope of
          addresses cannot reasonably perform the task, due to the lack of

            addresses or prefixes to externally routable mitigation scopes by
            directly provisioning the mappings of external addresses to
            internal protected resources on the DOTS client. When the operator
            requests mitigation scoped for internal addresses, directly or

scope and duration, and manually instruct the DOTS client to send the mitigation
request to the DOTS server. In context, a manual request is a request directly
issued by the operator without automated decision making performed by a device
interacting with the DOTS client. Modes of manual mitigation requests include
an operator entering a command into a text interface, or directly interacting
with a graphical interface to send the request.</t>
          <t pn="section-3.3.1-2">An operator might do this, for example, in response to notice of an attack
delivered by attack detection equipment or software, and the alerting detector
lacks interfaces or is not configured to use available interfaces to translate
the alert to a mitigation request automatically.</t>
          <t pn="section-3.3.1-3">In a variation of the above scenario, the operator may have preconfigured on the
DOTS client mitigation requests for various resources in the operator's domain.
When notified of an attack, the DOTS client operator manually instructs the DOTS
client to send the relevant preconfigured mitigation request for the resources
under attack.</t>

DOTS gateway (back-to-back DOTS server and client). As in the previous scenario,
the scope and duration of the mitigation request are preexisting but, in this
case, are derived from the mitigation request received from a downstream DOTS
client by the DOTS server. Assuming the preconditions required by
<xref target="recursive-signaling" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2.3"/> are in place, the DOTS gateway operator may at any time
manually request mitigation from an upstream DOTS server, sending a mitigation
request derived from the downstream DOTS client's request.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.</t>
              <t>The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems.  This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.</t>
              <t>BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).  These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP.  BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths.</t>

              <t>This memo documents the various methods known to be in use by applications to establish direct communication in the presence of Network Address Translators (NATs) at the current time.  Although this memo is intended to be mainly descriptive, the Security Considerations section makes some purely advisory recommendations about how to deal with security vulnerabilities the applications could inadvertently create when using the methods described.  This memo covers NAT traversal approaches used by both TCP- and UDP-based applications.  This memo is not an endorsement of the methods described, but merely an attempt to capture them in a document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path between the originating and final terminating endpoints, which go beyond the definition of a SIP proxy, performing functions not defined in Standards Track RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in RFC 3261 is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined as the logical concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC).</t>
              <t>There are numerous types of SIP B2BUAs performing different roles in different ways; for example, IP Private Branch Exchanges (IPBXs), Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and Application Servers (ASs). This document identifies several common B2BUA roles in order to provide taxonomy other documents can use and reference.</t>

              <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
              <t>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
              <t>Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>
              <t>This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special behavior from them.</t>
              <t>STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.</t>
