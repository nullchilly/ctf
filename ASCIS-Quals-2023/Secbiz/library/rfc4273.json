This memo fixes errors\r\nintroduced when the MIB module was converted to use the SMIv2\r\nlanguage.  This memo also updates references to the current SNMP\r\nframework documents.\r\n\r\nThis memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this\r\nMIB module in a historical context, to provide clarifications of some\r\nitems, and to note errors where the MIB module fails to fully\r\nrepresent the BGP protocol.  Work is currently in progress to replace\r\nthis MIB module with a new one representing the current state of the\r\nBGP protocol and its extensions.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 1269 and RFC 1657.
