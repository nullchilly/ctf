EVPN is a scalable\r\nsolution for NVO3 networks and keeps the independence of the underlay\r\nIP Fabric, i.e., there is no need to enable Protocol Independent\r\nMulticast (PIM) in the underlay network and maintain multicast states\r\nfor tenant Broadcast Domains. This document describes the use of EVPN\r\nfor NVO3 networks and discusses its applicability to basic Layer 2\r\nand Layer 3 connectivity requirements and to advanced features such\r\nas MAC Mobility, MAC Protection and Loop Protection, multihoming,\r\nData Center Interconnect (DCI), and much more. No new EVPN procedures\r\nare introduced.","pub_date":"September 2023","keywords":["EVPN","Applicability","NVO3"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9469","errata_url":null}
