In its present form, LMP focuses on peer\r\nnodes, i.e., nodes that peer in signaling and\/or routing.  This\r\ndocument proposes extensions to LMP to allow it to be used between\r\na peer node and an adjacent optical line system (OLS).  These\r\nextensions are intended to satisfy the \"Optical Link Interface\r\nRequirements\" described in a companion document.
