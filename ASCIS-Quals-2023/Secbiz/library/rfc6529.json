It describes a\r\nprotocol used to manage communication between processes residing on\r\nindependent Hosts.  It addresses issues of multiplexing multiple\r\nstreams of communication (including addressing, flow control, connection\r\nestablishment\/disestablishment, and other signaling) over a single hardware\r\ninterface.  It was the official protocol of the ARPA Network from January 1972\r\nuntil the switch to TCP\/IP in January 1983.  It is offered as an RFC at this\r\nlate date to help complete the historical record available through the RFC\r\nseries.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for the historical record.","pub_date":"April 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6529","errata_url":null}
