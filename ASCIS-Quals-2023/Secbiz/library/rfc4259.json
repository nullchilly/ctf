The MPEG-2 TS has\r\nbeen widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services but\r\nalso as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks.  Examples of\r\nsystems using MPEG-2 include the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) and\r\nAdvanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards for Digital\r\nTelevision.\r\n\r\nThe document identifies the need for a set of Internet standards\r\ndefining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an\r\nIP subnetwork.  It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP\r\ndatagrams and proposes protocols to perform IPv6\/IPv4 address\r\nresolution, to associate IP packets with the properties of the\r\nLogical Channels provided by an MPEG-2 TS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2005","keywords":["digital television","dvb","digital video broadcast","atsc","advanced television systems committee"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4259","errata_url":null}
