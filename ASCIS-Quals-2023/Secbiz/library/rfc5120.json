This document\r\ndescribes how to run, within a single IS-IS domain, a set of\r\nindependent IP topologies that we call Multi-Topologies (MTs).\r\nThis MT extension can be used for a variety of purposes, such as an\r\nin-band management network \"on top\" of the original IGP topology,\r\nmaintaining separate IGP routing domains for isolated multicast or\r\nIPv6 islands within the backbone, or forcing a subset of an address\r\nspace to follow a different topology.
