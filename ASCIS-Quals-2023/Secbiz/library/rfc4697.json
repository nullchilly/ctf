We offer implementation advice to iterative resolver\r\ndevelopers to alleviate these unnecessary queries.  The\r\nrecommendations made in this document are a direct byproduct of\r\nobservation and analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen at\r\ntwo of the thirteen root name servers and all thirteen com\/net TLD\r\nname servers.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"October 2006","keywords":["[--------|b]","domain name system","tld","top level domain"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0123"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4697","errata_url":null}
