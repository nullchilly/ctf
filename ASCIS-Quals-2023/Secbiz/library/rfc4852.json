These networks are characterized as having\r\nmultiple internal links and one or more router connections to\r\none or more Providers, and as being managed by a network operations entity.\r\nThe analysis focuses on a base set of transition notational networks\r\nand requirements expanded from a previous document on enterprise\r\nscenarios.  Discussion is provided on a focused set of transition\r\nanalysis required for the enterprise to transition to IPv6, assuming a\r\nDual-IP layer (IPv4 and IPv6) network and node environment within the\r\nenterprise.  Then, a set of transition mechanisms are recommended for\r\neach notational network.
