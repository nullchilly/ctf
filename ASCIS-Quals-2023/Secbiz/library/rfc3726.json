Signaling is mainly considered for Quality of Service (Qos) such as the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).  However, in recent years, several other applications of signaling have been defined.  For example, signaling for label distribution in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) or signaling to middleboxes.  To achieve wide applicability of the requirements, the starting point is a diverse set of scenarios\/use cases concerning various types of networks and application interactions.  This document presents the assumptions before listing the requirements.  The requirements are grouped according to areas such as architecture and design goals, signaling flows, layering, performance, flexibility, security, and mobility.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
