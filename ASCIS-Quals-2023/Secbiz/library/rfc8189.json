In addition, it extends the\r\nconstraints to further filter those maps by allowing an ALTO Client\r\nto specify a logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["ALTO Information Resources","Network Map","PID","Filtered Network Map","Endpoint Property Service","Endpoint Cost Service","Multi-Cost","Filtered Multi-Cost Map","Multi-Cost Data Format","Testable Cost Types","or-constraints"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8189","errata_url":null}
