For this purpose,\r\nGMPLS defined a wavelength label as only having significance\r\nbetween two neighbors.  Global wavelength semantics are not\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate interoperability in a network composed of\r\nnext generation lambda-switch-capable equipment, this document\r\ndefines a standard lambda label format that is compliant with\r\nthe Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and Coarse Wavelength\r\nDivision Multiplexing (CWDM) grids defined by the International\r\nTelecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector.\r\nThe label format defined in this document can be used in GMPLS\r\nsignaling and routing protocols.
