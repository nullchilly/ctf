This document introduces a mechanism\r\nthat resource servers can use to signal to a client that the\r\nauthentication event associated with the access token of the current\r\nrequest does not meet its authentication requirements and, further,\r\nhow to meet them. This document also codifies a mechanism for a\r\nclient to request that an authorization server achieve a specific\r\nauthentication strength or recentness when processing an\r\nauthorization request.","pub_date":"September 2023","keywords":["security","oauth2","openid connect","oauth","step-up"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9470","errata_url":null}
