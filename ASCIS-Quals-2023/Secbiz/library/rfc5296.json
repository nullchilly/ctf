In systems\r\nwhere EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to not repeat\r\nthe entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  This document\r\nspecifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support\r\nan EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication\r\nbetween the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any\r\nauthenticator.  The re-authentication server may be in the home\r\nnetwork or in the local network to which the peer is connecting.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"August 2008","keywords":["[--------]","extensible authentication protocol","authentication modes"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6696"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5296","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5296"}
