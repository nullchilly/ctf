The primary objective of this LE\r\nPHB is to protect Best-Effort (BE) traffic (packets forwarded with\r\nthe default PHB) from LE traffic in congestion situations, i.e., when\r\nresources become scarce, BE traffic has precedence over LE traffic\r\nand may preempt it.  Alternatively, packets forwarded by the LE PHB\r\ncan be associated with a scavenger service class, i.e., they scavenge\r\notherwise-unused resources only.  There are numerous uses for this\r\nPHB, e.g., for background traffic of low precedence, such as bulk\r\ndata transfers with low priority in time, non-time-critical backups,\r\nlarger software updates, web search engines while gathering\r\ninformation from web servers and so on.  This document recommends a\r\nstandard Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value for the LE\r\nPHB.\r\n\r\nThis specification obsoletes RFC 3662 and updates the DSCP\r\nrecommended in RFCs 4594 and 8325 to use the DSCP assigned in this\r\nspecification.","pub_date":"June 2019","keywords":["Lower Effort","Per-Hop Behavior","Scavenger Service"],"obsoletes":["RFC3662"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4594","RFC8325"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8622","errata_url":null}
