These codes have many interesting properties:\r\nthey are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many\r\nuse-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding\r\nthroughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to\r\nprotect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally\r\nseveral mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are\r\nalso a good solution whenever the processing load of a software\r\nencoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.","pub_date":"December 2012","keywords":["Forward Error Correction","LDPC-Staircase"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6816","errata_url":null}
