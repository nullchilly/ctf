This document\r\ndiscusses the uses of service identification, and outlines several\r\narchitectural principles behind the process.  It identifies perils\r\nwhen service identification is not done properly -- including fraud,\r\ninteroperability failures, and stifling of innovation.  It then\r\noutlines a set of recommended practices for service identification.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2010","keywords":["service identification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5897","errata_url":null}
