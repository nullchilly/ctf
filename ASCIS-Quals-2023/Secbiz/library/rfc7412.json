This document provides requirements for\r\nany mechanism that would be used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data\r\npaths, in networks that delegate protection switch coordination to\r\nthe data plane.","pub_date":"December 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7412","errata_url":null}
