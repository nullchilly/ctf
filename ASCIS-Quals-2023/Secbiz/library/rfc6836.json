The MR can then query that ETR to obtain the\r\nactual mapping information, which consists of a list of Routing\r\nLocators (RLOCs) for the EID.  Termed the Alternative Logical\r\nTopology (ALT), the index is built as an overlay network on the\r\npublic Internet using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Generic\r\nRouting Encapsulation (GRE).  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6836","errata_url":null}
