The function\r\nis designed to facilitate optimal routing in cases where all nodes\r\nare connected to a single home agent; thus, the use case is route\r\noptimization within a single organization or similar entity.  The\r\nfunctionality enables the discovery of eligible peer nodes (based on\r\ninformation received from the home agent) and their network prefixes,\r\nand the establishment of a direct tunnel between such nodes.\r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["mobile router","mobile network prefix","correspondent router"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6521","errata_url":null}
