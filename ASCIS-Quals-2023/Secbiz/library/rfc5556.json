These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even\r\ntemporary ones, during route propagation, because of the lack of\r\nheader loop detection support.  Routing tends not to take full\r\nadvantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping pairwise paths\r\n(in the case of spanning trees).  This document addresses these\r\nconcerns and suggests applying modern\r\nnetwork-layer routing protocols at the link layer.  This document\r\nassumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability beyond\r\nthat of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would\r\nbe backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their\r\nexisting plug-and-play capabilities.  This memo provides information \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2009","keywords":["spanning tree protocol","ieee 802.1"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5556","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5556"}
