When implemented using the Session Initiation\r\nProtocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address\r\nof Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This\r\nfeature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP Private\r\nBranch Exchange (IPBX) offerings and is likely to be implemented on\r\nSIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business\r\nenvironment.  This feature allows several user agents (UAs) to share\r\na common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in\r\nthe group, and pick up or join calls within the group.  This document\r\ndiscusses use cases, lists requirements, and defines extensions to\r\nimplement this feature.  This specification updates RFCs 3261 and\r\n4235.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3261","RFC4235"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7463","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7463"}
