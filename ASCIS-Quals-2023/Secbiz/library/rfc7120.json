This\r\nprocess can be used to alleviate the problem where code point\r\nallocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation\r\nand deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC, which would\r\nnormally trigger code point allocation.  The procedures in this\r\ndocument are intended to apply only to IETF Stream documents.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":["early allocation","policy","protocol"],"obsoletes":["RFC4020"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0100"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7120","errata_url":null}
