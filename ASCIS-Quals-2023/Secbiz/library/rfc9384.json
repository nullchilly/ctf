BFD is leveraged by routing protocols,\r\nincluding the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), to bring down routing\r\nprotocol connections more quickly than the original protocol timers. \r\n\r\nThis document defines a subcode for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION\r\nmessage (Section 6.7 of RFC 4271) for use when a BGP connection is\r\nbeing closed due to a BFD session going down.","pub_date":"March 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9384","errata_url":null}
