Link-Local\nSignaling (LLS) is used to advertise the requirement for strict-mode\nBFD session establishment for an OSPF adjacency. If both OSPF\nneighbors advertise BFD strict-mode, adjacency formation will be\nblocked until a BFD session has been successfully established.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 2328 by augmenting the OSPF neighbor state\nmachine with a check for BFD session up before progression from Init\nto 2-Way state when operating in OSPF BFD strict-mode.","pub_date":"February 2023","keywords":["IGP","OSPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2328"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9355","errata_url":null}
