This heterogeneity\r\nimplies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide\r\nservices such as confidentiality, integrity, and source\r\nauthentication of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets\r\nsuitable for the various environments.  The range of solutions makes\r\nit difficult for RTP-based application developers to pick the most\r\nsuitable mechanism.  This document provides an overview of a number\r\nof security solutions for RTP and gives guidance for developers on\r\nhow to choose the appropriate security mechanism.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["Secure RTP","SRTP","key management","real-time","media"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7201","errata_url":null}
