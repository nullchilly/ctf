Data becomes independent\r\nfrom location, application, storage, and means of transportation,\r\nenabling or enhancing a number of desirable features, such as\r\nsecurity, user mobility, multicast, and in-network caching.\r\nMechanisms for realizing these benefits is the subject of ongoing\r\nresearch in the IRTF and elsewhere.  This document describes current\r\nresearch challenges in ICN, including naming, security, routing,\r\nsystem scalability, mobility management, wireless networking,\r\ntransport services, in-network caching, and network management.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\r\nResearch Group (ICNRG).","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["Information centric networking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7927","errata_url":null}
