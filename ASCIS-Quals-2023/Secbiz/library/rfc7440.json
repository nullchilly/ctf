One of its primary uses is in the early stages of\r\nnodes booting from a Local Area Network (LAN).  TFTP has been used for this\r\napplication because it is very simple to implement.  The employment of\r\na lockstep scheme limits throughput when used on a LAN.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a TFTP option that allows the client and\r\nserver to negotiate a window size of consecutive blocks to send as an\r\nalternative for replacing the single-block lockstep schema.  The TFTP\r\noption mechanism employed is described in \"TFTP Option Extension\"\r\n(RFC 2347).","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7440","errata_url":null}
