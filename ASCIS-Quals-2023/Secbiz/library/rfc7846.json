The specification outlines the architecture of\r\nthe protocol and its functionality; it also describes message flows,\r\nmessage processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax, and\r\nsemantics.  The PPSTP enables cooperating peers to\r\nform content-streaming overlay networks to support near real-time\r\ndelivery of structured media content (audio, video, and associated timed\r\ntext and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable),\r\nand multi-view (3D) videos in live, time-shifted, and on-demand\r\nmodes.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":["structured media","peer swarms control","live streaming","video on demand"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7846","errata_url":null}
