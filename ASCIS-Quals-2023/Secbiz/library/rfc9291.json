The\r\nL2NM complements the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) by providing a\r\nnetwork-centric view of the service that is internal to a service\r\nprovider. The L2NM is particularly meant to be used by a network\r\ncontroller to derive the configuration information that will be sent\r\nto relevant network devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, this document defines a YANG module to manage Ethernet segments\r\nand the initial versions of two IANA-maintained modules that include\r\na set of identities of BGP Layer 2 encapsulation types and pseudowire\r\ntypes.","pub_date":"September 2022","keywords":["automation","network model","service provider","service provisionning","network automation","service delivery"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9291","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9291"}
