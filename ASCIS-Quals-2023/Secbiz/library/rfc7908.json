Frequent incidents that result in significant\r\ndisruptions to Internet routing are labeled route leaks, but to date\r\na common definition of the term has been lacking.  This document\r\nprovides a working definition of route leaks while keeping in mind\r\nthe real occurrences that have received significant attention.\r\nFurther, this document attempts to enumerate (though not\r\nexhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events\r\non the Internet.  The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers\r\nseveral forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of\r\nconcern to the Internet user community as well as the network\r\noperator community.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["BGP","BGPSEC","Route Leak","Route Leak Detection","Route Leak Mitigation","BGP Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7908","errata_url":null}
