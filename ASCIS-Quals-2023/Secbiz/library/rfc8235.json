The Schnorr NIZK proof allows one to prove\r\nthe knowledge of a discrete logarithm without leaking any information\r\nabout its value.  It can serve as a useful building block for many\r\ncryptographic protocols to ensure that participants follow the\r\nprotocol specification honestly.  This document specifies the Schnorr\r\nNIZK proof in both the finite field and the elliptic curve settings.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["Zero-Knowledge Proof","Schnorr NIZK proof","Identification protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8235","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8235"}
