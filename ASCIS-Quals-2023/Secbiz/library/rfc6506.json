This behavior is different from\r\nauthentication mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2,\r\nIntermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), RIP, and Routing\r\nInformation Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)).  In some environments,\r\nit has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain\r\nand thus cannot be used.  This document defines an alternative\r\nmechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does\r\nnot only depend upon IPsec for authentication.
