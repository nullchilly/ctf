This document proposes extensions to OSPFv2 and\r\nOSPFv3 for advertising optional router capabilities.  A new Router\r\nInformation (RI) Link State Advertisement (LSA) is proposed for this\r\npurpose.  In OSPFv2, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new opaque\r\nLSA type ID.  In OSPFv3, the RI LSA will be implemented with a new\r\nLSA type function code.  In both protocols, the RI LSA can be\r\nadvertised at any of the defined flooding scopes (link, area, or\r\nautonomous system (AS)).
