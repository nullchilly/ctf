These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys,\r\nshared in advance among the communicating parties.  The first set of\r\nciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations for authentication.\r\nThe second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a\r\npre-shared key, and the third set combines public key authentication\r\nof the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.
