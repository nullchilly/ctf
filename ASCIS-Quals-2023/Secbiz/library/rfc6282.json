This document specifies an IPv6 header\r\ncompression format for IPv6 packet delivery in Low Power Wireless\r\nPersonal Area Networks (6LoWPANs).  The compression format relies on\r\nshared context to allow compression of arbitrary prefixes.  How the\r\ninformation is maintained in that shared context is out of scope.\r\nThis document specifies compression of multicast addresses and a\r\nframework for compressing next headers.  UDP header compression is\r\nspecified within this framework.
