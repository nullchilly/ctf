Bidirectional trees are built\r\nusing a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism\r\noperating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the\r\nassistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from\r\nsources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree\r\nto receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF\r\nelection takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route\r\nto the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven\r\nprotocol events.
