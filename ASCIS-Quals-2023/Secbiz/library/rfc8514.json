It defines a new IMAP message\r\nattribute called \"save date\" that, unlike the existing \"internal                     \r\ndate\" attribute, always indicates the moment at which the message was\r\nsaved in its current mailbox.  The SAVEDATE capability extends the\r\nFETCH command with the means to retrieve the save date attribute and\r\nextends the SEARCH command to allow using the save date attribute in\r\nsearching criteria.","pub_date":"January 2019","keywords":["imap","savedate"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8514","errata_url":null}
