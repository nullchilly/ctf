The ForCES protocol is\r\nextended with a table range operation and a new extension for error\r\nhandling.  This document updates the semantics in RFCs 5810 and 7121\r\nto achieve that end goal.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["ForCES","Protocol","Extension"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5810","RFC7121"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7391","errata_url":null}
