This and other\r\nsimilar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast\r\nsignaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless\r\nnetwork may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets\r\nand IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-\r\ntransitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6\r\nlink concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and\r\nsometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This\r\ndocument describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery,\r\nits addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low-\r\npower Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The\r\ndocument thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the\r\noptimizations defined here.
