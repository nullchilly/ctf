As a result, it does not use a three-way\r\nhandshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point media.\r\nThis paper defines a backward-compatible extension to the protocol\r\nthat provides for a three-way handshake.  It is fully interoperable\r\nwith systems that do not support the extension.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than\r\n256 point-to-point links on a single router.\r\n\r\nThis extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; this\r\npaper is provided to the Internet community in order to allow\r\ninteroperable implementations to be built by other vendors.
