        This document describes an architecture that provides some assurance that service instances are running as expected.
        As services rely upon multiple subservices provided by a variety of elements, including the underlying network devices and functions,
          getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with a holistic view of all involved elements.
          This architecture not only helps to correlate the service degradation with symptoms of a specific network component but, it also lists the services impacted by the failure or degradation of a specific network component.

        Network Service YANG Modules  <xref target="RFC8199" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8199"/> describe the configuration, state data, operations, and notifications of abstract representations of services implemented on one or multiple network elements.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">
        Service orchestrators use Network Service YANG Modules that will infer network-wide configuration and, therefore, the invocation of the appropriate device modules (<xref target="RFC8969" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="3" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8969#section-3" derivedContent="RFC8969"/>).
           Knowing that a configuration is applied doesn't imply that the provisioned service instance is up and running as expected.
           For instance, the service might be degraded because of a failure in the network, the service quality may be degraded, or a service function may be reachable at the IP level but does not provide its intended function.
           Thus, the network operator must monitor the service's operational data at the same time as the configuration (<xref target="RFC8969" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="3.3" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8969#section-3.3" derivedContent="RFC8969"/>).
           To fuel that task, the industry has been standardizing on telemetry to push network element performance information (e.g., <xref target="RFC9375" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9375"/>).
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
        A network administrator needs to monitor its network and services as a whole, independently of the management protocols.
           With different protocols come different data models and different ways to model the same type of information.
           When network administrators deal with multiple management protocols, the network management entities have to perform the difficult and time-consuming job of mapping data models,
           e.g., the model used for configuration with the model used for monitoring when separate models or protocols are used.
           This problem is compounded by a large, disparate set of data sources (e.g., MIB modules, YANG data models <xref target="RFC7950" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7950"/>, IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) information elements <xref target="RFC7011" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7011"/>, syslog plain text <xref target="RFC5424" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5424"/>, Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) <xref target="RFC8907" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8907"/>, RADIUS <xref target="RFC2865" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2865"/>, etc.).
           In order to avoid this data model mapping, the industry converged on model-driven telemetry to stream the service operational data, reusing the YANG data models used for configuration.
           Model-driven telemetry greatly facilitates the notion of closed-loop automation, whereby events and updated operational states streamed from the network drive remediation change back into the network.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">
        However, it proves difficult for network operators to correlate the service degradation with the network root cause,
        for example, "Why does my layer 3 virtual private network (L3VPN) fail to connect?" or "Why is this specific service not highly responsive?"
           The reverse, i.e., which services are impacted when a network component fails or degrades, is also important for operators,
           for example, "Which services are impacted when this specific optic decibel milliwatt (dBm) begins to degrade?",
             "Which applications are impacted by an imbalance in this Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) bundle?", or "Is that issue actually impacting any other customers?"
           This task usually falls under the so-called "Service Impact Analysis" functional block.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">
           This document defines an architecture implementing Service Assurance for Intent-based Networking (SAIN).
           Intent-based approaches are often declarative, starting from a statement of "The service works as expected" and trying to enforce it.
           However, some already-defined services might have been designed using a different approach.
           Aligned with <xref target="RFC7149" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="3.3" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7149#section-3.3" derivedContent="RFC7149"/>, and instead of requiring a declarative intent as a starting point,
           this architecture focuses on already-defined services and tries to infer the meaning of "The service works as expected".
           To do so, the architecture works from an assurance graph, deduced from the configuration pushed to the device for enabling the service instance.
           If the SAIN orchestrator supports it, the service model (<xref target="RFC8309" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="2" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8309#section-2" derivedContent="RFC8309"/>) or the network model (<xref target="RFC8969" format="default" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8969#section-2.1" derivedContent="RFC8969"/>) can also be used to build the assurance graph.
           In that case and if the service model includes the declarative intent as well, the SAIN orchestrator can rely on the declared intent instead of inferring it.
           The assurance graph may also be explicitly completed to add an intent not exposed in the service model itself.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">
           The assurance graph of a service instance is decomposed into components, which are then assured independently.
           The top of the assurance graph represents the service instance to assure, and its children represent components identified as its direct dependencies; each component can have dependencies as well.
            Components involved in the assurance graph of a service are called subservices.
           The SAIN orchestrator updates the assurance graph  automatically when the service instance is modified.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">
          When a service is degraded, the SAIN architecture will highlight where in the assurance service graph to look, as opposed to going hop by hop to troubleshoot the issue.
          More precisely, the SAIN architecture will associate to each service instance a list of symptoms originating from specific subservices, corresponding to components of the network.
          These components are good candidates for explaining the source of a service degradation.
          Not only can this architecture help to correlate service degradation with network root cause/symptoms, but it can deduce from the assurance graph the list of service instances impacted by a component degradation/failure.
          This added value informs the operational team where to focus its attention for maximum return.
          Indeed, the operational team is likely to focus their priority on the degrading/failing components impacting the highest number of their customers, especially the ones with the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) contracts involving penalties in case of failure.
      </t>

        This architecture provides the building blocks to assure both physical and virtual entities and is flexible with respect to services and subservices of (distributed) graphs and components (<xref target="flexible_architecture" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.7"/>).

        The goal of SAIN is to assure that service instances are operating as expected (i.e., the observed service is matching the expected service) and, if not, to pinpoint what is wrong.
          More precisely, SAIN computes a score for each service instance and outputs symptoms explaining that score.
          The only valid situation where no symptoms are returned is when the score is maximal, indicating that no issues were detected for that service instance.
          The score augmented with the symptoms is called the health status. The exact meaning of the health score value is out of scope of this document. However, the following constraints should be followed: the higher the score, the better the service health is and the two extrema are 0 meaning the service is completely broken, and 100 meaning the service is completely operational.

        The SAIN architecture is a generic architecture, which generates an assurance graph from service instance(s), as specified in <xref target="inferring" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>.
          This architecture is applicable to not only multiple environments (e.g., wireline and wireless)
          but also different domains (e.g., 5G network function virtualization (NFV) domain with a virtual infrastructure manager (VIM), etc.)
          and, as already noted, for physical or virtual devices, as well as virtual functions.
          Thanks to the distributed graph design principle, graphs from different environments and orchestrators can be combined to obtain the graph of a service instance that spans over multiple domains.

        As an example of a service, let us consider a point-to-point layer 2 virtual private network (L2VPN).
        <xref target="RFC8466" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8466"/> specifies the parameters for such a service.
          Examples of symptoms might be symptoms reported by specific subservices, including "Interface has high error rate", "Interface flapping", or "Device almost out of memory", as well as symptoms more specific to the service (such as "Site disconnected from VPN").

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">
          To compute the health status of an instance of such a service, the service definition is decomposed into an assurance graph formed by subservices linked through dependencies. Each subservice is then turned into an expression graph that details how to fetch metrics from the devices and compute the health status of the subservice. The subservice expressions are combined according to the dependencies between the subservices in order to obtain the expression graph that computes the health status of the service instance.

          Based on the service configuration provided by the service orchestrator, the SAIN orchestrator decomposes the assurance graph.
          It then sends to the SAIN agents the assurance graph along with some other configuration options.
          The SAIN agents are responsible for building the expression graph and computing the health statuses in a distributed manner.
          The collector is in charge of collecting and displaying the current inferred health status of the service instances and subservices.
   The
   collector also detects changes in the assurance graph structures (e.g., an
   occurrence of a switchover from primary to backup path) and
   forwards the information to the orchestrator, which reconfigures the agents.
          Finally, the automation loop is closed by having the SAIN collector provide feedback to the network/service orchestrator.

            system. Here, combining means that two subservices having the
            same type and the same parameters are in fact the same
            subservice and thus a single node in the graph. For instance,
            the subservice of type "device" with the only parameter
            (the device ID) set to "PE1" will appear only once in the
            whole assurance graph, even if several service instances rely
            on that device. Now, if two engineers design assurance graphs for
            two different services, and Engineer A decides that an interface
            depends on the link it is connected to, but Engineer B decides that
            the link depends on the interface it is connected to, then when
            combining the two assurance graphs, we will have a circular
            dependency interface -&gt; link -&gt; interface.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-3">
              Another case possibly resulting in circular dependencies is when subservices are not properly identified.
              Assume that we want to assure a cloud-based computing cluster that runs containers.
              We could represent the cluster by a subservice and the network service connecting containers on the cluster by another subservice.
              We would likely model that as the network service depending on the cluster, because the network service runs in a container supported by the cluster.
              Conversely, the cluster depends on the network service for connectivity between containers, which creates a circular dependency.
              A finer decomposition might distinguish between the resources for executing containers (a part of our cluster subservice) and the communication between the containers (which could be modeled in the same way as communication between routers).
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-4">
            In any case, it is likely that circular dependencies will show up in
            the assurance graph. A first step would be to detect
            circular dependencies as soon as possible in the SAIN
            architecture. Such a detection could be carried out by
            the SAIN orchestrator. Whenever a circular dependency
            is detected, the newly added service would not be
            monitored until more careful modeling or alignment
            between the different teams (Engineers A and B) remove the circular
            dependency.

          From the assurance graph, a so-called global computation graph is derived.
            First, each subservice instance is transformed into a set of subservice expressions that take metrics and constants as input (i.e., sources of the DAG) and produce the status of the subservice based on some heuristics.
            For instance, the health of an interface is 0 (minimal score) with the symptom "interface admin-down" if the interface is disabled in the configuration.
            Then, for each service instance, the service expressions are constructed by combining the subservice expressions of its dependencies.
            The way service expressions are combined depends on the dependency types (impacting or informational).
            Finally, the global computation graph is built by combining the service expressions to get a global view of all subservices.

          The set of dependency types presented here is not exhaustive.
          More specific dependency types can be defined by extending the YANG module.
          For instance, a connectivity subservice depending on several path subservices is partially impacted if only one of these paths fails.
          Adding these new dependency types requires defining the corresponding operation for combining statuses of subservices.

          Subservices shall not be dependent on the protocol used to retrieve the metrics.
            To justify this, let's consider the interface operational status.
            Depending on the device capabilities, this status can be collected by an industry-accepted YANG module (e.g., IETF or Openconfig <xref target="OpenConfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OpenConfig"/>), by a vendor-specific YANG module, or even by a MIB module.
            If the subservice was dependent on the mechanism to collect the operational status, then we would need multiple subservice definitions in order to support all different mechanisms.
            This also implies that, while waiting for all the metrics to be available via standard YANG modules, SAIN agents might have to retrieve metric values via nonstandard YANG data models, MIB modules, the Command-Line Interface (CLI), etc., effectively implementing a normalization layer between data models and information models.

             In order to keep subservices independent of metric collection method 
   (or, expressed differently, to support multiple combinations of
   platforms, OSes, and even vendors), the architecture introduces the
   concept of "metric engine".
          The metric engine maps each device-independent metric used in the subservices to a list of device-specific metric implementations that precisely define how to fetch values for that metric.
          The mapping is parameterized by the characteristics (i.e., model, OS version, etc.) of the device from which the metrics are fetched.
          This metric engine is included in the SAIN agent.

              As such, symptoms related to the device health should be ignored.

              When a service or subservice is flagged as under maintenance, it must report a generic "Under Maintenance" symptom for propagation towards subservices that depend on this specific subservice.

          The SAIN architecture is flexible in terms of components. While the 
          SAIN architecture in <xref target="figure_1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> makes a distinction between two components,
            the service orchestrator and the SAIN orchestrator, in practice the two components are most likely combined.
          Similarly, the SAIN agents are displayed in <xref target="figure_1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> as being separate components. In practice, the SAIN agents could be either independent 
          components or directly integrated in monitored entities.
          A practical example is an agent in a router.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.7-2">
            The SAIN architecture is also flexible in terms of services and subservices.
            In the defined architecture, the SAIN orchestrator is coupled to a service orchestrator, which defines the kinds of services that the architecture handles.
            Most examples in this document deal with the notion of Network Service YANG Modules with well-known services, such as L2VPN or tunnels.
            However, the concept of services is general enough to cross into different domains.
            One of them is the domain of service management on network elements, which also require their own assurance.
            Examples include a DHCP server on a Linux server, a data plane, an IPFIX export, etc.
            The notion of "service" is generic in this architecture and depends on the service orchestrator and underlying network system, as illustrated by the following examples:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.7-3">
          <li pn="section-3.7-3.1">If a main service orchestrator coordinates several lower-level controllers, a service for the controller can be a subservice from the point of view of the orchestrator.</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.7-5">
          The SAIN architecture is also flexible in terms of distributed graphs. 
          As shown in  <xref target="figure_1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>, the architecture comprises several agents.
          Each agent is responsible for handling a subgraph of the assurance graph.  
          The collector is responsible for fetching the subgraphs from the different
          agents and gluing them together.  As an example, in the graph from  <xref target="figure_2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>, the subservices relative to Peer 1 might be handled by a 
          different agent than the subservices relative to Peer 2, and the Connectivity 
          and IS-IS subservices might be handled by yet another agent.  The agents will 
          export their partial graph, and the collector will stitch them together as 
          dependencies of the service instance.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.7-6">
          And finally, the SAIN architecture is flexible in terms of what it monitors. 
          Most, if not all, examples in this document refer to physical components, but
          this is not a constraint. Indeed, the assurance of virtual components would
          follow the same principles, and an assurance graph composed of virtualized 
          components (or a mix of virtualized and physical ones) is supported by
          this architecture.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.8-2">
          The SAIN agent might have to remove some symptoms for specific subservice symptoms because

The date and time of a particular subservice instance (again dependencies or under maintenance) might be kept.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions to be provided in a structured way.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document has been written with the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues. This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on. This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

NTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet Protocol version 6 address family. NTPv4 includes fundamental improvements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend the potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern workstations and fast LANs. It includes a dynamic server discovery scheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not required. It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and implementation and includes an optional extension mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used under an SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.
