RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be\r\ncarried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between\r\nthe fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called\r\nACH TLVs\r\n\r\nNo Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore,\r\nit is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant\r\nproblems to the fast path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to\r\nbe processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the\r\nassociated registry.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["ACH","G-ACh","Pseudowire","PW","MPLS-TP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5586"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7026","errata_url":null}
