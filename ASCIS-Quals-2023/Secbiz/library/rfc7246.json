Typically, the MDT begins and\r\nends in non-MPLS regions, but travels through an MPLS region.  In\r\nsuch cases, it can be useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP\r\nMDT, then convert it to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path \r\n(MP-LSP) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and then convert it \r\nback to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.  \r\nOther documents specify the procedures for building such a hybrid \r\nMDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) in the non-MPLS \r\nregion of the network, and using Multipoint Label Distribution\r\nProtocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region.  This document extends those\r\nprocedures to handle the case where the link connecting the two\r\nregions is a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) table link, as\r\ndefined in the \"BGP IP\/MPLS VPN\" specification.  However, this\r\ndocument is primarily aimed at particular use cases where VRFs are\r\nused to support multicast applications other than multicast VPN.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7438"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7246","errata_url":null}
