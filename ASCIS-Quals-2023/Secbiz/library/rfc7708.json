This document specifies an\r\nadditional VCCV control channel type to be used with pseudowires that\r\ndo not use the PW Control Word and that are carried over an MPLS\r\nnetwork.  This new VCCV CC type uses the Generic Associated Channel\r\nLabel defined in RFC 5586 to distinguish VCCV packets from packets\r\ncarrying user data.  This new VCCV CC type introduces compatibility\r\nwith the method of MPLS Label Switched Path Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM) identification, particularly in\r\nMPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks (RFC 5921).","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["VCCV","GAL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7708","errata_url":null}
