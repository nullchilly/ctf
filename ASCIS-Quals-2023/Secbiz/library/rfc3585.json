The information model described in this document models the configuration parameters defined by IPSec.  The information model also covers the parameters found by the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE).  Other key exchange protocols could easily be added to the information model by a simple extension.  Further extensions can further be added easily due to the object-oriented nature of the model. This information model is based upon the core policy classes as defined in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions (PCIMe).
