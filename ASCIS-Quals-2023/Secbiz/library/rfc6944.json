There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms,\r\nbut there is no record of the recommended implementation status of\r\neach algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on\r\nalgorithm implementation status for DNSSEC component software.  This\r\ndocument lists each algorithm's status based on the current\r\nreference.  In the case that an algorithm is specified without an\r\nimplementation status, this document assigns one.  This document\r\nupdates RFCs 2536, 2539, 3110, 4034, 4398, 5155, 5702, and 5933.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8624"],"updates":["RFC2536","RFC2539","RFC3110","RFC4034","RFC4398","RFC5155","RFC5702","RFC5933"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6944","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6944"}
