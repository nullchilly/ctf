The event was largely\r\nunnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means\r\nthat no major problems were detected.  For the Internet, however,\r\nthere was a major change on a short timescale.  This memo discusses\r\nmeasurements that the authors made from the perspective of an end\r\nuser with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.  Our measurements include\r\nthe number of most popular networks providing AAAA records for their\r\nservice, as well as delay and connection failure statistics.","pub_date":"July 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6948","errata_url":null}
