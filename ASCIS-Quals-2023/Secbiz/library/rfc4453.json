In its current form, it allows session\r\ninvitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered\r\nfrom one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the\r\nrecipient.  Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used\r\nfor malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service attacks.\r\nThis document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP\r\nthat add consent-based communications.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2006","keywords":["sip extensions"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4453","errata_url":null}
