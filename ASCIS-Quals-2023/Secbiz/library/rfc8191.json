During the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to\r\nkeep ongoing communications associated with the HoA.  However, the\r\ncurrent PMIPv6 specification does not specify related operations when\r\nHNP renumbering has occurred (e.g., due to change of service provider\r\nor site topology, etc.).  In this document, a solution to support HNP\r\nrenumbering is proposed, as an optional extension of the PMIPv6\r\nspecification.\r\n","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":["PMIPv6","HNP","HNP renumbering","LMA handover"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8191","errata_url":null}
