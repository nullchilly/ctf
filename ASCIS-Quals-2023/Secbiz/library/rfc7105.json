Location-related\r\nmeasurement information provides observations concerning properties\r\nrelated to the position of a Device; this information could be data\r\nabout network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is\r\nable to use the location-related measurement data to improve the\r\naccuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic\r\nset of location-related measurements are defined, including common\r\nmodes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation\r\nSatellite System (GNSS) parameters.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":["HELD","Location","Measurements","Device-based"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7105","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7105"}
