However,\r\nthe specifications are not completely clear about how the explicit\r\ntracking procedures work in certain scenarios.  This document\r\nprovides the necessary clarifications.  It also specifies a new,\r\noptimized explicit-tracking procedure.  This new procedure allows an\r\ningress node, by sending a single message, to request explicit\r\ntracking of each of a set of flows, where the set of flows is\r\nspecified using a wildcard mechanism.
