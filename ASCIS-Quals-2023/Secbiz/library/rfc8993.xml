      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">This document defines this reference model with more detail to allow for functional and protocol specifications to be developed in an architecturally consistent, non-overlapping manner. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">As discussed in <xref target="RFC7575" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7575"/>, the goal of this work is not to focus exclusively on fully autonomic nodes or networks. In reality, most networks will run with some autonomic functions, while the rest of the network is traditionally managed. This reference model allows for this hybrid approach. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">For example, it is possible in an existing, non-autonomic network to enroll devices in a traditional way to bring up a trust infrastructure with certificates. This trust infrastructure could then be used to automatically bring up an Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) and run traditional network operations over the secure and self-healing ACP. See <xref target="RFC8368" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8368"/> for a description of this use case.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">The scope of this model is therefore limited to networks that are to some extent managed by skilled human operators, loosely referred to as "professionally managed" networks. Unmanaged networks raise additional security and trust issues that this model does not cover.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">This document describes the first phase of an Autonomic Networking solution that is both simple and implementable.  It is expected that the experience from this phase will be used in defining updated and extended specifications over time. Some topics are considered architecturally in this document but are not yet reflected in the implementation specifications. They are marked with an (*).</t>

The adjacency table only contains information about other nodes that are capable of Autonomic Networking; non-autonomic nodes are normally not tracked here. 
However, the information is tracked independently of the status of the peer nodes; specifically, the adjacency table contains information about non-enrolled nodes of the same and other domains.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-2">First, discovering nodes and their properties and capabilities is a core function to establish an autonomic domain is the mutual discovery of autonomic nodes, primarily adjacent nodes and secondarily off-link peers.

An important point is that discovery must work in a network with no predefined topology, ideally no manual configuration of any kind, and with nodes starting up from factory condition or after any form of failure or sudden topology change.</t>

Autonomic nodes implementing a specific use case might choose their own signaling protocol, as long as it fits the overall security model. However, in the general case, any pair of autonomic nodes might need to communicate, so there needs to be a generic protocol for this. A prerequisite for this is that autonomic nodes can discover each other without any preconfiguration, as mentioned above. To be generic, discovery and signaling must be able to handle any sort of technical objective, including ones that require complex data structures.

these threads must be monitored for failures and hangups, and appropriate action taken.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   One of the goals of autonomic networking is to simplify the
   management of networks by human operators.  Intent Based Networking
   (IBN) is a possible approach to realize this goal.  With IBN, the
   operator indicates to the network what to do (i.e. her intent) and
   not how to do it.  In the field of Policy Based Management (PBM), the
   concept of intent is called a declarative policy.  This document
   proposes a refinement of the intent concept initially defined in
   [RFC7575] for autonomic networks by providing a more complete
   definition, a life-cycle, some use cases and a tentative format of
   the ANIMA Intent Policy.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   This document defines two YANG policy data modules. The first is a
   generic policy model that is meant to be extended on an application-
   specific basis. The second is an exemplary extension of the first
   generic policy model, and defines rules as event-condition-action
   policies. Both models are independent of the level of abstraction of
   the content and meaning of a policy.
