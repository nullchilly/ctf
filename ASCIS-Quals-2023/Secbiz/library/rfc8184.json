A Dual-Node Interconnection (DNI) PW is used to carry\r\ntraffic between the dual-homing Provider Edge (PE) nodes when a\r\nfailure occurs in one of the Attachment Circuits (AC) or PWs.  This\r\nPW dual-homing local protection mechanism is complementary to\r\nexisting PW protection mechanisms.","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":["mpls","mpls-tp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8184","errata_url":null}
