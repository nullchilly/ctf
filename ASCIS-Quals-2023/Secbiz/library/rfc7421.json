This\r\ndocument describes the advantages of this fixed boundary and analyzes\r\nthe issues that would be involved in treating it as a variable\r\nboundary.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7421","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7421"}
