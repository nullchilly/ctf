Reagle"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"16","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"XML Digital Signatures","abstract":" Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the \"xml:\" namespace.  However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and\/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
