This document builds on\r\nRFC 919 and describes a more efficient routing mechanism for\r\nbroadcast packets destined for multiple Local Area Networks (LANs)\r\nor Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) using an alternative link\r\nlayer.  It significantly reduces congestion on network equipment\r\nand does not require additional physical infrastructure investment.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"1 April 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6217","errata_url":null}
