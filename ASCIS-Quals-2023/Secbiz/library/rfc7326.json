The framework presents a physical reference model and\r\ninformation model.  The information model consists of an\r\nEnergy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects.  Each Energy\r\nObject can be attributed with identity, classification, and context.\r\nEnergy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to power,\r\nPower State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and battery.\r\nAdditionally, the framework models relationships and capabilities\r\nbetween Energy Objects.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7326","errata_url":null}
