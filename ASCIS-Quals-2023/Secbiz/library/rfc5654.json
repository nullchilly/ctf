This document is a product of a joint effort of the\r\nInternational Telecommunications Union (ITU) and IETF to include an\r\nMPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to\r\nsupport the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport\r\nnetwork as defined by International Telecommunications Union -\r\nTelecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T).\r\n\r\nThis work is based on two sources of requirements: MPLS and PWE3\r\narchitectures as defined by IETF, and packet transport networks as\r\ndefined by ITU-T.\r\n\r\nThe requirements expressed in this document are for the behavior of\r\nthe protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building\r\nblocks out of which the MPLS Transport Profile is constructed.  The\r\nrequirements are not implementation requirements.
