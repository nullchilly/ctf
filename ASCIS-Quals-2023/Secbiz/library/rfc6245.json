This specification defines a new Mobile\r\nIP extension that is used to exchange the value to be used in the GRE\r\nKey field.  This extension further allows the Mobility Agents to set\r\nup the necessary protocol interfaces prior to receiving the mobile\r\nnode traffic.  The new extension allows a Foreign Agent to request\r\nGRE tunneling without disturbing the Home Agent behavior specified\r\nfor Mobile IPv4.  GRE tunneling with the Key field allows the\r\noperators to have home networks that consist of multiple Virtual\r\nPrivate Networks (VPNs), which may have overlapping home addresses.\r\nWhen the tuple <Care of Address, Home Address, and Home Agent\r\nAddress> is the same across multiple subscriber sessions, GRE\r\ntunneling will provide a means for the Foreign Agent and Home Agent\r\nto identify data streams for the individual sessions based on the GRE\r\nkey.  In the absence of this key identifier, the data streams cannot\r\nbe distinguished from each other -- a significant drawback when using\r\nIP-in-IP tunneling.
