This document describes this issue and\r\ndiscusses operational workarounds that may help to improve network\r\nrobustness. Additionally, it highlights areas where further work may\r\nbe needed.","pub_date":"March 2021","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8978","errata_url":null}
