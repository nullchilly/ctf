LoST servers can be located anywhere, but a\r\nplacement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network, is\r\ndesirable.  In disaster situations with intermittent network\r\nconnectivity, such a LoST server placement provides benefits\r\nregarding the resiliency of emergency service communication.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST server\r\nusing the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
