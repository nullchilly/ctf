This specification describes how to create and process\r\nsignatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR\r\nfor serialization.  This specification additionally describes how to\r\nrepresent cryptographic keys using CBOR.  \r\n\r\nThis document, along with RFC 9053, obsoletes RFC 8152.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["Object Security","COSE","Constrained Devices"],"obsoletes":["RFC8152"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9338"],"see_also":["STD0096"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9052","errata_url":null}
