The\r\ncapability to specify different services in addition to the mobile\r\nnode's identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility for mobility\r\nservice providers to provide multiple services within a single\r\nmobility service subscription.  This document describes a Service\r\nSelection extension for Mobile IPv4 that is intended to assist home\r\nagents to make specific service selections for their mobility service\r\nsubscriptions during the registration procedure.
