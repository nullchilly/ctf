Service-specific\r\nconvergence sublayers to which upper-layer protocols interface are a\r\npart of the IEEE 802.16 MAC (Medium Access Control).  The Packet\r\nconvergence sublayer (CS) is used for the transport of all packet-\r\nbased protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and IEEE 802.3 LAN\/MAN\r\nCSMA\/CD Access Method (Ethernet).  IPv6 packets can be sent and\r\nreceived via the IP-specific part of the Packet CS.  This document\r\nspecifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IP-specific\r\npart of the Packet CS for hosts served by a network that utilizes the\r\nIEEE Std 802.16 air interface.  It recommends the assignment of a\r\nunique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows the host to use\r\nmultiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for\r\nrandomly generated interface identifiers.
