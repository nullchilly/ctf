Each set of addresses reports all\r\nof the addresses that designate the same interface (port) and also\r\nreports the TRILL switch by which that interface is reachable.  For\r\nexample, a 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address,\r\nand IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding to the same\r\ninterface reachable by a particular TRILL switch.  Such information\r\ncould be used in some cases to synthesize responses to, or bypass the\r\nneed for, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor\r\nDiscovery (ND) protocol, or the flooding of unknown MAC addresses.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["reachability","AFN","template"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7961","errata_url":null}
