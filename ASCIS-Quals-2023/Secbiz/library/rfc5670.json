This document defines the\r\ntwo metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering\r\nand -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate of PCN-traffic is\r\ngreater than a configured rate (\"PCN-threshold-rate\").  Excess-\r\ntraffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such\r\nthat the amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a\r\nconfigured rate (\"PCN-excess-rate\").  The level of marking allows\r\nPCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or\r\nterminate PCN-flows.
