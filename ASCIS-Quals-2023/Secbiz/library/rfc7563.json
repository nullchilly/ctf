This enables a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to convey\r\nidentifiers like the network identifier, geolocation, and operator\r\nidentifier.  This specification extends the Access Network Identifier\r\nmobility option with sub-options to carry the civic location and the\r\nMAG group identifier.  This specification also defines an ANI Update-Timer\r\nsub-option that determines when and how often the ANI option\r\nwill be updated.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6757"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7563","errata_url":null}
