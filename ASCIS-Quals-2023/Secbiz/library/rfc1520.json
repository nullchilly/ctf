First, it describes various alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information across domain boundaries, where one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and another is not.  Second, it addresses the implications of running CIDR- capable inter-domain routing protocols (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on intra- domain routing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
