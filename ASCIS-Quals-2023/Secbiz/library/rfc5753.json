The\r\nECC algorithms support the creation of digital signatures and the\r\nexchange of keys to encrypt or authenticate content.  The definition\r\nof the algorithm processing is based on the NIST FIPS 186-3 for\r\ndigital signature, NIST SP800-56A and SEC1 for key agreement, RFC\r\n3370 and RFC 3565 for key wrap and content encryption, NIST FIPS\r\n180-3 for message digest, SEC1 for key derivation, and RFC 2104 and RFC\r\n4231 for message authentication code standards.
