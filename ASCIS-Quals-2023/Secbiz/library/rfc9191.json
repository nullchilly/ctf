EAP-TLS and other TLS-based EAP methods are widely deployed\r\nand used for network access authentication. Large certificates and\r\nlong certificate chains combined with authenticators that drop an EAP\r\nsession after only 40 - 50 round trips is a major deployment problem.\r\nThis document looks at this problem in detail and describes the\r\npotential solutions available.","pub_date":"February 2022","keywords":["EAP-TLS","X.509","EAP","authenticator","Maximum Transmission Unit","(MTU)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9191","errata_url":null}
