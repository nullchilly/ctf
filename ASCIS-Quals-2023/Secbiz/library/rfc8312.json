It differs from\r\nthe current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on\r\nthe sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of\r\na linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to\r\nimprove scalability and stability under fast and long-distance\r\nnetworks.  CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as\r\ndefaults by Linux and have been used for many years.  This document\r\nprovides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party\r\nimplementations and to solicit community feedback through\r\nexperimentation on the performance of CUBIC.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9438"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8312","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8312"}
