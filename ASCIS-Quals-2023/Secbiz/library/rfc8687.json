In order\r\nto achieve an integrated MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must\r\nbe computed over MPLS TE tunnels created using information propagated\r\nin another OSPF instance. This issue is solved by advertising\r\ncross-address family (X-AF) OSPF TE information.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an update to RFC 5786 that allows for the\r\neasy identification of a router's local X-AF IP addresses.","pub_date":"November 2019","keywords":["OSPF","IPv4","IPv6","TE","MPLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5786"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8687","errata_url":null}
