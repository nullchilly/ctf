For example, it will typically require an IP address\r\nand the address of a DNS server.  This information is configured\r\nstatically or obtained dynamically using Dynamic Host Configuration\r\nProtocol (DHCP) or Point-to-Point Protocol\/IP Control Protocol\r\n(PPP\/IPCP).  However, both DHCP and PPP\/IPCP provide host\r\nconfiguration based on the access network.  In Mobile IPv4, the\r\nregistration process boots up a Mobile Node at an access network, also\r\nknown as a foreign network.  The information to configure the host\r\nneeds to be based on the home network.  This document describes the\r\nCisco vendor-specific extensions to Mobile IPv4 to provide the base\r\nhost configuration in Registration Request and Reply messages.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["dynamic host configuration protocol","dhcp","point-to-point","ip control protocol","ppp","ipcp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4332","errata_url":null}
