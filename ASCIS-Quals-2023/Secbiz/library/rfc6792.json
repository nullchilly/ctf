In this\r\nframework, a new XR block should contain a single metric or a small\r\nnumber of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest or\r\nconcern, rather than containing a number of metrics that attempt to\r\nprovide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a\r\nspecific application.  Applications may then \"mix and match\" to\r\ncreate a set of blocks that cover their set of concerns.  Where\r\npossible, a specific block should be designed to be reusable across\r\nmore than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming\r\naudio, and video.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2012","keywords":["Real Time Control Protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6792","errata_url":null}
