Therefore, this document\r\nrequests that RFC 3068 (\"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers\")\r\nand RFC 6732 (\"6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels\") be made obsolete and\r\nmoved to Historic status.  It recommends that future products should\r\nnot support 6to4 anycast and that existing deployments should be\r\nreviewed.  This complements the guidelines in RFC 6343.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC3068","RFC6732"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0196"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7526","errata_url":null}
