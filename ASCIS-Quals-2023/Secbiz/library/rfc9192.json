MD\r\nType 0x1 uses a fixed-length Context Header. The allocation of this\r\nContext Header, i.e., its structure and semantics, has not been\r\nstandardized. This memo defines the Timestamp Context Header, which\r\nis an NSH fixed-length Context Header that incorporates the packet's\r\ntimestamp, a sequence number, and a source interface identifier.\r\n\r\nAlthough the definition of the Context Header presented in this\r\ndocument has not been standardized by the IETF, it has been\r\nimplemented in silicon by several manufacturers and is published here\r\nto facilitate interoperability.","pub_date":"February 2022","keywords":["NSH","Context Header","timestamp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9192","errata_url":null}
