Each mobile\r\nnode is always identified by its home address, regardless of its\r\ncurrent point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away\r\nfrom its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of\r\naddress, which provides information about its current point of\r\nattachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering\r\nthe care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends\r\ndatagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the\r\ncare-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each\r\ndatagram is then delivered to the mobile node.
