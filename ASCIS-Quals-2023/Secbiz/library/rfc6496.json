As\r\ndefined today, SEND assumes that the node sending an ND message is\r\nthe owner of the address from which the message is sent and\/or\r\npossesses a key that authorizes the node to act as a router, so that\r\nit is in possession of the private key or keys used to generate the\r\ndigital signature on each message.  This means that the Proxy ND\r\nsignaling performed by nodes that do not possess knowledge of the\r\naddress owner's private key and\/or knowledge of a router's key cannot\r\nbe secured using SEND.  This document extends the current SEND\r\nspecification in order to secure Proxy ND operation.  This document \r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["[--------]","SPND","CGA","Mobile IPv6","MIPv6","Proxy Mobile IPv6","PMIPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6496","errata_url":null}
