The option is passed\r\nbetween the DHCPv4 Client and the DHCPv4 Server to request dynamic\r\nallocation of a subnet, give specifications of the subnet(s)\r\nallocated, and report usage statistics.  This memo documents the\r\ncurrent usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942, which\r\ndeclares that any preexisting usages of option numbers in the range\r\n128-223 should be documented and that the working group will try to\r\nofficially assign those numbers to those options.  This document is \r\nnot an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for \r\ninformational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6656","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6656"}
