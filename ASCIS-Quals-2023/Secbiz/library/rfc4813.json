OSPF routers exchange information on a link using packets\r\nthat follow a well-defined format.  The format of OSPF packets is not\r\nflexible enough to enable applications to exchange arbitrary data, which\r\nmay be necessary in certain situations.  This memo describes a\r\nvendor-specific, backward-compatible technique to perform link-local\r\nsignaling, i.e., exchange arbitrary data on a link.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2007","keywords":["[--------]","open shortest path first"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5613"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4813","errata_url":null}
