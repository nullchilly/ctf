The first extension\r\ndefines the new switching type Data Channel Switching Capable.\r\nData Channel Switching Capable interfaces are able to support\r\nswitching of the whole digital channel presented on single channel\r\ninterfaces.  The second extension defines a new type of\r\ngeneralized label and updates related objects.  The new label is\r\ncalled the Generalized Channel_Set Label and allows more than one\r\ndata plane label to be controlled as part of a Label Switched Path (LSP).\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["[--------]","Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3471","RFC3473","RFC3945","RFC4202","RFC4203","RFC5307"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6002","errata_url":null}
