The solution relies on RSVP-TE without requiring a\r\nmulticast routing protocol in the Service Provider core.  Protocol\r\nelements and procedures for this solution are described.\r\n\r\nThere can be various applications for P2MP TE LSPs such as IP\r\nmulticast.  Specification of how such applications will use a P2MP TE\r\nLSP is outside the scope of this document.
