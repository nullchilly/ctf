To maintain accurate\r\nname-to-IP-address and IP-address-to-name mappings in the DNS, these\r\ndynamically assigned addresses and fully qualified domain names\r\n(FQDNs) require updates to the DNS.  This document identifies\r\nsituations in which conflicts in the use of fully qualified domain\r\nnames may arise among DHCP clients and servers, and it describes a\r\nstrategy for the use of the DHCID DNS resource record (RR) in\r\nresolving those conflicts.
