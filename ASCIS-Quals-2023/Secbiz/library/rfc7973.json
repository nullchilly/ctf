The IETF\r\nofficially requested the assignment of an Ethertype for that purpose\r\nand this document reports that assignment.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":["6lowpan","header compression","ethertype"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7973","errata_url":null}
