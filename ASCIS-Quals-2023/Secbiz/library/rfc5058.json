This document describes\r\nXcast (Explicit Multi-unicast), a new multicast scheme with\r\ncomplementary scaling properties: Xcast supports a very large number\r\nof small multicast sessions.  Xcast achieves this by explicitly\r\nencoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead of\r\nusing a multicast group address.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses Xcast concepts and options in several areas;\r\nit does not provide a complete technical specification.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","explicit multi-unicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5058","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5058"}
