      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This memo describes the guidelines to help with evaluating
            new congestion control algorithms for interactive
            point-to-point real-time media. The requirements for the
            congestion control algorithm are outlined in <xref target="RFC8836" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8836"/>. This document
            builds upon previous work at the IETF: <xref target="RFC5033" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5033">Specifying New Congestion Control
            Algorithms</xref> and <xref target="RFC5166" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5166">Metrics for the
            Evaluation of Congestion Control Algorithms</xref>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The guidelines proposed in the document are intended to help
            prevent a congestion collapse, to promote fair capacity usage, and
            to optimize the media flow's throughput.  Furthermore, the proposed
            congestion control algorithms are expected to operate within the envelope of the
            circuit breakers defined in RFC 8083 <xref target="RFC8083" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8083"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document only provides the broad set of network
            parameters and traffic models for evaluating a new
            congestion control algorithm.  The minimal requirement
            for congestion control proposals is to produce or present
            results for the test scenarios described in <xref target="RFC8867" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8867"/> (Basic Test Cases),
            which also defines the specifics for the test cases.
            Additionally, proponents may produce evaluation results
            for the <xref target="RFC8869" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8869">

	      This document does not cover application-specific
	      implications of congestion control algorithms and how
	      those could be evaluated.  Therefore, no quality metrics
	      are defined for performance evaluation; quality metrics
	      and the algorithms to infer those vary between media types.
	      Metrics and algorithms to assess, e.g., the quality of
	      experience, evolve continuously so that determining
	      suitable choices is left for future work. However, there
	      is consensus that each congestion control algorithm
	      should be able to show that it is useful for interactive
	      video by performing analysis using real codecs and
	      video sequences and state-of-the-art quality metrics.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">
	      Beyond optimizing individual metrics, real-time
	      applications may have further options to trade off
	      performance, e.g., across multiple media; refer to the
	      <xref target="RFC8836" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8836">RMCAT
	      requirements</xref> document.  Such trade-offs may be

        document. When jitter is to be applied to both the congestion-controlled RTP flow and any
        competing flow (such as a TCP competing flow), the competing flow will
        use the jitter definition below that does not allow for reordering of
        packets on the competing flow (see NR-BPDV definition below).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-2">Jitter is an overloaded term in communications. It is
        typically used to refer to the variation of a metric (e.g.,
        delay) with respect to some reference metric (e.g., average
        delay or minimum delay). For example in RFC 3550, jitter is
        computed as the smoothed difference in packet arrival times
        relative to their respective expected arrival times, which is
        particularly meaningful if the underlying packet delay
        variation was caused by a Gaussian random process.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-3">Because jitter is an overloaded term, we use the term
        Packet Delay Variation (PDV) instead to describe the variation
        of delay of individual packets in the same sense as the IETF
        IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has defined PDV in their documents (e.g., RFC 3393)
        and as the ITU-T SG16 has defined IP Packet Delay Variation
        (IPDV) in their documents (e.g., Y.1540).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-4">Most PDV distributions in packet network systems are
        one-sided distributions, the measurement of which with a
        finite number of measurement samples results in one-sided
        histograms. In the usual packet network transport case, there
        is typically one packet that transited the network with the
        minimum delay; a (large) number of packets transit the network
        within some (smaller) positive variation from this minimum
        delay, and a (small) number of the packets transit the network
        with delays higher than the median or average transit time
        (these are outliers). Although infrequent, outliers can cause
        significant deleterious operation in adaptive systems and
        should be considered in rate adaptation designs for RTP

        For example, the minimum value, x_min, might be specified as the
        minimum transit time packet, and the maximum value, x_max, might be
        defined to be two standard deviations higher than the mean.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5.1-2">Since we are typically interested in the distribution relative to
        the mean delay packet, we define the zero mean PDV sample, z(n), to be
        z(n) = x(n) - x_mean, where x(n) is a sample of the RBPDV random
        variable x and x_mean is the mean of x.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5.1-3">We assume here that s(n) is the original source time of packet n
        and the post-jitter induced emission time, j(n), for packet n is:

	  It follows that the separation in the post-jitter time of
	  packets n and n+1 is {[s(n+1)-s(n)] - [z(n)-z(n+1)]}. Since
	  the first term is always a positive quantity, we note that
	  packet reordering at the receiver is possible whenever the
	  second term is greater than the first. Said another way,
	  whenever the difference in possible zero mean PDV sample
	  delays (i.e., [x_max-x_min]) exceeds the inter-departure
	  time of any two sent packets, we have the possibility of
	  packet reordering.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5.1-6">There are important use cases in real networks where packets can
        become reordered, such as in load-balancing topologies and during
        route changes. However, for the vast majority of cases, there is no
        packet reordering because most of the time packets follow the same
        path. Due to this, if a packet becomes overly delayed, the packets
        after it on that flow are also delayed. This is especially true for
        mobile wireless links where there are per-flow queues prior to base
        station scheduling. Owing to this important use case, we define
        another PDV profile similar to the above, but one that does not allow

          one important exception. Let serial(n) be defined as the serialization
          delay of packet n at the lowest bottleneck link rate (or other
          appropriate rate) in a given test. Then we produce all the post-jitter
          values for j(n) for n = 1, 2, ... N, where N is the length of the
          source sequence s to be offset. The exception can be stated as
          follows: We revisit all j(n) beginning from index n=2, and if j(n) is
          determined to be less than [j(n-1)+serial(n-1)], we redefine j(n) to
          be equal to [j(n-1)+serial(n-1)] and continue for all remaining n
          (i.e., n = 3, 4, .. N). This models the case where the packet n is
          sent immediately after packet (n-1) at the bottleneck link rate.
          Although this is generally the theoretical minimum in that it assumes
          that no other packets from other flows are in between packet n and n+1
          at the bottleneck link, it is a reasonable assumption for per-flow
          queuing.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5.2-2">We note that this assumption holds for some important exception
          cases, such as packets immediately following outliers. There are a
          multitude of software-controlled elements common on end-to-end
          Internet paths (such as firewalls, application-layer gateways, and other middleboxes) that
          stop processing packets while servicing other functions (e.g., garbage
          collection). Often these devices do not drop packets, but rather queue
          them for later processing and cause many of the outliers. Thus NR-BPDV
          models this particular use case (assuming serial(n+1) is defined
          appropriately for the device causing the outlier) and is believed
          to be important for adaptation development for congestion-controlled RTP streams.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

              <t indent="0">This document describes a profile called "RTP/AVP" for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.  It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.  The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  Such applications are often run on best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control is not implemented in these applications, then network congestion can lead to uncontrolled packet loss and a resulting deterioration of the user's multimedia experience.  The congestion control algorithm acts as a safety measure by stopping RTP flows from using excessive resources and protecting the network from overload.  At the time of this writing, however, while there are several proprietary solutions, there is no standard algorithm for congestion control of interactive RTP flows.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm.  It instead defines a minimal set of RTP circuit breakers: conditions under which an RTP sender needs to stop transmitting media data to protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that, in the absence of long-lived excessive congestion, RTP applications running on best-effort IP networks will be able to operate without triggering these circuit breakers.  To avoid triggering the RTP circuit breaker, any Standards Track congestion control algorithms defined for RTP will need to operate within the envelope set by these RTP circuit breaker algorithms.</t>

              <t indent="0">The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).  Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet.  These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router.  This document is the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG).  As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like.  However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards.  It differs from the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long-distance networks.  CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as defaults by Linux and have been used for many years.  This document provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party implementations and to solicit community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.</t>
