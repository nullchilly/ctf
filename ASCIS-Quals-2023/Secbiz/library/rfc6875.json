These experiments were\r\nperformed in Japan by the P2P Network Experiment Council in an\r\nattempt to harmonize peer-to-peer (P2P) technology with network\r\ninfrastructure.  Based on what was learned from these experiments,\r\nthis document provides some suggestions that might be useful for the\r\nALTO architecture and especially for application-independent ALTO-\r\nlike server operation.","pub_date":"February 2013","keywords":["overlay network","content delivery network","peer-to-peer","traffic engineering","experiments in Japan"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6875","errata_url":null}
