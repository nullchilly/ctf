The architecture is given at a high level, showing the\r\nmajor components of an overall system.  An important goal is to\r\ndivide the space into individual smaller components that can be\r\nimplemented independently with clear inter-component interfaces and\r\ninteractions.  It should be possible to build and implement\r\nindividual components in isolation and have them interoperate with\r\nother independently implemented components.  That way, implementers\r\nhave flexibility in implementing individual components and can\r\noptimize and innovate within their respective components without\r\nrequiring changes to other components.","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8014","errata_url":null}
