Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for\r\nbeing well connected because topological richness amplifies the\r\nnumber of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD\r\noff.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends\r\nadjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits in order to\r\nreduce the high risks with RFD.  The result is damping a non-trivial\r\namount of long-term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes'\r\nnormal convergence process.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["rfd"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7196","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7196"}
