It does\r\nso by running an independent Asynchronous mode BFD session on every\r\nLAG member link.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism allows the verification of member link continuity,\r\neither in combination with, or in absence of, Link Aggregation\r\nControl Protocol (LACP).  It provides a shorter detection time than\r\nwhat LACP offers.  The continuity check can also cover elements of\r\nLayer 3 (L3) bidirectional forwarding.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7130","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7130"}
