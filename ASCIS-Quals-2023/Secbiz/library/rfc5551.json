Notifications make\r\nthe client aware of significant events (such as the arrival of new\r\nmail) so it can react (such as by fetching interesting mail\r\nimmediately).  Filtering reduces the visible mail to a set of messages\r\nthat meet some criteria for \"interesting\".  This functionality is\r\nincluded in the goals of the Lemonade (Enhancements to Internet email\r\nto Support Diverse Service Environments) Working Group.\r\n\r\nThis document also discusses the use of server-to-server\r\nnotifications, and how server to server notifications fit into an\r\narchitecture that provides server to client notifications.  This \r\nmemo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2009","keywords":["notification","filtering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5551","errata_url":null}
