The\r\nResource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast\r\n(PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast\r\nListener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and\r\nGeneral Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols\r\nthat make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses\r\nsecurity aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current\r\nIP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711.\r\nSpecifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router\r\nAlert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled\r\nenvironments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used\r\nsafely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches\r\nfor service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for\r\nRouter Alert implementation on routers.  This memo documents an Internet \r\nBest Current Practice.","pub_date":"October 2011","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2113","RFC2711"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0168"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6398","errata_url":null}
