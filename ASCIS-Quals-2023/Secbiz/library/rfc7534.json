Examples are the addresses designated in\r\nRFC 1918 for private use within individual sites.\r\n\r\nDevices in such environments may occasionally originate Domain Name\r\nSystem (DNS) queries (so-called \"reverse lookups\") corresponding to\r\nthose private-use addresses.  Since the addresses concerned have only\r\nlocal significance, it is good practice for site administrators to\r\nensure that such queries are answered locally.  However, it is not\r\nuncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the\r\npublic DNS instead of being answered within the site.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to\r\nsuch queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use\r\naddresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of\r\nsuch queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide\r\na distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on\r\nthe corresponding authoritative servers.  The AS112 project is named\r\nafter the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the steps required to install a new AS112\r\nnode and offers advice relating to such a node's operation.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6304.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["AS112","DNS","reverse DNS","anycast"],"obsoletes":["RFC6304"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7534","errata_url":null}
