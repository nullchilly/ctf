The purpose of this extension is\r\nto provide an extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request\r\nnotification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nNote that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT\r\nintended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of\r\nevent subscription and notification.\r\n\r\nThis document represents a backwards-compatible improvement on the\r\noriginal mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account several\r\nyears of implementation experience.  Accordingly, this document\r\nobsoletes RFC 3265.  This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to\r\naccommodate some small changes to the mechanism that were discussed\r\nin that document.
