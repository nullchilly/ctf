Also,\r\nprovision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless\r\noperation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains.  This\r\nprotocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media\r\nGateway Controller (MGC) or IP-resident Database, or between two\r\nIP-based applications.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7\r\nsignalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message\r\nTransfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.  This document obsoletes\r\nRFC 3332.
