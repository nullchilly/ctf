In PCEP, the path computation requests carry\r\ndetails of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC wishes\r\nthe PCE to apply in its computation.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information\r\nin PCEP using a dedicated object and a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) that\r\ncan be carried in any PCEP object that supports TLVs.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 7150.  The only changes from that document\r\nare a clarification of the use of the new Type-Length-Value and the allocation\r\nof a different code point for the VENDOR-INFORMATION object.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC7150"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7470","errata_url":null}
