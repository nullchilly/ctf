However, some services use an operational convention for\r\ndefining specific interpretations of an RRset by locating the records\r\nin a DNS branch under the parent domain to which the RRset actually\r\napplies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming\r\nconvention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with the\r\nunderscore character (e.g., \"_name\").  The underscored naming\r\nconstruct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are\r\nassociated with the parent domain above the underscored branch.  This\r\nspecification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the\r\n\"Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names\" registry with IANA.\r\nThe purpose of this registry is to avoid collisions resulting from\r\nthe use of the same underscored name for different services.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["DNS","Domain Name System"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0222"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8552","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8552"}
