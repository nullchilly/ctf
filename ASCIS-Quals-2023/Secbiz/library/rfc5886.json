Path Computation Clients (PCCs) send computation\r\nrequests to PCEs, and these may forward the requests to and cooperate with\r\nother PCEs forming a \"path computation chain\".\r\n\r\nIn PCE-based environments, it is thus critical to monitor the state\r\nof the path computation chain for troubleshooting and performance\r\nmonitoring purposes: liveness of each element (PCE) involved in the\r\nPCE chain and detection of potential resource contention states and\r\nstatistics in terms of path computation times are examples of such\r\nmetrics of interest.  This document specifies procedures and\r\nextensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order\r\nto gather such information.
