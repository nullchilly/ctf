It preserves the reliable, in-order delivery\r\nof TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record\r\nboundaries that DDP requires.  MPA is fully compliant with applicable\r\nTCP RFCs and can be utilized with existing TCP implementations.  MPA\r\nalso supports integrated implementations that combine TCP, MPA and DDP\r\nto reduce buffering requirements in the implementation and improve\r\nperformance at the system level.
