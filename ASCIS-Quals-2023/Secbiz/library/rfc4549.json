In particular, it deals with the\r\nissues of what might be called the \"driver\" portion of the synchronization\r\ntool: the portion of the code responsible for issuing the correct set\r\nof IMAP4 commands to synchronize the disconnected client in the way\r\nthat is most likely to make the human who uses the disconnected\r\nclient happy.\r\n\r\nThis note describes different strategies that can be used by disconnected\r\nclients and shows how to use IMAP protocol in order to minimize the\r\ntime of the synchronization process.\r\n\r\nThis note also lists IMAP extensions that a server should implement in\r\norder to provide better synchronization facilities to disconnected clients.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2006","keywords":["internet message access protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4549","errata_url":null}
