The emerging field of Identity-Based\r\nEncryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of infrastructure\r\nrequirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while providing the\r\nsame flexibility.  However, one significant limitation of\r\nIBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a\r\nde facto key escrow server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed\r\ndeficiency is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating\r\nparties.  This document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key\r\nExchange (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow\r\nproblem and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect\r\nforward and backward secrecy.  This document is not an Internet Standards\r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2012","keywords":["ibe","identity based encryption"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6539","errata_url":null}
