The different PW control plane domains may belong to\r\nindependent autonomous systems, or the PSN technology is\r\nheterogeneous, or a PW might need to be aggregated at a specific PSN\r\npoint.  The PW packet data units are simply switched from one PW to\r\nanother without changing the PW payload.
