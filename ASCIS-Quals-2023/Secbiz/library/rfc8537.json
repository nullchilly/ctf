When an associated bidirectional LSP\r\nis co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path as its forward\r\nLSP.  This document updates the fast reroute procedures defined in\r\nRFC 4090 to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned\r\nassociated bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the\r\nprocedure for associating two reverse LSPs defined in RFC 7551 to\r\nsupport co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The fast reroute procedures\r\ncan ensure that, for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed\r\npaths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure event.","pub_date":"February 2019","keywords":["RSVP-TE LSP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4090","RFC7551"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8537","errata_url":null}
