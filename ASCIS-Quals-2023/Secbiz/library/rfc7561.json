RFC 7222 describes QoS negotiation\r\nbetween a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA)\r\nin a PMIPv6 mobility domain.  The negotiated QoS parameters can be\r\nused for QoS policing and marking of packets to enforce QoS\r\ndifferentiation on the path between the MAG and LMA.  IEEE 802.11 and\r\nWi-Fi Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describe methods for\r\nQoS negotiation between a Wi-Fi Station (MN in PMIPv6 terminology)\r\nand an Access Point.  This document provides a mapping between the\r\nabove two sets of QoS procedures and the associated QoS parameters.\r\nThis document is intended to be used as a companion document to RFC\r\n7222 to enable implementation of end-to-end QoS.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["PMIPv6","Wi-Fi","QoS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7561","errata_url":null}
