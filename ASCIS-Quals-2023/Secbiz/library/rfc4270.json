This\r\ndocument summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols, discusses\r\nhow the collision attacks affect and do not affect the protocols,\r\nshows how to thwart known attacks on digital certificates, and\r\ndiscusses future directions for protocol designers.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2005","keywords":["collision attacks","hash algorithms","ip","digital certificates"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4270","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4270"}
