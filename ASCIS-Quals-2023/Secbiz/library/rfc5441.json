In this context, a domain is a\r\ncollection of network elements within a common sphere of address\r\nmanagement or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area\r\nor an Autonomous Systems.  This document specifies a procedure\r\nrelying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to\r\ncompute such inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a\r\npredetermined sequence of domains, using a backward-recursive path\r\ncomputation technique.  This technique preserves confidentiality\r\nacross domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed\r\nby different service providers.
