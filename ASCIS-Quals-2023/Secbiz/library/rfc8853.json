This is called simulcast. This document describes how to\r\naccomplish simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in the Session\r\nDescription Protocol (SDP).  The described solution uses an RTP\/RTCP\r\nidentification method to identify RTP streams belonging to the same\r\nmedia source and makes an extension to SDP to indicate that those RTP\r\nstreams are different simulcast formats of that media source. The SDP\r\nextension consists of a new media-level SDP attribute that expresses\r\ncapability to send and\/or receive simulcast RTP streams.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8853","errata_url":null}
