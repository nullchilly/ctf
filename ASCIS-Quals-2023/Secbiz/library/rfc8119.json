This document updates RFC\r\n4458 by creating a new predefined value for the \"cause\" URI parameter\r\nto cover service number translation for cases of retargeting due to\r\nspecific service action leading to the translation of a called\r\nservice access number.  This document also provides guidance, which\r\nwas missing in RFC 4458, for using the \"cause\" URI parameter within\r\nthe History-Info header field, since this use is mandatory in some IP\r\nnetworks' implementations.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["Cause"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4458"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8119","errata_url":null}
