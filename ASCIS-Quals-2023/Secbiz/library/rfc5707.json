The MSML control\r\ninterface was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant\r\ncontributions from Intel, Dialogic, and others in the\r\nindustry.  Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions\r\ninteract on a media server and to apply services to individuals or\r\ngroups of users.  MSML can be used, for example, to control media\r\nserver conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing,\r\ncreate sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties\r\nof media streams.  As well, clients can use MSML to define media\r\nprocessing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application\r\ninteractions with users or conferences.  Transformation of media\r\nstreams to and from users or conferences as well as interactive voice\r\nresponse (IVR) dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are\r\nspecified using MSML.  MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with\r\nindividual users or with groups of conference participants using\r\nVoiceXMLThis document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5707","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5707"}
