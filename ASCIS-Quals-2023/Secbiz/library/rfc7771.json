However, static\r\nMS-PWs are not protected end-to-end against failure of one of the\r\nSwitching Provider Edge Routers (S-PEs) along the path of the\r\nMS-PW.  This document describes how to achieve this protection via\r\nredundant MS-PWs by updating the existing procedures in RFC 6870.\r\nIt also contains an optional approach based on MPLS-TP Linear\r\nProtection.","pub_date":"January 2016","keywords":["end-to-end protection","linear protection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6870"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7771","errata_url":null}
