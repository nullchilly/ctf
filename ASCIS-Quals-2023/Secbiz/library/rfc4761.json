The service offers a Layer 2 Virtual\r\nPrivate Network (VPN); however, in the case of VPLS, the customers in\r\nthe VPN are connected by a multipoint Ethernet LAN, in contrast to\r\nthe usual Layer 2 VPNs, which are point-to-point in nature.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the functions required to offer VPLS, a\r\nmechanism for signaling a VPLS, and rules for forwarding VPLS frames\r\nacross a packet switched network.
