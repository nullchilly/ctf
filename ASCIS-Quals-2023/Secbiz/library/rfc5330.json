By making\r\nstatistical assumptions about the aggregated traffic carried onto a\r\nset of TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) signalled with zero bandwidth\r\n(referred to as \"unconstrained TE LSP\" in this document), algorithms\r\ncan be designed to load balance (existing or newly configured)\r\nunconstrained TE LSP across a set of equal cost paths.  This requires\r\nknowledge of the number of unconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.\r\nThis document specifies a new Link-type\r\nTraffic Engineering sub-TLV used to advertise the number of\r\nunconstrained TE LSPs signalled across a link.
