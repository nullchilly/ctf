This\r\ndocument describes the architecture of the SSH protocol, as well as\r\nthe notation and terminology used in SSH protocol documents.  It also\r\ndiscusses the SSH algorithm naming system that allows local extensions.  The SSH\r\nprotocol consists of three major components: The Transport Layer\r\nProtocol provides server authentication, confidentiality, and\r\nintegrity with perfect forward secrecy.  The User Authentication\r\nProtocol authenticates the client to the server.  The Connection\r\nProtocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into several logical\r\nchannels.  Details of these protocols are described in separate\r\ndocuments.
