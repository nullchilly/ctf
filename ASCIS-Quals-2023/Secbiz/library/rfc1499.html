<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1498" href="#section-1498">1498</a>    Saltzer  </span>    Aug 93   On the Naming and Binding of Network
                              Destinations

This brief paper offers a perspective on the subject of names of
destinations in data communication networks. It suggests two ideas:
First, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of
objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network.
Second, the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to
describe the relations among the four kinds of objects.  This memo
provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an
Internet standard.

Since the introduction of X.400(84), there has been work ongoing for
defining mappings between MHS and <a href="./rfc822">RFC-822</a>.  The most recent work in this
area is <a href="./rfc1327">RFC-1327</a> [3], which focuses primarily on translation of envelope

Though the proposed character set "koi8-r" is not currently an
international standard, there is very large user community (including
Relcom Net) supporting it.  Factually, "koi8-r" is de-facto standard for
Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.  This
is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes "koi8-r"
should be registered.  This memo provides information for the Internet
