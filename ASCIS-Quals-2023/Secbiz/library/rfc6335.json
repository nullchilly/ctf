It also discusses the rationale and principles\r\nbehind these procedures and how they facilitate the long-term\r\nsustainability of the registry.\r\n\r\nThis document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting the previous\r\nUDP and TCP port assignment procedures defined in Sections 8 and 9.1\r\nof the IANA Allocation Guidelines, and it updates the IANA service\r\nname and port assignment procedures for UDP-Lite, the Datagram\r\nCongestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and the Stream Control\r\nTransmission Protocol (SCTP).  It also updates the DNS SRV\r\nspecification to clarify what a service name is and how it is\r\nregistered.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.","pub_date":"August 2011","keywords":["IANA","transport","ports","port numbers","allocation","assignment","procedures"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2780","RFC2782","RFC3828","RFC4340","RFC4960","RFC5595"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0165"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6335","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6335"}
