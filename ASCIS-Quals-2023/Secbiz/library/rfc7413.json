TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets\r\nand consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection\r\nhandshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to\r\nthe standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to\r\ncomplete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the\r\nstandard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to\r\nan application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not\r\nuse TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the\r\nApplicability section.","pub_date":"December 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7413","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7413"}
