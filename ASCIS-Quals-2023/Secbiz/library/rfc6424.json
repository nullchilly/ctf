The techniques outlined in RFC\r\n4379 are insufficient to perform traceroute Forwarding Equivalency\r\nClass (FEC) validation and path discovery for an LSP that goes over\r\nother MPLS tunnels or for a stitched LSP.  This document deprecates\r\nthe Downstream Mapping TLV (defined in RFC 4379) in favor of a new\r\nTLV that, along with other procedures outlined in this document, can\r\nbe used to trace such LSPs.
