Now that\r\nthere are no longer any unallocated IPv4 \/8s, this practise is more\r\ncomplicated, fragile, and expensive.  Network administrators are\r\nadvised to remove filters based on the registration status of the\r\naddress space.\r\n\r\nThis document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix\r\nfilters for unallocated IPv4 \/8s should now be removed on border\r\nrouters and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be\r\nrouted across the public Internet.  This memo documents an Internet \r\nBest Current Practice.","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":["[--------]","bogons","IPv4","martians","filters"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0171"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6441","errata_url":null}
