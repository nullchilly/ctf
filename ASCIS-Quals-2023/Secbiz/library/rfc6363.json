The framework\r\nsupports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable\r\ntransport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming,\r\nmedia.  This framework can be used to define Content Delivery\r\nProtocols that provide FEC for streaming media delivery or other\r\npacket flows.  Content Delivery Protocols defined using this\r\nframework can support any FEC scheme (and associated FEC codes) that\r\nis compliant with various requirements defined in this document.\r\nThus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined that are not specific\r\nto a particular FEC scheme, and FEC schemes can be defined that are\r\nnot specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2011","keywords":["[--------]","Reliable streaming","content delivery","FEC schemes"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8680"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6363","errata_url":null}
