These include support\r\nfor requesting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections including\r\nSynchronous Optical Network (SONET)\/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\r\n(SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).\r\n\r\nThis document concentrates on the routing requirements placed on the\r\nGMPLS suite of protocols in order to support the capabilities and\r\nfunctionalities of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON)\r\nas defined by the ITU-T.
