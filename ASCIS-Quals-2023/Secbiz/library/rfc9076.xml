   of <xref target="RFC6973" sectionFormat="of" section="8" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6973#section-8" derivedContent="RFC6973"/>. 
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The Domain Name System (DNS) is specified in <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/>, <xref target="RFC1035" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1035"/>, and
   many later RFCs, which have never been consolidated. It is one of the most
   important infrastructure components of the Internet and is often ignored or
   misunderstood by Internet users (and even by many professionals). Almost
   every activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often several).
   Its use has many privacy implications, and this document is an attempt at a
   comprehensive and accurate list.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Let us begin with a simplified reminder of how the DNS works (see also
   <xref target="RFC8499" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8499"/>). A client, the stub resolver, issues a
   DNS query to a server called the recursive resolver (also called caching
   resolver, full resolver, or recursive name server). Let's use the query
   "What are the AAAA records for www.example.com?" as an example. AAAA is the
   QTYPE (Query Type), and www.example.com is the QNAME (Query Name). (The
   description that follows assumes a cold cache, for instance, because the
   server just started.) The recursive resolver will first query the root name
   servers. In most cases, the root name servers will send a referral. In this
   example, the referral will be to the .com name servers. The resolver repeats
   the query to one of the .com name servers. The .com name servers, in turn,
   will refer to the example.com name servers. The example.com name servers will
   then return the answers. The root name servers, the name servers of .com, and
   the name servers of example.com are called authoritative name servers. It is
   important, when analyzing the privacy issues, to remember that the question
   asked to all these name servers is always the original question, not a
   derived question. The question sent to the root name servers is "What are
   the AAAA records for www.example.com?", not "What are the name servers of
   .com?". By repeating the full question, instead of just the relevant part of
   the question to the next in line, the DNS provides more information than
   necessary to the name server. In this simplified description, recursive
   resolvers do not implement QNAME minimization as described in <xref target="RFC7816" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7816"/>,
   which will only send the relevant part of the question to the upstream name
   server.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">DNS relies heavily on caching, so the algorithm described
   above is actually a bit more complicated, and not all questions are
   sent to the authoritative name servers.  If the
   stub resolver asks the recursive resolver a few seconds later, "What are the SRV records
   of _xmpp-server._tcp.example.com?", the recursive resolver will
   remember that it knows the name servers of example.com and will just
   query them, bypassing the root and .com.  Because there is typically
   no caching in the stub resolver, the recursive resolver, unlike the
   authoritative servers, sees all the DNS traffic.  (Applications, like
   web browsers, may have some form of caching that does not follow DNS
   rules, for instance, because it may ignore the TTL.  So, the
   recursive resolver does not see all the name resolution activity.)
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">It should be noted that DNS recursive resolvers sometimes forward
   requests to other recursive resolvers, typically bigger machines,
   with a larger and more shared cache (and the query hierarchy can be
   even deeper, with more than two levels of recursive resolvers).  From
   the point of view of privacy, these forwarders are like resolvers
   except that they do not see all of the requests being made (due to
   caching in the first resolver).

   issues of DNS is the fact that DNS requests received by a server are
   triggered for different reasons.  Let's assume an eavesdropper wants
   to know which web page is viewed by a user.  For a typical web page,
   there are three sorts of DNS requests being issued:
</t>
      <dl newline="true" indent="3" spacing="normal" pn="section-1-9">
        <dt pn="section-1-9.1">Primary request:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-1-9.2"> This is the domain name in the URL that the user
typed, selected from a bookmark, or chose by clicking on a
hyperlink.  Presumably, this is what is of interest for the
eavesdropper.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-1-9.3">Secondary requests:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-1-9.4">These are the additional requests performed by
the user agent (here, the web browser) without any direct
involvement or knowledge of the user.  For the Web, they are
triggered by embedded content, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
JavaScript code, embedded images, etc.  In some cases, there can
be dozens of domain names in different contexts on a single web
page.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-1-9.5">Tertiary requests:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-1-9.6"> These are the additional requests performed by
the DNS service itself.  For instance, if the answer to a query is
a referral to a set of name servers and the glue records are not
returned, the resolver will have to send additional requests to turn
the name servers' names into IP addresses.  Similarly, even if
glue records are returned, a careful recursive server will send
tertiary requests to verify the IP addresses of those records.</dd>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-10">It can also be noted that, in the case of a typical web browser, more
   DNS requests than strictly necessary are sent, for instance, to
   prefetch resources that the user may query later or when
   autocompleting the URL in the address bar.  Both are a significant privacy
   concern since they may leak information even about non-explicit
   actions.  For instance, just reading a local HTML page, even without
   selecting the hyperlinks, may trigger DNS requests.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-1">It has been stated that "the data in the DNS is public".  This sentence
   makes sense for an Internet-wide lookup system,  and there
   are multiple facets to the data and metadata involved that deserve a
   more detailed look.  First, access control lists (ACLs) and private
   namespaces notwithstanding, the DNS operates under the assumption
   that public-facing authoritative name servers will respond to "usual"
   DNS queries for any zone they are authoritative for, without further
   authentication or authorization of the client (resolver).  Due to the
   lack of search capabilities, only a given QNAME will reveal the
   resource records associated with that name (or that name's nonexistence).  In other words: one needs to know what to ask for in
   order to receive a response. There are many ways in which supposedly "private"
   resources currently leak. A few examples are DNSSEC NSEC zone walking <xref target="RFC4470" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4470"/>,
   passive DNS services <xref target="passive-dns" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="passive-dns"/>, etc. The zone transfer QTYPE <xref target="RFC5936" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5936"/> is
   often blocked or restricted to authenticated/authorized access to
   enforce this difference (and maybe for other reasons).
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">Another difference between the DNS data and a particular DNS
  transaction (i.e., a DNS name lookup): DNS data and the results of a
  DNS query are public, within the boundaries described above, and may
  not have any confidentiality requirements.  However, the same is not
  true of a single transaction or a sequence of transactions; those
  transactions are not / should not be public.  A single transaction
  reveals both the originator of the query and the query contents; this
  potentially leaks sensitive information about a specific user. A
   typical example from outside the DNS world is that the website of Alcoholics Anonymous is public but the fact that you visit it should not be. Furthermore,
   the ability to link queries reveals information about individual use
   patterns.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-1">The DNS request includes many fields, but two of them seem particularly
   relevant for the privacy issues: the QNAME and the source IP address.
   "Source IP address" is used in a loose sense of "source IP address + maybe
   source
   port number", because the port number is also in the request and can be used to
   differentiate between several users sharing an IP address (behind a
   Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN), for instance <xref target="RFC6269" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6269"/>).
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-2">The QNAME is the full name sent by the user.  It gives information
   about what the user does ("What are the MX records of example.net?"
   means they probably want to send email to someone at example.net,
   which may be a domain used by only a few persons and is therefore
   very revealing about communication relationships).  Some QNAMEs are
   more sensitive than others.  For instance, querying the A record of a
   well-known web statistics domain reveals very little (everybody
   visits websites that use this analytics service), but querying the A
   record of www.verybad.example where verybad.example is the domain of
   an organization that some people find offensive or objectionable may
   create more problems for the user.  Also, sometimes, the QNAME embeds
   the software one uses, which could be a privacy issue (for instance,
   _ldap._tcp.Default-First-Site-Name._sites.gc._msdcs.example.org.
   There are also some BitTorrent clients that query an SRV record for
   _bittorrent-tracker._tcp.domain.example.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-3">Another important thing about the privacy of the QNAME is future
   usages.  Today, the lack of privacy is an obstacle to putting
   potentially sensitive or personally identifiable data in the DNS.  At
   the moment, your DNS traffic might reveal that you are exchanging emails but not with whom.  If your Mail User Agent (MUA) starts looking up
   Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) keys in the DNS <xref target="RFC7929" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7929"/>, then
   privacy becomes a lot more important.  And email is just an example;
   there would be other really interesting uses for a more privacy-friendly DNS.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-4">For the communication between the stub resolver and the recursive resolver,
   the source IP address is the address of the user's machine. Therefore, all
   the issues and warnings about collection of IP addresses apply here. For the communication between the recursive resolver and the authoritative name
   servers, the source IP address has a different meaning; it does not have the
   same status as the source address in an HTTP connection. It is typically the
   IP address of the recursive resolver that, in a way, "hides" the real user.

   However, hiding does not always work. The edns-client-subnet (ECS) EDNS0 option <xref target="RFC7871" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7871"/> is sometimes used (see one privacy analysis in <xref target="denis-edns-client-subnet" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="denis-edns-client-subnet"/>).

   Sometimes the end user has a personal recursive resolver on their machine.
   In both cases, the IP address originating queries to the authoritative server
   is as sensitive as it is for HTTP <xref target="sidn-entrada" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="sidn-entrada"/>.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-5">A note about IP addresses: there is currently no IETF document that describes
   in detail all the privacy issues around IP addressing in general, although
   <xref target="RFC7721" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7721"/> does discuss privacy considerations for IPv6 address generation
   mechanisms. In the meantime, the discussion here is intended to include both
   IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses. For a number of reasons, their assignment and
   utilization characteristics are different, which may have implications for
   details of information leakage associated with the collection of source
   addresses. (For example, a specific IPv6 source address seen on the public
   Internet is less likely than an IPv4 address to originate behind an address-sharing scheme.) However, for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, it is
   important to note that source addresses are propagated with queries
via the ECS option and comprise metadata about the host, user,
or application that originated them.

          <li pn="section-5.1-5.1">The recursive resolver can be on the end user's device.  In (currently) a small number of cases, individuals may choose to
operate their own DNS resolver on their local machine.  In this

machine. The recursive resolver will expose data to authoritative

Note that in large enterprise networks, the DNS resolver may not
be located at the edge of the local network but rather at the edge
of the overall enterprise network.  In this case, the enterprise
network could be thought of as similar to the Internet Access
Provider (IAP) network referenced below.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.1-5.3">The recursive resolver can be in the IAP network. For most residential
networks and potentially other networks, the typical case is for the
user's device to be configured (typically automatically through DHCP or
relay agent options) with the addresses of the DNS proxy in the Customer
Premises Equipment (CPE), which in turn
points to the DNS recursive resolvers at the IAP. The attack surface for

  direct privacy considerations for end users. Historically, end user devices
  have used the DHCP-provided local network recursive resolver. The choice by a
  user to join a particular network (e.g., by physically plugging in a cable or
  selecting a network in an OS dialogue) typically updates a number of system
  resources -- these can include IP addresses, the availability of IPv4/IPv6, DHCP
  server, and DNS resolver. These individual changes, including the change in
  DNS resolver, are not normally communicated directly to the user by the OS
  when the network is joined. The choice of network has historically determined
  the default system DNS resolver selection; the two are directly coupled in
  this model.
</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1.1-2">The vast majority of users do not change their default system DNS settings
  and so implicitly accept the network settings for the DNS. The network resolvers

  queries from a device. These resolvers may have varied
  privacy policies depending on the network. Privacy policies for these servers
  may or may not be available, and users need to be aware that privacy
  guarantees will vary with the network.

using no identifiable HTTP headers, and there might be others that provide feature-rich data flows where the low-level origin of the DNS query is easily
identifiable. Some implementations have, in fact, chosen to restrict the use of the User-Agent header so that resolver operators cannot identify the specific
application that is originating the DNS queries.

   authoritative name servers are limited by caching; they see only the requests

   observer from seeing everything. Similarly, the increasing deployment of QNAME
   minimization <xref target="ripe-qname-measurements" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ripe-qname-measurements"/> reduces the data visible at the

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">   This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish
   information about themselves, such as whether they perform DNSSEC
   validation or are available over transports other than what is
   defined in RFC 1035.  The information is returned as a JSON object.
   The names in this object are defined in an IANA registry that allows
   for light-weight registration.  Applications and operating systems
   can use the methods defined here to get the information from
   resolvers in order to make choices about how to send future queries
   to those resolvers.

   There is a GitHub repo for this draft where pull requests can be
   issued: https://github.com/DNSOP/draft-ietf-dnsop-resolver-
   information However, starting issues on the WG mailing list is
   preferred.

              <t indent="0">   This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy
   for DNS.  The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to
   that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-
   line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient
   error corrections than UDP.  DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy
   properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC7858, and
   latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.

              <t indent="0">The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber.  Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing.  These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches.  Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on.  Solution-specific discussions are out of scope.</t>
              <t indent="0">Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise to the issues identified herein.

              <t indent="0">This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO).  TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.</t>

Over the last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation.  This document provides recommendations for improving the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.</t>

              <t indent="0">The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking" and "filtering", the active prevention of such communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches.</t>
