VPLS is expected to\r\ndeliver the same level of service that current enterprise users are accustomed\r\nto from their own enterprise bridged networks or their Ethernet\r\nService Providers.\r\n\r\nWhen customer edge (CE) devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain\r\nissues and challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network.  The\r\nmajority of these issues have been addressed in the IEEE 802.1ad\r\nstandard for provider bridges and they can be leveraged for VPLS\r\nnetworks.  This document extends the provider edge (PE) model described in\r\nRFC 4664 based on IEEE 802.1ad bridge module, and it illustrates a clear\r\ndemarcation between the IEEE bridge module and IETF LAN emulation\r\nmodule.  By doing so, it shows that the majority of interoperability\r\nissues with CE bridges can be delegated to the 802.1ad bridge\r\nmodule, thus removing the burden on the IETF LAN emulation module\r\nwithin a VPLS PE.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["ieee bridges"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6246","errata_url":null}
