This document specifies\r\nextensions to the RBridge Channel protocol header to support two\r\nfeatures as follows: (1) a standard method to tunnel payloads whose\r\ntype can be indicated by Ethertype through encapsulation in RBridge\r\nChannel messages; and (2) a method to support security facilities for\r\nRBridge Channel messages.
