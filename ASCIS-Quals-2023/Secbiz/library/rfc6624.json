In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome.  This document\r\npresents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services\r\nwhere the L2VPN customer's experience is virtually identical to that\r\noffered by traditional L2VPNs, but such that a Service Provider can\r\nmaintain a single network for L2VPNs, IP VPNs, and the Internet, as\r\nwell as a common provisioning methodology for all services.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["BGP","L2VPN","discovery","signaling","pseudowire"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6624","errata_url":null}
