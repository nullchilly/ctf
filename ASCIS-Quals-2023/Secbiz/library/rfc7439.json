This document is\r\nintended to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS suite,\r\nand is not intended to highlight particular vendor implementations\r\n(or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS labeled packets\r\ncan be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations.\r\nHowever, support for IPv6 among MPLS control-plane protocols, MPLS\r\napplications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM),\r\nand MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps.  For\r\nmost major gaps, work is in progress to upgrade the relevant\r\nprotocols.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":["MPLS","LDP","IPv6","RSVP","L3VPN","L2VPN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7439","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7439"}
