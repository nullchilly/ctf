RFC 6724\r\nallows for the future definition of methods to administratively\r\nconfigure the address selection policy information.  This document\r\ndefines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site\r\nadministrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the\r\ndefault address selection parameters and policy table, and thus\r\nallowing the administrator to control the address selection behavior\r\nof nodes in their site.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7078","errata_url":null}
