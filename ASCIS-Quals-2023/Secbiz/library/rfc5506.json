The size can be reduced if the rules on how to create\r\ncompound packets outlined in RFC 3550 are removed or changed.  Based\r\non that analysis, this memo defines certain changes to the rules to\r\nallow feedback messages to be sent as Reduced-Size RTCP packets under\r\ncertain conditions when using the RTP\/AVPF (Real-time Transport\r\nProtocol \/ Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback) profile (RFC 4585).\r\nThis document updates RFC 3550, RFC 3711, and RFC 4585.
