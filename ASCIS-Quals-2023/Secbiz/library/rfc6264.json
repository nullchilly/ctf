As IPv4\r\naddress exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become\r\nmore critical and less tractable.  Host-based transition mechanisms\r\nused in dual-stack environments cannot meet all transition\r\nrequirements.  Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure\r\nor maintain host-based transition mechanisms.  Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)\r\ndevices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the\r\noperational changes required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or\r\ncoexistence period.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6\r\ntransition.  It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6 hosts and\r\nIPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy\r\nISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6\r\nmigration.  Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and\r\nencourages smooth transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP\r\nnetworks.  An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive home\r\ngateway (HG) device are described.  Both are reusable during\r\ndifferent transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades.  This enables\r\nIPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to real user\r\nrequirements.
