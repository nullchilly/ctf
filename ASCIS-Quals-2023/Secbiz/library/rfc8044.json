During this time, RADIUS\r\nimplementations have named the data types and have used them in\r\nattribute definitions.  This document updates the specifications to\r\nbetter follow established practice.  We do this by naming the data\r\ntypes defined in RFC 6158, which have been used since at least the\r\npublication of RFC 2865.  We provide an IANA registry for the data\r\ntypes and update the \"RADIUS Attribute Types\" registry to include a\r\nData Type field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that\r\nauthors of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to\r\nexisting practice.
