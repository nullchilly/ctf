It defines the\r\nsyntax and semantics for an SDP \"source-filter\" attribute that may\r\nreference either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) as either an inclusive or\r\nexclusive source list for either multicast or unicast destinations.\r\nIn particular, an inclusive source-filter can be used to specify a\r\nSource-Specific Multicast (SSM) session.
