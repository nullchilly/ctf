It defines a set of new\r\nMIB objects to characterise the behaviour and performance of\r\ntransport layer endpoints deploying UDP-Lite.  UDP-Lite resembles\r\nUDP, but differs from the semantics of UDP by the addition of a\r\nsingle option.  This adds the capability for variable-length data\r\nchecksum coverage, which can benefit a class of applications that\r\nprefer delivery of (partially) corrupted datagram payload data in\r\npreference to discarding the datagram.
