A connectivity\r\nprecondition can be used to delay session establishment or\r\nmodification until media stream connectivity has been successfully\r\nverified.  The method of verification may vary depending on the type\r\nof transport used for the media.  For unreliable datagram transports\r\nsuch as UDP, verification involves probing the stream with data or\r\ncontrol packets.  For reliable connection-oriented transports such as\r\nTCP, verification can be achieved simply by successful connection\r\nestablishment or by probing the connection with data or control\r\npackets, depending on the situation.
