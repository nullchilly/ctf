This information can be of\r\nconsiderable size, particularly if the server certificate is bundled\r\nwith a complete certificate chain (i.e., the certificates of\r\nintermediate CAs up to the root CA).\r\n\r\nThis document defines an extension that allows a TLS client to inform\r\na server of cached information, thereby enabling the server to omit\r\nalready available information.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["TLS Cached Information","TLS Cached Info","TLS Extension","TLS Optimization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7924","errata_url":null}
