In mobile or other environments where these\r\ncharacteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the\r\ninference of state through routing or transport protocols does not\r\nallow the router to make the best decisions.  This document\r\nintroduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol\r\n(DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication\r\nchannel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication\r\nof changing link characteristics.","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8175","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8175"}
