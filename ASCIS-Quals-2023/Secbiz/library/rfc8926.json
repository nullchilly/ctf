As a\r\nresult of their role in tying together different elements of the\r\nsystem, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these\r\ncomponents.  Therefore, flexibility is the most important aspect of a\r\ntunneling protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of\r\ntechnology. This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol\r\ndesigned to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and\r\nneeds.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["overlay","tunnel","extensible","variable","metadata","options","endpoint","transit"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8926","errata_url":null}
