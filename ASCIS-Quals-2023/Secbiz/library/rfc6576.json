This is the performance-metric\r\nequivalent of interoperability, required to advance RFCs along the\r\nStandards Track.  Results from different implementations of metric\r\nRFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions\r\nand compared using statistical methods.  The goal is an evaluation of\r\nthe metric RFC itself to determine whether its definitions are clear\r\nand unambiguous to implementors and therefore a candidate for\r\nadvancement on the IETF Standards Track.  This document is an\r\nInternet Best Current Practice.
