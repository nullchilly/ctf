This can increase both performance and parallelism,\r\nbut it requires additional client functionality, some of which depends\r\nupon the type of storage used.  The pNFS specification for block\r\nstorage (RFC 5663) describes how clients can identify the volumes\r\nused for pNFS, but this mechanism requires communication with the\r\nNFSv4 server.  This document updates RFC 5663 to add a mechanism that\r\nenables identification of block storage devices used by pNFS file\r\nsystems without communicating with the server.  This enables clients\r\nto control access to pNFS block devices when the client initially\r\nboots, as opposed to waiting until the client can communicate with\r\nthe NFSv4 server.
