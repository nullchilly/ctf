The purpose\r\nof publication being to facilitate interoperable implementations that\r\nwish to support the GOST algorithms.  This document does not imply\r\nIETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used here.","pub_date":"December 2022","keywords":["password-based cryptography","derived key","GOST algorithms","pkcs5","gost"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9337","errata_url":null}
