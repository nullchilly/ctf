When a PCE has stateful\r\ncontrol over LSPs, it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify\r\nthe attributes (especially the paths) of the LSPs. A Path Computation\r\nClient (PCC) that has set up LSPs under local configuration may\r\ndelegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE.\r\n\r\nThere are use cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain\r\ncontrol of locally configured LSPs that it is aware of but have not\r\nbeen delegated to the PCE.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an extension to the Path Computation Element\r\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make requests for\r\nsuch control.","pub_date":"March 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8741","errata_url":null}
