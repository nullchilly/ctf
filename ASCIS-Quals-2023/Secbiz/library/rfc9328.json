VVC\r\nwas developed by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET). The RTP payload\r\nformat allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction\r\nLayer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as\r\nfragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload\r\nformat has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video\r\nstreaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other\r\napplications.","pub_date":"December 2022","keywords":["H.266","ISO\/IEC 23090-3","MPEG-I Part 3","RTP Payload","Video"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9328","errata_url":null}
