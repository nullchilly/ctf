These algorithms determine the\r\namount of data sent by TCP during loss recovery.  PRR minimizes\r\nexcess window adjustments, and the actual window size at the end of\r\nrecovery will be as close as possible to the ssthresh, as determined\r\nby the congestion control algorithm.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":["TCP loss recovery","packet conservation","self clock"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6937","errata_url":null}
