This document also describes the changes needed\r\nto support the H-bit in the domain.  In addition, this document\r\nupdates RFC 6987 to advertise Type 2 External and Not-So-Stubby Area\r\n(NSSA) Link State Advertisements (LSAs) (RFC 3101) with a high cost\r\nin order to repel traffic effectively.","pub_date":"April 2020","keywords":["non-transit"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6987"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8770","errata_url":null}
