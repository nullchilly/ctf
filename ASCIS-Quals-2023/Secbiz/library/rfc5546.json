This is done without reference to a\r\nspecific transport protocol so as to allow multiple methods of\r\ncommunication between systems.  Subsequent documents will define\r\nprofiles of this protocol that use specific, interoperable methods of\r\ncommunication between systems.\r\n\r\nThe iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)\r\ncomplements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics\r\nfor group scheduling methods commonly available in current\r\ncalendaring systems.  These scheduling methods permit two or more\r\ncalendaring systems to perform transactions such as publishing,\r\nscheduling, rescheduling, responding to scheduling requests,\r\nnegotiating changes, or canceling.
