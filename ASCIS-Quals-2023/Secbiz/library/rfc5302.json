The IS-IS protocol is specified in ISO\r\n10589, with extensions for supporting IPv4 (Internet Protocol)\r\nspecified in RFC 1195.  This document replaces RFC 2966.\r\n\r\nThis document extends the semantics presented in RFC 1195 so that a\r\nrouting domain running with both level 1 and level 2 Intermediate\r\nSystems (IS) (routers) can distribute IP prefixes between level 1 and\r\nlevel 2, and vice versa.  This distribution requires certain\r\nrestrictions to ensure that persistent forwarding loops do not form.\r\nThe goal of this domain-wide prefix distribution is to increase the\r\ngranularity of the routing information within the domain.
