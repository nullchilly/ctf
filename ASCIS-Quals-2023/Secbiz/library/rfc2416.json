Partridge"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"7","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"TCP Implementation","abstract":" This memo is to document a simple experiment.  The experiment showed that in the case of a TCP receiver behind a 9600 bps modem link at the edge of a fast Internet where there are only 3 buffers before the modem (and the fourth packet of a four-packet start will surely be dropped), no significant degradation in performance is experienced by a TCP sending with a four-packet start when compared with a normal slow start (which starts with just one packet).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
