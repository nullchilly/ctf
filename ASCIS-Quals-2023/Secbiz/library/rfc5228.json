It is designed to be implementable on either\r\na mail client or mail server.  It is meant to be extensible, simple,\r\nand independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating\r\nsystem.  It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may\r\nnot be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box\r\nInternet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base language\r\nhas no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external\r\nprograms.
