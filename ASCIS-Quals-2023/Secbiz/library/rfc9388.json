RFC 8006 defines footprint types\r\nthat are used for footprint objects as part of the Metadata interface\r\n(MI). The footprint types are also used for the Footprint &\r\nCapabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) as defined in RFC 8008.\r\nThis document defines two new footprint types. The first footprint\r\ntype defined is an ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code. Defining this\r\ncountry subdivision code improves granularity for delegation as\r\ncompared to the ISO 3166-1 country code footprint type defined in RFC\r\n8006.  The ISO 3166-2 country subdivision code is also added as a new\r\nentity domain type in the \"ALTO Entity Domain Types\" registry defined\r\nin Section 7.4 of RFC 9241. The second footprint type defines a\r\nfootprint union to aggregate footprint objects. This allows for\r\nadditive semantics over the narrowing semantics defined in Appendix B\r\nof RFC 8008 and therefore updates RFC 8008. The two new footprint\r\ntypes are based on the requirements raised by Open Caching but are\r\nalso applicable to CDNI use cases in general.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":["Request Routing","Footprint and Capabilities Semantics"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8008"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9388","errata_url":null}
