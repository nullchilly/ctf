The\r\nmodification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport to restart its\r\nretransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that the\r\neffective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in\r\nsituations where fast retransmit cannot be used.  This enables faster\r\nloss detection and recovery for connections that are short lived or\r\napplication limited.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["tcp","retransmission timer","rtor"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7765","errata_url":null}
