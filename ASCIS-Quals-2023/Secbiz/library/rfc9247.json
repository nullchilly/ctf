The\r\nlink-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF) have been extended to\r\nadvertise the S-BFD Discriminators.\r\n\r\nThis document defines extensions to the BGP - Link State (BGP-LS)\r\naddress family to carry the S-BFD Discriminators' information via\r\nBGP.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["BGP-LS","BFD","IS-IS","OSPF","OSPFv3"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9247","errata_url":null}
