The information\r\ndistributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions can then be used to make\r\npath-selection decisions based on network performance.\r\n\r\nNote that this document only covers the mechanisms with which\r\nnetwork-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for\r\nmeasuring network performance or acting on that information, once\r\ndistributed, are outside the scope of this document.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8570"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7810","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7810"}
