In addition to more substantive\r\nchanges that are described in other documents, the transition to the\r\n2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes several position\r\ntitles and organizational relationships that are referenced\r\nelsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents\r\nindividually, this specification provides updates to them and\r\ndeprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no\r\nconfusion due to these changes.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["IASA","IASA2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2028","RFC2418","RFC3005","RFC3710","RFC3929","RFC4633","RFC6702"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0101"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8717","errata_url":null}
