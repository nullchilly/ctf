TFRC was intended for applications that use a fixed\r\npacket size, and was designed to be reasonably fair when competing\r\nfor bandwidth with TCP connections using the same packet size.  This\r\ndocument proposes TFRC-SP, a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC, that\r\nis designed for applications that send small packets.  The design\r\ngoal for TFRC-SP is to achieve the same bandwidth in bps (bits per\r\nsecond) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes.  TFRC-SP\r\nenforces a minimum interval of 10 ms between data packets to\r\nprevent a single flow from sending small packets arbitrarily\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nFlows using TFRC-SP compete reasonably fairly with large-packet TCP\r\nand TFRC flows in environments where large-packet flows and\r\nsmall-packet flows experience similar packet drop rates.  However, in\r\nenvironments where small-packet flows experience lower packet drop\r\nrates than large-packet flows (e.g., with Drop-Tail queues in units\r\nof bytes), TFRC-SP can receive considerably more than its share of\r\nthe bandwidth.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","transmission control protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4828","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4828"}
