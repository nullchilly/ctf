Some BFD implementations may be\r\nrestricted to only support several interval values.  When such BFD\r\nimplementations speak to each other, there is a possibility of two\r\nsides not being able to find a common value for the interval to run\r\nBFD sessions.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5880 by defining a small set of interval\r\nvalues for BFD that we call \"Common Intervals\" and recommends\r\nimplementations to support the defined intervals.  This solves the\r\nproblem of finding an interval value that both BFD speakers can\r\nsupport while allowing a simplified implementation as seen for\r\nhardware-based BFD.  It does not restrict an implementation from\r\nsupporting more intervals in addition to the Common Intervals.","pub_date":"December 2014","keywords":["BFD","hardware","interval","timer"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5880"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7419","errata_url":null}
