This technology adds an extra Carrier-\r\nGrade NAT (CGN) in the Service Provider network, often resulting in\r\ntwo NATs.  CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications\r\nindependently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet\r\nservices using a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and\r\nvendor equipment.  This document identifies areas where adding a\r\nsecond layer of NAT disrupts the communication channel for common\r\nInternet applications.  This document was updated to include the\r\nDual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) impacts also.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["CGN","NAT444","DS-Lite","Dual-Stack Lite","IPv4","NAT","IPv6","LSN transition"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7021","errata_url":null}
