In Identity-based cryptography, this\r\nadds unnecessary overhead and administration.  The Elliptic Curve-based\r\nCertificateless Signatures for Identity-based Encryption (ECCSI)\r\nsignature scheme described in this document is certificateless.\r\nThis scheme has the additional advantages of low bandwidth and low\r\ncomputational requirements.  This document is not an Internet Standards \r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6507","errata_url":null}
