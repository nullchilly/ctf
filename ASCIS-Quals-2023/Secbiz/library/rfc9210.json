This document requires the\r\noperational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried over\r\nTCP on the Internet as a Best Current Practice.  This operational\r\nrequirement is aligned with the implementation requirements in RFC\r\n7766.  The use of TCP includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP as well\r\nas over an encrypted TLS session.  The document also considers the\r\nconsequences of this form of DNS communication and the potential\r\noperational issues that can arise when this Best Current Practice is\r\nnot upheld.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":["DNS","TCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1123","RFC1536"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0235"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9210","errata_url":null}
