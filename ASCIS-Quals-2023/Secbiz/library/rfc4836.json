In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3\r\nMedium Attachment Units (MAUs).  This document obsoletes RFC 3636.\r\nIt amends that specification by moving MAU type OBJECT-IDENTITY\r\ndefinitions and relevant textual conventions into a separate Internet\r\nAssigned Number Authority (IANA) maintained MIB module.  In addition,\r\nmanagement information is added to enable support for Ethernet in the\r\nFirst Mile (EFM) and 10GBASE-CX4 MAUs.
