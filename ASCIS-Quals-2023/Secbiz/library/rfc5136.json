In addition, the lack of a unified nomenclature on\r\nthis subject makes it increasingly difficult to properly build, test,\r\nand use techniques and tools built around these constructs.  This\r\ndocument provides definitions for the terms 'Capacity' and 'Available\r\nCapacity' related to IP traffic traveling between a source and\r\ndestination in an IP network.  By doing so, we hope to provide a\r\ncommon framework for the discussion and analysis of a diverse set of\r\ncurrent and future estimation techniques.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2008","keywords":["bandwidth","bandwidth estimation","capacity estimation","link capacity","available capacity","narrow link","tight link"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5136","errata_url":null}
