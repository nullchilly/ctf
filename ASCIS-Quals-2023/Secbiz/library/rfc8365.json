In particular, the following\r\nencapsulation options are analyzed: Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN),\r\nNetwork Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation (NVGRE),\r\nand MPLS over GRE.  This specification is also applicable to Generic\r\nNetwork Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE); however, some\r\nincremental work is required, which will be covered in a separate\r\ndocument.  This document also specifies new multihoming procedures\r\nfor split-horizon filtering and mass withdrawal.  It also specifies\r\nEVPN route constructions for VXLAN\/NVGRE encapsulations and\r\nAutonomous System Border Router (ASBR) procedures for multihoming of\r\nNetwork Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices.","pub_date":"March 2018","keywords":["EVPN Control Plane with VxLAN Encapsulation","EVPN Control Plane with NvGRE Encapsulation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8365","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8365"}
