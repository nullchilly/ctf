A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a\r\nclient that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and\r\nSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the\r\nnext.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes\r\nwith one command, limiting the round trips and waiting for various\r\nsearches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently\r\nselected mailbox.  This extension also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in\r\nESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it\r\nchooses.  This document updates RFC 4466.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["[--------]","email","multiple mailboxes","imapext"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7377"],"updates":["RFC4466"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6237","errata_url":null}
