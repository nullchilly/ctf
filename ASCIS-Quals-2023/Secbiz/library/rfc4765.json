An implementation of the data model in the\r\nExtensible Markup Language (XML) is presented, an XML Document Type\r\nDefinition is developed, and examples are provided.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]","intrusion detection","security","secure","exchange","intrusion","IDS","XML"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4765","errata_url":null}
