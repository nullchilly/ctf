RaptorQ is also a fountain\r\ncode, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated on\r\nthe fly by the encoder from the source symbols of a source block of\r\ndata.  The decoder is able to recover the source block from almost\r\nany set of encoding symbols of sufficient cardinality -- in most\r\ncases, a set of cardinality equal to the number of source symbols is\r\nsufficient; in rare cases, a set of cardinality slightly more than\r\nthe number of source symbols is required.\r\n\r\nThe RaptorQ code described here is a systematic code, meaning that\r\nall the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be\r\ngenerated.
