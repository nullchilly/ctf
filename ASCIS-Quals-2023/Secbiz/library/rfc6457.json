It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to\r\nprovide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network\r\nlayers.  PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.\r\n\r\nGeneric requirements for a communication protocol between Path\r\nComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, \"Path\r\nComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic\r\nRequirements\".  Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are\r\npresented in RFC 4674, \"Requirements for Path Computation Element\r\n(PCE) Discovery\".\r\n\r\nThis document complements the generic requirements and presents\r\ndetailed sets of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements and PCE\r\ndiscovery protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"December 2011","keywords":["PCEP","inter-layer","traffic engineering","MPLS","GMPLS","VNT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6457","errata_url":null}
