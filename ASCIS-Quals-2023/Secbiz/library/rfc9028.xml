      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1"> This document specifies a new Network Address Translator (NAT)
      traversal mode for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). The new mode is
      based on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology
      and UDP encapsulation of data and signaling traffic. The main difference
      from the previously specified modes is the use of HIP messages instead
      of ICE for all NAT traversal procedures due to the kernel-space
      dependencies of HIP.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1"> The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/> is specified to run directly on top of IPv4 or
      IPv6. However, many middleboxes found in the Internet, such as NATs and
      firewalls, often allow only UDP or TCP traffic to pass <xref target="RFC5207" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5207"/>. Also, NATs usually require the host
      behind a NAT to create a forwarding state in the NAT before other hosts
      outside of the NAT can contact the host behind the NAT. To overcome this
      problem, different methods, commonly referred to as NAT traversal
      techniques, have been developed. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">As one solution, the HIP experiment report <xref target="RFC6538" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6538"/> mentions Teredo-based NAT traversal for HIP and
      related Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) traffic (with double
      tunneling overhead). Another solution is specified in <xref target="RFC5770" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5770"/>, which will be referred to as
      "Legacy ICE-HIP" in this document. The experimental Legacy ICE-HIP
      specification combines the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
      protocol (originally <xref target="RFC5245" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5245"/>) with HIP so that
      basically, ICE is responsible for NAT traversal and connectivity
      testing, while HIP is responsible for end-host authentication and IPsec
      key management. The resulting protocol uses HIP, Session Traversal
      Utilities for NAT (STUN), and ESP messages tunneled over a single UDP
      flow. The benefit of using ICE and its STUN / Traversal Using Relays
      around NAT (TURN) messaging formats is
      that one can reuse the NAT traversal infrastructure already available
      in the Internet, such as STUN and TURN servers. Also, some middleboxes
      may be STUN aware and may be able to do something "smart" when they see
      STUN being used for NAT traversal.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">HIP poses a unique challenge to using standard ICE, not only due to
      kernel-space dependencies of HIP, but also due to its close integration
      with kernel-space IPsec; and, while <xref target="RFC5770" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5770"/> provides a technically workable path, HIP incurs
      unacceptable performance drawbacks for kernel-space
      implementations. Also, implementing and integrating a full ICE/STUN/TURN
      protocol stack as specified in Legacy ICE-HIP results in a considerable
      amount of effort and code, which could be avoided by reusing and
      extending HIP messages and state machines for the same purpose. Thus,
      this document specifies an alternative NAT traversal mode referred to as
      "Native ICE-HIP" that employs the HIP messaging format instead of STUN
      or TURN for the connectivity checks, keepalives, and data relaying.
      Native ICE-HIP also specifies how mobility management works in the
      context of NAT traversal, which is missing from the Legacy ICE-HIP
      specification. The native specification is also based on HIPv2, whereas
      the legacy specification is based on HIPv1. The differences to Legacy
      ICE-HIP are further elaborated in <xref target="sec_ice_diff" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix B"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">Similar to Legacy ICE-HIP, this specification builds on the HIP
      registration extensions <xref target="RFC8003" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8003"/> and
      the base exchange procedure <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/>
      and its closing procedures; therefore, the reader is recommended to get
      familiar with the relevant specifications. In a nutshell, the
      registration extensions allow a HIP Initiator (usually a "client" host)
      to ask for specific services from a HIP Responder (usually a "server"
      host). The registration parameters are included in a base exchange,
      which is essentially a four-way Diffie-Hellman key exchange
      authenticated using the public keys of the end hosts. When the hosts
      negotiate support for ESP <xref target="RFC7402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7402"/>
      during the base exchange, they can deliver ESP-protected application
      payload to each other.  When either of the hosts moves and changes its
      IP address, the two hosts re-establish connectivity using the mobility
      extensions <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/>. The reader is also
      recommended to get familiar with the mobility extensions; basically,
      the process is a three-way procedure where the mobile host first
      announces its new location to the peer; then, the peer tests
      for connectivity (the so-called return routability check); and then, the
      mobile host must respond to the announcement in order to activate its
      new location. This specification builds on the mobility procedures, but
      modifies them to be compatible with ICE. The differences in the mobility
      extensions are specified in <xref target="sec_hip_diff" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix C"/>. It is worth noting that multihoming support as
      specified in <xref target="RFC8047" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8047"/> is left for
      further study.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">This specification builds heavily on the ICE methodology, so it is
      recommended that the reader is familiar with the ICE specification <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/> (especially the overview). However,
      Native ICE-HIP does not implement all the features in ICE; hence,
      the different features of ICE are cross referenced using <xref target="RFC2119" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2119"/> terminology for clarity. <xref target="sec_ice_diff" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix B"/> explains the differences to
      ICE, and it is recommended that the reader read this section
      in addition to the ICE specification.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2"> In the example configuration depicted in <xref target="fig_overview" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>, both Initiator and Responder are behind one or more
      NATs, and both private networks are connected to the public Internet. To
      be contacted from behind a NAT, at least the Responder must be
      registered with a Control Relay Server reachable on the public
      Internet. The Responder may have also registered to a Data Relay Server
      that can forward the data plane in case NAT traversal fails. While,
      strictly speaking, the Initiator does not need a Data Relay Server, it
      may act in the other role with other hosts; connectivity with the
      Data Relay Server of the Responder may fail, so the Initiator may also
      need to register to a Control and/or Data Relay Server. It is worth
      noting that a Control and Data Relay does not forge the source address
      of a passing packet but always translates the source address and source
      port of a packet to be forwarded (to its own).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">We assume, as a starting point, that the Initiator knows both the
      Responder's Host Identity Tag (HIT) and the address(es) of the
      Responder's Control Relay Server(s) (how the Initiator learns of the
      Responder's Control Relay Server is outside of the scope of this
      document, but it may be learned through DNS or another name service). The first
      steps are for both the Initiator and Responder to register with a
      Control Relay Server (need not be the same one) and gather a set of
      address candidates. The hosts use either Control Relay Servers or Data
      Relay Servers for gathering the candidates. Next, the HIP base exchange
      is carried out by encapsulating the HIP control packets in UDP datagrams
      and sending them through the Responder's Control Relay Server.  As part
      of the base exchange, each HIP host learns of the peer's candidate
      addresses through the HIP offer/answer procedure embedded in the base
      exchange.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4"> Once the base exchange is completed, two HIP hosts have established
      a working communication session (for signaling) via a Control Relay
      Server, but the hosts still have to find a better path, preferably
      without a Data Relay Server, for the ESP data flow. For this,
      connectivity checks are carried out until a working pair of addresses is
      discovered.  At the end of the procedure, if successful, the hosts will
      have established a UDP-based tunnel that traverses both NATs with the
      data flowing directly from NAT to NAT or via a Data Relay Server. At
      this point, the HIP signaling can also be sent over the same
      address/port pair, and is demultiplexed (or, in other words, separated)
      from IPsec as described in the UDP encapsulation standard for IPsec
      <xref target="RFC3948" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3948"/>. Finally, the two hosts send
      NAT keepalives as needed in order keep their UDP-tunnel state active in
      the associated NAT boxes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-5"> If either one of the hosts knows that it is not behind a NAT, hosts
      can negotiate during the base exchange a different mode of NAT traversal
      that does not use HIP connectivity checks, but only UDP encapsulation of
      HIP and ESP. Also, it is possible for the Initiator to simultaneously try
      a base exchange with and without UDP encapsulation. If a base exchange
      without UDP encapsulation succeeds, no HIP connectivity checks or UDP
      encapsulation of ESP are needed. </t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-1"> An Initiator needs to gather a set of address candidates
        before contacting a (non-relay) Responder. The candidates are
        needed for connectivity checks that allow two hosts to
        discover a direct, non-relayed path for communicating with
        each other. One server-reflexive candidate can be discovered
        during the registration with the Control Relay Server from the
        REG_FROM parameter (and another from Data Relay Server if one
        is employed).


        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-2"> The candidate gathering can be done at any time, but it needs to be
        done before sending an I2 or R2 in the base exchange if ICE-HIP-UDP mode is to be
        used for the connectivity checks. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that all three
        types of candidates (host, server reflexive, and relayed) are gathered
        to maximize the probability of successful NAT traversal. However, if no
        Data Relay Server is used, and the host has only a single local IP address to
        use, the host <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the local address as the only host candidate and
        the address from the REG_FROM parameter discovered during the Control Relay Server
        registration as a server-reflexive candidate. In this case, no further
        candidate gathering is needed. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-3">A Data Relay Client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> register only a single
	relayed candidate that it uses with multiple other peers. However, it

	server relayed candidate for each of its peers for the reasons

        parameters: the registration request (REG_REQ) parameter with
        Registration Type CANDIDATE_DISCOVERY (value 4)
        and the ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED parameter.  When a Control Relay Server
        receives an UPDATE message with registration request
        containing a CANDIDATE_DISCOVERY type, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-6">In step 1, the mobile host has changed location and sends a
        location update to its peer through the Control Relay Server of the
        peer. It sends an UPDATE packet with the source HIT belonging to
        itself and destination HIT belonging to the peer host. In the packet,
        the source IP address belongs to the mobile host and the destination
        to the Control Relay Server. The packet contains an ESP_INFO parameter
        where, in this case, the OLD SPI and NEW SPI parameters both contain
        the pre-existing incoming SPI. The packet also contains the locators
        of the mobile host in a LOCATOR_SET parameter, encapsulated inside an
        ENCRYPTED parameter (see Sections <xref target="RFC7401" section="5.2.18" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7401#section-5.2.18" derivedContent="RFC7401"/> and <xref target="RFC7401" section="6.5" sectionFormat="bare" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7401#section-6.5" derivedContent="RFC7401"/> in <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/> for details on the ENCRYPTED parameter). The packet
        also contains a SEQ number to be acknowledged by the peer. As
        specified in <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/>, the packet may
        also include a HOST_ID (for middlebox inspection) and DIFFIE_HELLMAN
        parameter for rekeying.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-7">In step 2, the Control Relay Server receives the UPDATE packet and forwards it
        to the peer host (i.e., Control Relay Client). The Control Relay Server
        rewrites the destination IP address and appends a RELAY_FROM
        parameter to the message.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-8">In step 3, the peer host receives the UPDATE packet,
        processes it, and responds with another UPDATE message. The
        message is destined to the HIT of the mobile host and to the IP
        address of the Control Relay Server. The message includes an ESP_INFO
        parameter where, in this case, the OLD SPI and NEW SPI
        parameters both contain the pre-existing incoming SPI. The
        peer includes a new SEQ and ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED parameter to be
        acknowledged by the mobile host.  The message acknowledges the
        SEQ parameter of the earlier message with an ACK parameter.
        The RELAY_TO parameter specifies the address of the mobile host where the
        Control Relay Server should forward the message.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-9">In step 4, the Control Relay Server receives the message, rewrites the
        destination IP address and UDP port according to the RELAY_TO parameter, and
        then forwards the modified message to the mobile host.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-10">In step 5, the mobile host receives the UPDATE packet and processes
        it. The mobile host concludes the handover procedure by acknowledging
        the received SEQ parameter with an ACK parameter and the
        ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED parameter with an ECHO_RESPONSE_SIGNED
        parameter. The mobile host sends the packet to the HIT of the peer and
        to the address of the HIP relay. The mobile host can start
        connectivity checks after this packet. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-11">In step 6, the HIP relay receives the UPDATE packet and
        forwards it to the peer host (i.e., Relay Client). The HIP
        relay rewrites the destination IP address and port, and then appends a
        RELAY_FROM parameter to the message. When the peer host
        receives this concluding UPDATE packet, it can initiate the
        connectivity checks.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-12">In step 7, the two hosts test for connectivity across NATs
        according to procedures described in <xref target="sec_conn_checks" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.6"/>. The original Initiator of the 
        communications is the controlling host and the original Responder is
        the controlled host.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-13">In step 8, the connectivity checks are successfully
        completed and the controlling host has nominated one address
        pair to be used. The hosts set up security associations to
        deliver the application payload.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-14">It is worth noting that the Control and Data Relay Client
        do not have to reregister for the related services after a
        handover. However, if a Data Relay Client has registered a
        relayed address candidate from a Data Relay Server, the Data
        Relay Client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reactivate the address before the
        connectivity checks by sending an UPDATE message containing
        the PEER_PERMISSION parameter as described in <xref target="sec_forwarding" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.12.1"/>. Otherwise, the Data Relay
	Server 
        drops ESP packets sent to the relayed address.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-15">In the so-called "double jump" or simultaneous mobility
	scenario, both peers change their location simultaneously. In
	such a case, both peers trigger the procedure described
	earlier in this section at the same time. In other words, both
	of the communicating hosts send an UPDATE packet carrying
	locators at the same time or with some delay. When the
	locators are exchanged almost simultaneously (reliably via
	Control Relay Servers), the two hosts can continue with
	connectivity checks after both have completed separately the
	steps in <xref target="fig_update" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>. The problematic case
	occurs when one of the hosts (referred to here as host "M")
	moves later during the connectivity checks.  In such a case,
	host M sends a locator to the peer, which is in the middle of
	connectivity checks. Upon receiving the UPDATE message, the
	peer responds with an UPDATE with ECHO_REQ_SIGN as described
	in step 3 in <xref target="fig_update" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>. Upon receiving the
	valid response from host M as described in step 6, the peer
	host <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> restart the connectivity checks with host M. This
	way, both hosts start the connectivity checks roughly in a
	synchronized way. It is also important that the peer host does not
	restart the connectivity checks until step 6 is
	successfully completed, because the UPDATE message
	carrying locators in step 1 could be replayed by an attacker.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.12.3-1">From the viewpoint of a host, its remote peers can have
          overlapping inbound SPI numbers because the IPsec also uses the

          Data Relay Server can represent multiple remote peers, thus

          acting now as Responders (as recommended in <xref target="sec_reuse" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.5"/>). When the third host sends an ESP packet, 
          the Data Relay Server is able to forward the packet to the
          correct Data Relay Client because the destination UDP port
          is different for each of the clients.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.12.3-3">In the second scenario, an SPI collision may occur when
	  two Initiators run a base exchange to the same Responder
	  (i.e., Data Relay Client), and both of the Initiators claim
	  the same inbound SPI at the Data Relay Server using
	  the PEER_PERMISSION parameter. In this case, the Data Relay
	  Server cannot disambiguate the correct destination of an ESP
	  packet originating from the Data Relay Client because the
	  SPI could belong to either of the peers (and the destination IP
	  and UDP port belonging to the Data Relay Server are not
	  unique either). The recommended way and a contingency plan
	  to solve this issue are described below.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.12.3-4">The recommend way to mitigate the problem is as follows. For each
          new HIP association, a Data Relay Client acting as a Responder
          <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> register a new server-reflexive candidate as
          described in <xref target="sec_gathering" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2"/>. Similarly, the Data Relay Server <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> reuse the port numbers as described in <xref target="sec_reuse" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.5"/>. This way, each
          server-reflexive candidate for the Data Relay Client has a separate
          UDP port that the Data Relay Server can use to disambiguate packet
          destinations in case of SPI collisions.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.12.3-5">When the Data Relay Client is not registering or failed
	  to register a new relay candidate for a new peer, the Data
	  Relay Client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> follow a contingency plan as follows.
	  Upon receiving an I2 with a colliding SPI, the Data Relay
	  Client acting as the Responder <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include the relayed
	  address candidate in the R2 message because the Data Relay
	  Server would not be able to demultiplex the related ESP packet
	  to the correct Initiator.  The same also applies to the
	  handover procedures; the Data Relay Client <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> include
	  the relayed address candidate when sending its new locator
	  set in an UPDATE to its peer if it would cause an SPI
	  conflict with another peer.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-1"> It is also possible that end users may not want to reveal all
        locators to each other. For example, tracking the physical location of
        a multihoming end host may become easier if it reveals all locators to
        its peer during a base exchange. Also, revealing host addresses exposes
        information about the local topology that may not be allowed in all
        corporate environments.
	For these two local policy reasons, it might be tempting to exclude
        certain host addresses from the LOCATOR_SET parameter of an end host, but
	this is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.

	For instance, such
        behavior creates non-optimal paths when the hosts are located behind
        the same NAT. Especially, this could be problematic with a legacy NAT
        that does not support routing from the private address realm back to
        itself through the outer address of the NAT. This scenario is referred
        to as the hairpin problem <xref target="RFC5128" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5128"/>. With such a legacy
        NAT, the only option left would be to use a relayed transport address
        from a Data Relay Server.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-2"> The use of Control and Data Relay Servers can also be useful for
        privacy purposes. For example, a privacy-concerned Responder may reveal
        only its Control Relay Server and Relayed candidates to Initiators. This
        partially protects the Responder against Denial-of-Service (DoS)
        attacks by allowing the Responder to initiate new connections even if
        its relays would be unavailable due to a DoS attack. </t>

        without setting the destination HIT of the Responder (i.e., the
        Control Relay Client). A Control Relay Server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
        have a unique IP address per the Control Relay Client when the Control
        Relay Server is serving more than one Control Relay Client and
        supports opportunistic mode. Otherwise, the Control Relay Server
        cannot guarantee to deliver the I1 packet to the intended recipient.
        Future extensions of this document may allow opportunistic mode to be
        used with non-unique IP addresses to be utilized either as a HIP-level
        anycast or multicast mechanism. Both of the mentioned cases would

        and Hashed Message Authentication codes, meaning that the mentioned
        security concerns do not apply to HIP either. The mentioned section
        also discusses man-in-the-middle replay attacks that are difficult to
        prevent. The connectivity checks in this protocol are effectively
        immune against replay attacks because a connectivity request includes

        Control Relay Client registers for the RELAY_UDP_HIP service from a
        Control Relay Server. However, the same server may also offer
        Rendezvous functionality; thus, a client can register both to a
        RELAY_UDP_HIP and a RENDEZVOUS (see <xref target="RFC8004" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8004"/>) service from the same server. Potentially, this
        introduces a cross-protocol attack (or actually a "cross-message"
        attack) because the key material is the same for the Control Relay
        Service and Rendezvous HMACs. While the problem could be avoided by
        deriving different keys for the Control Relay Service, a more simple
        measure was chosen because the exact attack scenario was
        unclear. Consequently, this section defines a mandatory mitigation

              <t indent="0">Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet "lost". Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation.</t>

In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.  The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet hosts communicate.  One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet, i.e., its routers.  In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.  These "middleboxes" are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts.  Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.  This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address translators and firewalls.  It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes.  This document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group.

              <t indent="0">If a host is located behind a NAT, it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) in certain situations. In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol, called "Traversal Using Relays around NAT" (TURN), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay. TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address.</t>

              <t indent="0">Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) sends an initialization vector (IV) in each packet. The size of the IV depends on the applied transform and is usually 8 or 16 octets for the transforms defined at the time this document was written. When used with IPsec, some algorithms, such as AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305, take the IV to generate a nonce that is used as an input parameter for encrypting and decrypting. This IV must be unique but can be predictable.  As a result, the value provided in the ESP Sequence Number (SN) can be used instead to generate the nonce. This avoids sending the IV itself and saves 8 octets per packet in the case of AES-GCM, AES-CCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305. This document describes how to do this.</t>

This is a robust method for Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) for datagram Packetization Layers (PLs). It allows a PL, or a datagram application that uses a PL, to discover whether a network path can support the current size of datagram.  This can be used to detect and reduce the message size when a sender encounters a packet black hole. It can also probe a network path to discover whether the maximum packet size can be increased.  This provides functionality for datagram transports that is equivalent to the PLPMTUD specification for TCP, specified in RFC 4821, which it updates. It also updates the UDP Usage Guidelines to refer to this method for use with UDP datagrams and updates SCTP.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-1">Legacy ICE-HIP reuses the ICE/STUN/TURN protocol stack as it is. The
      benefits of such as an approach include the reuse of STUN/TURN
      infrastructure and possibly the reuse of existing software libraries,
      but there are also drawbacks with the approach. For example, ICE is
      meant for application-layer protocols, whereas HIP operates at layer 3.5
      between transport and network layers. This is particularly problematic
      because the implementations employ kernel-space IPsec ESP as their data
      plane: demultiplexing of incoming ESP, HIP, and TURN messages required
      the capturing of all UDP packets destined to port 10500 to the userspace
      (due to different, incompatible markers in ESP and STUN), thus causing
      additional software complexity and an unnecessary latency/throughput
      bottleneck for the dataplane performance. It is also worth noting that
      the demultiplexing of STUN packets in the kernel would also incur a
      performance impact (albeit smaller than with userspace demultiplexing),
      and secure verification of STUN messages would require communication
      between the kernel-space STUN detector and HIP daemon typically residing
      in the userspace (thus again increasing the performance overhead).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-2">Legacy ICE-HIP also involves some other complexities when compared to
      the approach taken in this document.  The relaying of ESP packets via
      TURN relays was not considered that simple because TURN relays require
      adding and removing extra TURN framing for the relayed packets. Finally,
      the developers of the two Legacy ICE-HIP implementations concluded that
           
effort needed for integrating an ICE library into a HIP implementation turned
out to be quite a bit higher than initially estimated. Also, the amount of
extra code (some 10 kLoC) needed for all the new parsers, state machines,
etc., was quite high and by reusing the HIP code, one should be able to do
with much less. This should result in smaller binary size, less bugs, and
easier debugging.

      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-3"> Consequently, the HIP working group decided to follow ICE
       methodology but reuse HIP messaging format to achieve the same
       functionality as ICE; the result of that is this document, which
       specifies the Native ICE-HIP protocol.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-4">The Native ICE-HIP protocol specified in this document follows the semantics
      of ICE as close as possible, and most of the differences are
      syntactical due to the use of a different protocol. In this
      section, we describe the differences to the ICE protocol.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-appendix.b-5">
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.1">ICE operates at the application layer, whereas this
	protocol operates between transport and network layers, thus
	hiding the protocol details from the application.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.2">The STUN protocol is not employed. Instead, Native ICE-HIP
	reuses the HIP control plane format in order to simplify
	the demultiplexing of different protocols. For example, the STUN
	binding response is replaced with a HIP UPDATE message
	containing an ECHO_REQUEST_SIGNED parameter and the STUN
	binding response with a HIP UPDATE message containing an
	ECHO_RESPONSE_SIGNED parameter as defined in <xref target="sec_conn_checks" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.6"/>.  It is worth noting that
	a 
	drawback of not employing STUN is that discovery of the address
	candidates requires creating (using HIP base exchange) and
	maintaining (using HIP UPDATE procedures) state at the Control Relay Client and
	Control Relay Server. Future extensions to this document may define
	a stateless, HIP-specific mechanism for an end host to discover its address candidates.
	</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.3">The TURN protocol is not utilized. Instead, Native ICE-HIP reuses
	Control Relay Servers for the same purpose.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.4">ICMP errors may be used in ICE to signal failure. In the Native ICE-HIP
	protocol, HIP NOTIFY messages are used instead.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.5">Instead of the ICE username fragment and password mechanism for
        credentials, Native ICE-HIP uses the HIT, derived from a public key,
        for the same purpose. The username fragments are "transient host
        identifiers, bound to a particular session established as part of the
        candidate exchange" <xref target="RFC8445" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8445"/>. Generally in HIP, a local public key and the
        derived HIT are considered long-term identifiers and invariant across
        different host associations and different transport-layer flows.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.6">In ICE, the conflict when two communicating endpoints take the
        same controlling role is solved using random values (a so-called
        tie-breaker value). In the Native ICE-HIP protocol, the conflict is solved
        by the standard HIP base exchange procedure, where the host with the
        "larger" HIT switches to the Responder role, thus also changing to
        the controlled role.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.7">The ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes are not
	included in the connectivity checks.

        </li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.8">The foundation concept is unnecessary in Native ICE-HIP
	because only a single UDP flow for the IPsec tunnel will be
	negotiated.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.9">Frozen candidates are omitted for the same reason the

        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.11">Native ICE-HIP supports only "full ICE" where the two
	communicating hosts participate actively to the connectivity checks,
	and the "lite" mode is not supported.  This design decision follows
	the guidelines of ICE, which recommends full ICE implementations.
	However, it should be noted that a publicly reachable Responder may
	refuse to negotiate the ICE mode as described in <xref target="sec_no_relay" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.7.2"/>.  This would result in a HIP
	base exchange (as per <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/>)
	tunneled over UDP, followed by ESP traffic over the same tunnel, without
	the connectivity check procedures defined in this document (in some
	sense, this mode corresponds to the case where two ICE lite
	implementations connect since no connectivity checks are sent).</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.b-5.12">As the "ICE lite" is not adopted here and both sides are
	capable of ICE-HIP-UDP mode (negotiated during the base
	exchange), default candidates are not employed in Native ICE-HIP.</li>

        over UDP. The drawback here is that it works only in the limited cases
        where the Responder has a public address.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.3">It is worth noting that while a Rendezvous Server <xref target="RFC8004" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8004"/> has not been designed to be used
        in NATed scenarios because it just relays the first I1 packet and does
        not employ UDP encapsulation, the Control Relay Server forwards all
        control traffic and, hence, is more suitable in NATed
        environments. Further, the Data Relay Server guarantees forwarding of
        data plane traffic also in cases where the NAT traversal procedures
        fail.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.4">Registration procedures with a Control/Data Relay Server are
        similar as with a Rendezvous Server. However, a Control/Data Relay
        Server has different registration parameters than a Rendezvous Server
        because it offers a different service. Also, the Control/Data Relay
        Server also includes a REG_FROM parameter that informs the
        Control/Data Relay Client about its server-reflexive address. A Data
        Relay Server also includes a RELAYED_ADDRESS containing the relayed
        address for the Data Relay Client.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.5">In <xref target="RFC7401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7401"/>, the Initiator and Responder
	can start to exchange application payload immediately after
	the base exchange. While exchanging data immediately after a
	base exchange via a Data Control Relay would also be possible here, we
	follow the ICE methodology to establish a direct path between
	two hosts using connectivity checks. This means that there
	will be some additional delay after the base exchange before
	application payload can be transmitted. The same applies for
	the UPDATE procedure as the connectivity checks introduce some
	additional delay.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.6">In HIP without any NAT traversal support, the base exchange
	acts as an implicit connectivity check, and the mobility and
	multihoming extensions support explicit connectivity
	checks. After a base exchange or UPDATE-based connectivity
	checks, a host can use the associated address pair for
	transmitting application payload. In this Native ICE-HIP extension, we follow
	the ICE methodology where one endpoint acting in the
	controlled role chooses the used address pair also on behalf
	of the other endpoint acting in the controlled role, which is
	different from HIP without NAT traversal support. Another
	difference is that the process of choosing an address pair is
	explicitly signaled using the nomination packets. The
	nomination process in this protocol supports only a single
	address pair, and multihoming extensions are left for further
	study.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.7">The UPDATE procedure resembles the mobility extensions
	defined in <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/>. The
	first UPDATE message from the mobile host is exactly the same
	as in the mobility extensions. The second UPDATE message from
	the peer host and third from the mobile host are different in
	the sense that they merely acknowledge and conclude the
	reception of the candidates through the Control Relay Server. In other words,
	they do not yet test for connectivity (besides reachability
	through the Control Relay Server) unlike in the mobility extensions. The
	idea is that the connectivity check procedure follows the ICE
	specification, which is somewhat different from the HIP
	mobility extensions.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.8">The connectivity checks as defined in the mobility
	extensions <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/> are
	triggered only by the peer of the mobile host. Since
	successful NAT traversal requires that both endpoints test
	connectivity, both the mobile host and its peer host have to
	test for connectivity. In addition, this protocol
	also validates the UDP ports; the ports in the connectivity
	check must match with the response, as required by ICE.</li>
        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.9">In HIP mobility extensions <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/>, an outbound locator has some associated state:
        UNVERIFIED means that the locator has not been tested for
        reachability, ACTIVE means that the address has been verified for
        reachability and is being used actively, and DEPRECATED means that the
        locator lifetime has expired. In the subset of ICE specifications used
        by this protocol, an individual address candidate has only two
        properties: type and priority. Instead, the actual state in ICE is
        associated with candidate pairs rather than individual addresses. The
        subset of ICE specifications utilized by this protocol require the
        following attributes for a candidate pair: valid bit, nominated bit,
        base, and the state of the connectivity check. The connectivity checks
        have the following states: Waiting, In-progress, Succeeded, and
        Failed. Handling of this state attribute requires some additional
        logic when compared to the mobility extensions, since the state is
        associated with a local-remote address pair rather than just a remote
        address; thus, the mobility and ICE states do not have an unambiguous
        one-to-one mapping.

        <li pn="section-appendix.c-2.10">Credit-based authorization as defined in <xref target="RFC8046" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8046"/> could be used before

	working candidate pairs. However, this may result in the use
	of asymmetric paths for a short time period in the beginning
	of communications. Thus, support of credit-based authorization is left
