To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be\r\nbuilt from the ground up to account for the fundamentally new\r\nproperties of quantum entanglement. The first quantum entanglement\r\nnetworks have been realised, but there is no practical proposal for\r\nhow to organise, utilise, and manage such networks. In this document,\r\nwe attempt to lay down the framework and introduce some basic\r\narchitectural principles for a quantum internet. This is intended for\r\ngeneral guidance and general interest.  It is also intended to\r\nprovide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network\r\nspecialists.
