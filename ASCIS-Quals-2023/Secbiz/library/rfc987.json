It is expected that this standard    will be implemented very widely.  This document describes a set of    mappings which will enable interworking between systems operating the    X.400 protocols and systems using RFC-822 mail protocol or protocols    derived from RFC-822.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements.
