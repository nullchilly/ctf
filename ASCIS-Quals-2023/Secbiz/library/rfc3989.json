The semantics discussion does not include any specification of a concrete syntax or a transport protocol.  However, a concrete protocol is expected to implement the specified semantics or, more likely, a superset of it.  The MIDCOM protocol semantics is derived from the MIDCOM requirements, from the MIDCOM framework, and from working group decisions.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
