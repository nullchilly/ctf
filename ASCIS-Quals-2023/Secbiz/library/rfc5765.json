It has therefore\r\nbecome reasonable for resource consuming and typically centralized\r\napplications like Voice over IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime\r\ncommunication to adapt and exploit the benefits of P2P.  Such a\r\nmigration needs to address a new set of P2P-specific security\r\nproblems.  This document describes some of the known issues found in\r\ncommon P2P networks, analyzing the relevance of such issues and the\r\napplicability of existing solutions when using P2P architectures for\r\nrealtime communication.  This document is a product of the P2P\r\nResearch Group.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["p2p","overlay","rtc","voip"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5765","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5765"}
