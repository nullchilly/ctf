IAX was developed by the open source community for the\r\nAsterisk Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and is targeted primarily at\r\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call control, but it can be used\r\nwith streaming video or any other type of multimedia.\r\n\r\nIAX is an \"all in one\" protocol for handling multimedia in IP\r\nnetworks.  It combines both control and media services in the same\r\nprotocol.  In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static\r\nport greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway\r\ntraversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around\r\nNAT, and simplifying network and firewall management.  IAX employs a\r\ncompact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited\r\nfor Internet telephony service.  In addition, its open nature permits\r\nnew payload type additions needed to support additional services.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["asterisk private branch exchange","pbx","voip","voice over internet protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8996"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5456","errata_url":null}
