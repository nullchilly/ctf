Much has been written on this\r\ntopic over the last 10 to 15 years, but it still remains a problem\r\nwithout a clearly defined or widely implemented solution. Any\r\nmultihoming solution without NAT requires hosts at the site to have\r\naddresses from each ISP and to select the egress ISP by selecting a\r\nsource address for outgoing packets. It also requires routers at the\r\nsite to take into account those source addresses when forwarding\r\npackets out towards the ISPs.\r\n\r\nThis document examines currently available mechanisms for providing a\r\nsolution to this problem for a broad range of enterprise topologies.\r\nIt covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic by taking into\r\naccount source address, and it covers the behavior of hosts to select\r\nappropriate default source addresses. It also covers any possible\r\nrole that routers might play in providing information to hosts to\r\nhelp them select appropriate source addresses. In the process of\r\nexploring potential solutions, this document also makes explicit\r\nrequirements for how the solution would be expected to behave from\r\nthe perspective of an enterprise site network administrator.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8678","errata_url":null}
