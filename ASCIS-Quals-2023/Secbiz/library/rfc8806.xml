      <t pn="section-abstract-1">Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip
      times to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have
      difficulty getting responses from the root servers, such as during a
      network attack. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to prevent
      snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root servers. In both
      cases, resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent
      observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the
      same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver
      software. This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of
      the root zone that does not cause problems for other users of the DNS,
      at the cost of adding some operational fragility for the operator.</t>

      <t pn="section-1-1">DNS recursive resolvers have to provide answers to all queries from
      their clients, even those for domain names that do not exist. For each
      queried name that is within a top-level domain (TLD) that is not in the
      recursive resolver's cache, the resolver must send a query to a root
      server to get the information for that TLD or to find out that the TLD
      does not exist. Research shows that the vast majority of queries going
      to the root are for names that do not exist in the root zone.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">Many of the queries from recursive resolvers to root servers get
      answers that are referrals to other servers. Malicious third parties
      might be able to observe that traffic on the network between the
      recursive resolver and root servers.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">The primary goals of this design are to provide more reliable answers
      for queries to the root zone during network attacks that affect the root
      servers and to prevent 
      queries and responses from being visible on the network. This design
      will probably have little effect on getting faster responses to the stub
      resolver for good queries on TLDs, because the TTL for most TLDs is
      usually long-lived (on the order of a day or two) and is thus usually
      already in the cache of the recursive resolver; the same is true for the
      TTL for negative answers from the root servers. (Although the primary
      goal of the design is for serving the root zone, the method can be
      used for any zone.)</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">This document describes a method for the operator of a recursive
      resolver to have a complete root zone locally and to hide queries for the root zone
      from outsiders. The basic idea is to create an up-to-date root zone
      service on the same host as the recursive server and use that service
      when the recursive resolver looks up root information. The recursive
      resolver validates all responses from the root service on the same host,
      just as it would validate all responses from a remote root server.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">This design explicitly only allows the new root zone service to be run
      on the same server as the recursive resolver in order to prevent the
      server from serving authoritative answers to any other system.
      Specifically, the root service on the local system <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be configured to
      only answer queries from resolvers on the same host and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
      answer queries from any other resolver.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">At the time that <xref target="RFC7706" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7706">RFC 7706</xref> was
      published, it was considered 
      controversial, because there was not consensus on whether this was a "best
      practice". In fact, many people felt that it is an excessively risky
      practice, because it introduced a new operational piece to local DNS
      operations where there was not one before. Since then, the DNS
      operational community has largely shifted to believing that local
      serving of the root zone for an individual resolver is a reasonable
      practice. The advantages listed above do not come free: if this new
      system does not work correctly, users can get bad data, or the entire
      recursive resolution system might fail in ways that are hard to
      diagnose.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">This design uses an authoritative service running on the
      same machine as the recursive resolver.
      Common open source recursive
      resolver software does not need to add new functionality to
      act as an authoritative server for some zones, but other
      recursive resolver software might need to be able to talk to an
      authoritative server running on the same host.
      Some resolver software supports being both an authoritative server
      and a resolver but separated by logical "views", allowing a local
      root to be implemented within a single process; examples of this
      can be seen in <xref target="examples" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix B"/>.</t>

        <t pn="section-1.1-1">RFC 7706 explicitly required that
	a root server instance be run 
        on the loopback interface of the host running the validating resolver.
        However, RFC 7706 also had examples
	of how to set up common software 
        that did not use the loopback interface. This document loosens
        the restriction on using the loopback interface and in fact
        allows the use of a local service, not necessarily an
        authoritative server. However, the document keeps the requirement that only
        systems running on that single host be able to query that authoritative root

      the SOA record in the root zone, as described in
      <xref target="RFC1035" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1035"/>. This inherently means that
      the contents of the local  
      root zone will likely be a little behind those of the global root
      servers, because those servers are updated when triggered by NOTIFY
      messages.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-5">There is a risk that a system using a local authoritative server for the
      root zone cannot refresh the contents of the root zone before the expire time
      in the SOA. A system using a local authoritative server for the root zone
      <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> serve stale data for the root zone. To mitigate
      the risk that stale 
      data is served, the local root server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> immediately switch to using
      non-local root servers when it detects that it would be serving state data.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-6">In a resolver that is using an internal service for the root zone,
      if the contents of the root zone cannot be refreshed before the
      expire time in the SOA, the resolver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> immediately switch to
      using non-local root servers.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-7">In the event that refreshing the contents of the root zone fails, the
      results can be disastrous. For example, sometimes all the NS records for
      a TLD are changed in a short period of time (such as 2 days); if the
      refreshing of the local root zone is broken during that time, the
      recursive resolver will have bad data for the entire TLD zone.</t>
      <t pn="section-3-8">An administrator using the procedure in this document <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have an
      automated method to check that the contents of the local root zone are
      being refreshed; this might be part of the resolver software. One way to
      do this is to have a separate process that periodically checks the SOA
      of the local root zone and makes sure that it is
      changing. At the time that this document is published, the SOA for the
      root zone is the digital representation of the current date with a
      two-digit counter appended, and the SOA is changed every day even if the
      contents of the root zone are unchanged. For example, the SOA of the
      root zone on January 2, 2019 was 2019010201. A process can use this fact
      to create a check for the contents of the local root zone (using a
      program not specified in this document).</t>

Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root servers by third parties.  Such resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent observation of requests by running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such as 127.0.0.1). This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility for the operator.</t>

            zone, just as it would using the traditional "root hints" method.
            Thus, as the zone in the other view or instance is refreshed or
            updated, changed information will not appear in the recursive
            server until the TTL of the old record times out. Currently, the
            TTL for DS and delegation NS records is two days. When using the
