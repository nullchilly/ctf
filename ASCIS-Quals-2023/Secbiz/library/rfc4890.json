Mohacsi"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"38","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IPv6 Operations","abstract":"In networks supporting IPv6, the Internet Control Message Protocol\r\nversion 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of\r\nfunctions, and a correspondingly large number of message types and\r\noptions.  ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning of IPv6, but there\r\nare a number of security risks associated with uncontrolled\r\nforwarding of ICMPv6 messages.  Filtering strategies designed for the\r\ncorresponding protocol, ICMP, in IPv4 networks are not directly\r\napplicable, because these strategies are intended to accommodate a\r\nuseful auxiliary protocol that may not be required for correct\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\nThis document provides some recommendations for ICMPv6 firewall\r\nfilter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6 messages\r\nthat are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop\r\nmessages that are potential security risks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2007","keywords":["Internet Control Message Protocol version 6","ipv6","security","filter","firewall","icmpv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4890","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4890"}
