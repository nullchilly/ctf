This is\r\ncomplicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF\r\nworking groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and\r\nother WGs that use IPsec and\/or IKE to protect their protocols'\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nThis document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs.  It\r\nincludes a brief description of each RFC, along with background\r\ninformation explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's\r\noutgrowths and extensions.  It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous \r\n\"IP Security Document Roadmap.\"\r\n\r\nThe obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the\r\ninterrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents.\r\nThe major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents\r\nof documents specifying additional encryption and authentication\r\nalgorithms.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["internet protocol","privacy","authentication"],"obsoletes":["RFC2411"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6071","errata_url":null}
