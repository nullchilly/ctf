The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state\r\ninformation allows the PCE to compute constrained paths while\r\nconsidering individual LSPs and their interactions.  This requires a\r\nState Synchronization mechanism between the PCE and the network, the\r\nPCE and Path Computation Clients (PCCs), and cooperating PCEs.  The\r\nbasic mechanism for State Synchronization is part of the stateful PCE\r\nspecification.  This document presents motivations for optimizations\r\nto the base State Synchronization procedure and specifies the required\r\nPath Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions.\r\n","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["Stateful PCE","state synchronization","optimization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8232","errata_url":null}
