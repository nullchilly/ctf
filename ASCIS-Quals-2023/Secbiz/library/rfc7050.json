The method depends on the existence of a well-known\r\nIPv4-only fully qualified domain name \"ipv4only.arpa.\".  The\r\ninformation learned enables nodes to perform local IPv6 address\r\nsynthesis and to potentially avoid NAT64 on dual-stack and\r\nmulti-interface deployments.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["NAT64","DNS64","464XLAT","Pref64::\/n"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8880"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7050","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7050"}
