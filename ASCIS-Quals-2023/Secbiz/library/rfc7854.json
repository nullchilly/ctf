BMP is intended to provide a\r\nconvenient interface for obtaining route views.  Prior to the\r\nintroduction of BMP, screen scraping was the most commonly used\r\napproach to obtaining such views.  The design goals are to keep BMP\r\nsimple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service affecting.\r\nBMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["IDR","BGP","GROW","BMP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8671","RFC9069"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7854","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7854"}
