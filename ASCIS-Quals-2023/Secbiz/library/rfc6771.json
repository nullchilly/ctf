IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to\r\nhold informal get-togethers to discuss and develop their ideas.  Such\r\nside meetings, which are not reflected in the IETF meeting agenda and\r\nhave no official status, are often half-jokingly referred to as \"bar                \r\nBOF\" sessions to acknowledge that some of them may eventually lead to\r\na proposal for an official IETF BOF (\"birds of a feather\" session) on\r\na given topic.\r\n\r\nDuring recent IETF meetings, many such \"bar BOF\" get-togethers have\r\nbeen organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly\r\nindistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF\r\nworking group meetings.\r\n\r\nThis document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in\r\nreaching the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to\r\nefficiently discuss and develop ideas for new IETF work.  It\r\nencourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding them in\r\nmuch less formal settings and to also consider alternative means to\r\ndevelop their ideas.  This document also recommends that the\r\ncommunity abandon the term \"bar BOF\" and instead use other terms such\r\nas \"side meeting\", in order to stress the unofficial nature of these\r\nget-togethers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.\r\n\r\n","pub_date":"October 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6771","errata_url":null}
