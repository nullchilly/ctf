This document is an attempt to codify, and thus\r\nclarify, the ways that both providers and consumers of these feedback\r\nmechanisms intend to use the feedback, describing some already common\r\nindustry practices.\r\n\r\nThis document is the result of cooperative efforts within the\r\nMessaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization separate\r\nfrom the IETF.  The original MAAWG document upon which this document\r\nis based was published in April, 2010.  This document does not\r\nrepresent the consensus of the IETF; rather it is being published as\r\nan Informational RFC to make it widely available to the Internet\r\ncommunity and simplify reference to this material from IETF work.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":["MAAWG","ARF","MARF","feedback loop","spam reporting"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6449","errata_url":null}
