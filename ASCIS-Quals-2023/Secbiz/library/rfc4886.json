Such a type of network is\r\nreferred to as a mobile network.  With appropriate mechanisms,\r\nsessions established between nodes in the mobile network and the\r\nglobal Internet can be maintained after the mobile router changes its\r\npoint of attachment.  This document outlines the goals expected from\r\nnetwork mobility support and defines the requirements that must be\r\nmet by the NEMO Basic Support solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["nemo"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4886","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4886"}
