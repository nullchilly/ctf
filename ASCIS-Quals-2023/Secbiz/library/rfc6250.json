In particular, it attempts to\r\ndocument the properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper-\r\nlayer protocols and applications, especially properties that were\r\n(and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived to exist as well as\r\nproperties that would cause problems if changed.  The discussion of\r\nthese properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or\r\nmisconceptions.  Finally, this document provides some guidance to\r\nprotocol designers and implementers.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["Internet Protocol","IPv4","IPv6","service model"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6250","errata_url":null}
