It defines an SSH user authentication\r\nmethod that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to authenticate a user,\r\nand a family of SSH key exchange methods that use GSS-API to\r\nauthenticate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\r\n\r\nThis memo also defines a new host public key algorithm that can be\r\nused when no operations are needed using a host's public key, and a\r\nnew user authentication method that allows an authorization name to\r\nbe used in conjunction with any authentication that has already\r\noccurred as a side-effect of GSS-API-based key exchange.
