This network\r\nreachability information includes information on the list of\r\nAutonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses.\r\nThis information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS\r\nconnectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be\r\npruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced.\r\n\r\nBGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless\r\nInter-Domain Routing (CIDR).  These mechanisms\r\ninclude support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and\r\neliminating the concept of network \"class\" within BGP.  BGP-4 also\r\nintroduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including\r\naggregation of AS paths.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 1771.
