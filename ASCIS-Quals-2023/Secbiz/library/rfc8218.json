Considering the\r\ncharacteristics of MANETs, especially the dynamic network topology,\r\nusing multiple paths can increase aggregated throughput and improve\r\nthe reliability by avoiding single route failures.  The\r\ninteroperability with OLSRv2 is retained.","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":["MANET"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8218","errata_url":null}
