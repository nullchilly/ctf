Network\r\ntraffic information at the BGP community granularity is useful for\r\nnetwork traffic analysis and engineering.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":["community","BGP","IPFIX"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8549","errata_url":null}
