The functions of this protocol are to select\r\npackets from a stream according to a set of standardized\r\nSelectors, to form a stream of reports on the selected packets,\r\nand to export the reports to a Collector.  This framework details\r\nthe components of this architecture, then describes some generic\r\nrequirements, motivated by the dual aims of ubiquitous deployment\r\nand utility of the reports for applications.  Detailed\r\nrequirements for selection, reporting, and exporting are\r\ndescribed, along with configuration requirements of the PSAMP\r\nfunctions.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["psamp","selector","collector"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5474","errata_url":null}
