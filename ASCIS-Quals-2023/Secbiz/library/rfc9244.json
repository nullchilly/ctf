It specifies the normal\r\ntraffic baseline and attack traffic telemetry attributes a DOTS\r\nclient can convey to its DOTS server in the mitigation request, the\r\nmitigation status telemetry attributes a DOTS server can communicate\r\nto a DOTS client, and the mitigation efficacy telemetry attributes a\r\nDOTS client can communicate to a DOTS server. The telemetry\r\nattributes can assist the mitigator in choosing the DDoS mitigation\r\ntechniques and performing optimal DDoS attack mitigation.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies two YANG modules: one for representing DOTS\r\ntelemetry message types and one for sharing the attack mapping\r\ndetails over the DOTS data channel.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["automation","cybersecurity","DDoS","Resilience","Intelligence","Service delivery","Robustness","Collaborative"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9244","errata_url":null}
