It provides an incrementally deployable\r\napproach for scalability, provider independence, mobility,\r\nmultihoming, traffic engineering, and security.  This document\r\ndescribes a series of use cases in order to showcase the\r\narchitectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER\r\narchitecture restores the network-within-network principles\r\noriginally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["Encapsulation","Tunnel","Architecture","Scalability","Mobility","MANET","Security","IPv6","Aerospace","IRON","VET","SEAL","ISATAP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6139","errata_url":null}
