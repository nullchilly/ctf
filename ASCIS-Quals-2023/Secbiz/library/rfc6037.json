The procedures\r\nspecified in this document are largely a subset of the generalized MVPN\r\nframework recently standardized by the IETF.  However, as the\r\ndeployment of the procedures specified herein predates the\r\npublication of IETF standards (in some cases by over five years), an\r\nimplementation based on these procedures differs in some respects\r\nfrom a fully standards-compliant implementation.  These differences\r\nare pointed out in the document.  This document defines a Historic \r\nDocument for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["mvpn"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6037","errata_url":null}
