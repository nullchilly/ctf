The fundamental goal\r\nis self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization,\r\nself-healing, and self-protection.  This is achieved by an autonomic\r\nfunction having minimal dependencies on human administrators or\r\ncentralized management systems.  It usually implies distribution\r\nacross network elements.\r\n\r\nThis document defines common language and outlines design goals (and\r\nwhat are not design goals) for autonomic functions.  A high-level\r\nreference model illustrates how functional elements in an Autonomic\r\nNetwork interact.  This document is a product of the IRTF's Network\r\nManagement Research Group.","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["self-management","self-chop","autonomic","secure by default","simplification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7575","errata_url":null}
