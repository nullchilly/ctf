The workshop was hosted by the University of\r\nCambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK.  The goal\r\nof the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols,\r\nthrough examination of a variety of economic models, with particular\r\nemphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the\r\nprotocol stack).  This report summarizes contributions and\r\ndiscussions.  As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set\r\nof recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time.\r\nInstead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted\r\nareas that deserve further exploration.\r\n\r\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\r\nworkshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are\r\nthose of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB\r\nviews and positions.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7305","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7305"}
