Only the holder of the secret key can\r\ncompute the hash, but anyone with the public key can verify the\r\ncorrectness of the hash. VRFs are useful for preventing enumeration\r\nof hash-based data structures. This document specifies VRF\r\nconstructions based on RSA and elliptic curves that are secure in the\r\ncryptographic random oracle model. \r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)\r\nin the IRTF.","pub_date":"August 2023","keywords":["public key cryptography","hashing","authenticated denial"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9381","errata_url":null}
