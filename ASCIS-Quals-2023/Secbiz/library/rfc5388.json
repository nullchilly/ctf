This document first\r\ndescribes the terminology used in this document and the traceroute\r\ntool itself; afterwards, the common information model is defined,\r\ndividing the information elements into two semantically separated\r\ngroups (configuration elements and results elements).  Moreover, an\r\nadditional element is defined to relate configuration elements and\r\nresults elements by means of a common unique identifier.  On the\r\nbasis of the information model, a data model based on XML is defined\r\nto store the results of traceroute measurements.
