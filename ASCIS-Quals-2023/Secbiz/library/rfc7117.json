This solution has certain limitations for certain\r\nVPLS multicast traffic profiles.  For example, it may result in highly\r\nnon-optimal bandwidth utilization when a large amount of multicast\r\ntraffic is to be transported.\r\n\r\nThis document describes solutions for overcoming a subset of the\r\nlimitations of the existing VPLS multicast solution.  It describes\r\nprocedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the\r\nservice provider (SP) network.  The solution described in this\r\ndocument allows sharing of one such multicast tree among multiple\r\nVPLS instances.  Furthermore, the solution described in this document\r\nallows a single multicast tree in the SP network to carry traffic\r\nbelonging only to a specified set of one or more IP multicast streams\r\nfrom one or more VPLS instances.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7117","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7117"}
