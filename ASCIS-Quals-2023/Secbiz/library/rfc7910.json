It allows PIM to track\r\nVRRP state and to preserve multicast traffic upon failover in a\r\nredundant network with virtual routing groups enabled.  The mechanism\r\ndescribed in this document is based on Cisco IOS software\r\nimplementation.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7910","errata_url":null}
