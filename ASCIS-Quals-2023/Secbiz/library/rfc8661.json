A segment can represent any instruction, topological or\r\nservice based. SR allows enforcing a flow through any topological\r\npath while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the\r\nSR domain.\r\n\r\nThe Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS\r\ndata plane with no change in the forwarding plane. This document\r\ndescribes how Segment Routing MPLS operates in a network where LDP is\r\ndeployed and in the case where SR-capable and non-SR-capable nodes\r\ncoexist.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["SR-MPLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8661","errata_url":null}
