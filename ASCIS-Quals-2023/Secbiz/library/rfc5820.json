The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay),\r\ninclude mechanisms for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface,\r\na simple technique to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting\r\nincremental state changes, and a method for optimized flooding of\r\nrouting updates.  OSPF-OR also provides a means to reduce unnecessary\r\nadjacencies to support larger MANETs.
