The current Extensible Authentication Protocol\r\n(EAP) keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication\r\nand handovers without re-executing an EAP method.  This often causes\r\nunacceptable latency in various mobile wireless environments.  This\r\ndocument details the problem and defines design goals for a generic\r\nmechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2008","keywords":["hokey","handover key management","fast re-authentication","mobility"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5169","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5169"}
