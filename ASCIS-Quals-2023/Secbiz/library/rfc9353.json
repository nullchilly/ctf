The IGP extensions for PCE Discovery\r\n(PCED) (RFCs 5088 and 5089) define a method to advertise path\r\ncomputation capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF and IS-IS,\r\nrespectively. However, these specifications lack a method to\r\nadvertise Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\r\nsecurity (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS) and TCP Authentication\r\nOption (TCP-AO)) support capability.\r\n\r\nThis document defines capability flag bits for the PCE-CAP-FLAGS\r\nsub-TLV that can be announced as an attribute in the IGP\r\nadvertisement to distribute PCEP security support information. In\r\naddition, this document updates RFCs 5088 and 5089 to allow\r\nadvertisement of a Key ID or KEY-CHAIN-NAME sub-TLV to support TCP-AO\r\nsecurity capability. This document also updates RFCs 8231 and 8306.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":["Path Computation Element"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5088","RFC5089","RFC8231","RFC8306"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9353","errata_url":null}
