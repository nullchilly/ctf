They allow\r\na node to receive packets directed at its address by allowing another\r\ndevice to perform Neighbor Discovery operations on its behalf.\r\n\r\nNeighbor Discovery Proxy is used in Mobile IPv6 and related protocols\r\nto provide reachability from nodes on the home network when a Mobile\r\nNode is not at home, by allowing the Home Agent to act as proxy.  It\r\nis also used as a mechanism to allow a global prefix to span multiple\r\nlinks, where proxies act as relays for Neighbor Discovery messages.\r\n\r\nNeighbor Discovery Proxy currently cannot be secured using Secure\r\nNeighbor Discovery (SEND).  Today, SEND assumes that a node\r\nadvertising an address is the address owner and in possession of\r\nappropriate public and private keys for that node.  This document\r\ndescribes how existing practice for proxy Neighbor Discovery relates\r\nto SEND.
