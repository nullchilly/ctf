In many cases, these devices do\r\nnot provide user interfaces, and they are often intended to interact\r\nwithout human intervention.\r\n\r\nThis document includes a collection of representative use cases for\r\nauthentication and authorization in constrained environments.  These\r\nuse cases aim at identifying authorization problems that arise during\r\nthe life cycle of a constrained device and are intended to provide a\r\nguideline for developing a comprehensive authentication and\r\nauthorization solution for this class of scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhere specific details are relevant, it is assumed that the devices\r\nuse the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a communication\r\nprotocol.  However, most conclusions apply generally.","pub_date":"January 2016","keywords":["Internet of Things","IoT","Smart Object","Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7744","errata_url":null}
