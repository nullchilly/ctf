This document defines a mechanism for securely identifying\r\noriginators of SIP messages.  It does so by defining two new SIP\r\nheader fields, Identity, for conveying a signature used for\r\nvalidating the identity, and Identity-Info, for conveying a reference\r\nto the certificate of the signer.
