It can be used to support the\r\ndevelopment and validation of certification paths well after the\r\nexpiration of the certificates in the path by specifying a time of\r\ninterest in the past.  The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) defines\r\nstructures, called evidence records, to support the non-repudiation\r\nof the existence of data.  Evidence records can be used to preserve\r\nmaterials that comprise a certification path such that trust in the\r\ncertificates can be established after the expiration of the\r\ncertificates in the path and after the cryptographic algorithms used\r\nto sign the certificates in the path are no longer secure.  This\r\ndocument describes usage of the SCVP WantBack feature to convey\r\nevidence records, enabling SCVP responders to provide preservation\r\nevidence for certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"August 2008","keywords":["[--------]","ERS","Evidence Record","SCVP","Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol","PKI artifact preservation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5276","errata_url":null}
