This will allow\r\nreviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents\r\nthat have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of\r\nvaluable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented\r\nprotocols more mature.\r\n\r\nThe process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of\r\nInternet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for\r\ntheir documents, and working groups are invited to think about\r\napplying the process to all of their protocol specifications.  The\r\nauthors of this document intend to collate experiences with this\r\nexperiment and to report them to the community.","pub_date":"July 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7942"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6982","errata_url":null}
