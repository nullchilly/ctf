This document\r\ndescribes ways to design LGRs to support variant labels.  In\r\ndesigning LGRs, it is important to ensure that the label generation\r\nrules are consistent and well behaved in the presence of variants.\r\nThe design decisions can then be expressed using the XML\r\nrepresentation of LGRs that is defined in RFC 7940.","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":["LGR","Variant","IDN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8228","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8228"}
