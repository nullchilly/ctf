It depends only on \"segments\" that are advertised by\r\nlink-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). An SR path can be\r\nderived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path\r\nTree (SPT), an explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element\r\n(PCE). This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation\r\nElement Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to\r\ncompute and initiate Traffic-Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a\r\nPath Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject to certain\r\nconstraints and optimization criteria in SR networks.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 8408.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["SR","Traffic-Engineering","PCE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8408"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8664","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8664"}
