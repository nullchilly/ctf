NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not\r\ncatered for by established (standard) identifier systems such as\r\nInternational Standard Book Number (ISBN).\r\n\r\nA Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in\r\n2001 in RFC 3188.  Since then, a number of European national\r\nlibraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.\r\n\r\nThis document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported\r\nwithin the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration\r\n(version 4) compliant to RFC 8141 is included.","pub_date":"October 2018","keywords":["Network Working Group","National bibliography numbers","Uniform resource names"],"obsoletes":["RFC3188"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8458","errata_url":null}
