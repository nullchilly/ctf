This\r\ndocument clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no\r\nmeaning and that the entire identifier should be treated as an opaque\r\nvalue.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the\r\nUniversal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped\r\ninto an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies\r\nthat those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving\r\ninterface identifiers from an IEEE link-layer address, and it updates\r\nRFC 4291 accordingly.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4291"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7136","errata_url":null}
