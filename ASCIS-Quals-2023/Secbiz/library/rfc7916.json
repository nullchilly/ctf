Following early\r\ndeployment experiences, this document provides operational feedback\r\non LFAs, highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of\r\nrefinements to address those limitations.  It also proposes required\r\nmanagement specifications.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is also applicable to remote-LFA solutions.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["IGP","LFA","policy","FRR","fast reroute","network planning"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7916","errata_url":null}
