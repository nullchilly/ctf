This\r\ndocument establishes the important concepts for benchmarking network\r\nswitches and routers in the data center and is a prerequisite for the\r\ntest methodology document (RFC 8239).  Many of these terms and\r\nmethods may be applicable to network equipment beyond the scope of\r\nthis document as the technologies originally applied in the data\r\ncenter are deployed elsewhere.","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8238","errata_url":null}
