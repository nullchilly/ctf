      <t pn="section-abstract-1">When multiple congestion-controlled Real-time Transport Protocol
      (RTP) sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their
      controls can improve the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of delay,
      loss, and fairness. This document describes such a method for flows that
      have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and simple as
      possible while minimizing the number of changes needed to existing RTP
      applications. This document also specifies how to apply the method for the
      Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) congestion control algorithm
      and provides suggestions on how to apply it to other congestion control
      algorithms.</t>

      <t pn="section-1-1">When there is enough data to send, a congestion controller attempts
      to increase its sending rate until the path's capacity has been reached.
      Some controllers detect path capacity by increasing the sending rate
      further, until packets are 
      ECN-marked <xref target="RFC8087" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8087"/> or dropped, and
      then decreasing the sending rate until that stops happening. This
      process inevitably creates undesirable queuing delay when multiple
      congestion-controlled connections traverse the same network bottleneck,
      and each connection overshoots the path capacity as it determines its
      sending rate. </t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">The Congestion Manager (CM) <xref target="RFC3124" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3124"/>
      couples flows by providing a single congestion controller. It is hard to
      implement because it requires an additional congestion controller and
      removes all per-connection congestion control functionality, which is
      quite a significant change to existing RTP-based applications. This
      document presents a method to combine the behavior of congestion control
      mechanisms that is easier to implement than the Congestion Manager <xref target="RFC3124" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3124"/> and also requires fewer significant
      changes to existing RTP-based applications. It attempts to roughly
      approximate the CM behavior by sharing information between existing
      congestion controllers. It is able to honor user-specified priorities,
      which is required by WebRTC <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RTCWEB-OVERVIEW"/> <xref target="RFC7478" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7478"/>.</t>

      the latter, as it operates inside a single host on the sender side.

        <dd pn="section-3-1.4">
     As per the definition above, a bottleneck depends on cross traffic, and
     since such traffic can heavily fluctuate, bottlenecks can change at a
     high frequency (e.g., there can be oscillation between two or more
     links). This means that, when flows are partially routed along different
     paths, they may quickly change between sharing and not sharing a
     bottleneck. For simplicity, here it is assumed that a shared bottleneck
     is valid for a time interval that is significantly longer than the
     interval at which congestion controllers operate. Note that, for the only
     SBD mechanism defined in this document (multiplexing on the same
     five-tuple), the notion of a shared bottleneck stays correct even in the
     presence of fast traffic fluctuations; since all flows that are assumed
     to share a bottleneck are routed in the same way, if the bottleneck
     changes, it will still be shared.</dd>

      <t pn="section-4-1"><xref target="fig_1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/> shows the elements of the architecture for coupled
      congestion control: the Flow State Exchange (FSE), Shared Bottleneck
      Detection (SBD), and Flows. The FSE is a storage element that can be
      implemented in two ways: active and passive. In the active version, it
      initiates communication with flows and SBD. However, in the passive
      version, it does not actively initiate communication with flows and SBD;
      its only active role is internal state maintenance (e.g., an
      implementation could use soft state to remove a flow's data after long
      periods of inactivity). Every time a flow's congestion control mechanism
      would normally update its sending rate, the flow instead updates
      information in the FSE and performs a query on the FSE, leading to a
      sending rate that can be different from what the congestion controller
      originally determined. Using information about/from the currently active
      flows, SBD updates the FSE with the correct Flow Group Identifiers
      (FGIs).
      </t>
      <t pn="section-4-2"> This document describes both active and passive versions. While the
      passive algorithm works better for congestion controls with
      RTT-independent convergence, it can still produce oscillations on short
      time scales.  The passive algorithm, described in <xref target="example-alg-pas" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix C"/>, is therefore considered
      highly experimental and not safe to deploy outside of testbed
      environments. <xref target="fig_2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/> shows the interaction between flows

      form of Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Such an implementation would
      extend the scope to flows generated by multiple applications. The FSE
      and SBD could also be included in the Operating System kernel. However,
      only one type of coupling algorithm should be used for all
      flows. Combinations of multiple algorithms at different aggregation

          and the ECN field in the IP header are typically treated in the same
          way along the path.  This method is the only one specified in this

          same five-tuple, DSCP, and ECN field value to belong to the same
          FG. This classification applies to certain tunnels or RTP flows
          that are multiplexed over one transport (cf. <xref target="TRANSPORT-MULTIPLEX" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TRANSPORT-MULTIPLEX"/>). Such multiplexing
          is also a recommended usage of RTP in WebRTC <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-rtp-usage" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RTCWEB-RTP-USAGE"/>.</li>

        </ol>
        <t pn="section-5.1-3">The methods above have some essential trade-offs. For example,
        multiplexing is a completely reliable measure, but it is limited
        in scope to two endpoints (i.e., it cannot be applied to couple
        congestion controllers of one sender talking to multiple receivers). A
        measurement-based SBD mechanism is described in <xref target="RFC8382" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8382"/>. Measurements can never be 100% reliable, in
        particular because they are based on the past, but applying coupled
        congestion control involves making an assumption about the future; it is
        therefore recommended to implement cautionary measures, e.g., by
        disabling coupled congestion control if enabling it causes a
        significant increase in delay and/or packet loss.  Measurements also
        take time, which entails a certain delay for turning on coupling
        (refer to <xref target="RFC8382" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8382"/> for details).

When this is possible, it can be more efficient to statically configure shared
bottlenecks (e.g., via a system configuration or user input) based on
assumptions about the network environment.</t>

        may produce a burst that should be mitigated in some way. An example

      supporting wrong values for the calculated rate, desired rate, or

      prevent other flows from sending or make them send at a rate that is
      unreasonably large. The end result would be unfair behavior at the
      network bottleneck, akin to what could be achieved with any UDP-based
      application. Hence, since this is no worse than UDP in general, there
      seems to be no significant harm in using this in the absence of UDP rate

      the user choose them. In a multi-user system, this interest may not be
      given, and one could imagine the worst case of an "arms race" situation
      where applications end up setting their priorities to the maximum

      that is under development. GCC is not yet finalized, but at the time of
      this writing, the rate control of GCC employs two parts: controlling the
      bandwidth estimate based on delay and controlling the bandwidth
      estimate based on loss. Both are designed to estimate the available

      <t pn="section-appendix.b-1"> When flows originate from the same host, it would be possible to use
      only one sender-side congestion controller that determines the
      overall allowed sending rate and then use a local scheduler to assign a
      proportion of this rate to each RTP session. This way, priorities could
      also be implemented as a function of the scheduler. The Congestion

      <t pn="section-appendix.c-1">Active algorithms calculate the rates for all the flows in the FG and
      actively distribute them. In a passive algorithm, UPDATE returns a rate
      that should be used instead of the rate that the congestion controller
      has determined. This can make a passive algorithm easier to implement;
      however, when round-trip times of flows are unequal, flows with shorter RTTs
      may (depending on the congestion control algorithm) update and react to
      the overall FSE state more often than flows with longer RTTs, which can
      produce unwanted side effects. This problem is more significant when the
      congestion control convergence depends on the RTT. While the passive
      algorithm works better for congestion controls with RTT-independent
      convergence, it can still produce oscillations on short time scales. The
      algorithm described below is therefore considered highly experimental
      and not safe to deploy outside of testbed environments. Results of a
      simplified passive FSE algorithm with both NADA and GCC can be found in

      <t pn="section-appendix.c-4">The goals of the flow algorithm are to achieve prioritization,
      improve network utilization in the face of application-limited flows,
      and impose limits on the increase behavior such that the negative impact
      of multiple flows trying to increase their rate together is
      minimized. It does that by assigning a flow a sending rate that may not
      be what the flow's congestion controller expected. It therefore builds
      on the assumption that no significant inefficiencies arise from
      temporary application-limited behavior or from quickly jumping to a rate
      that is higher than the congestion controller intended. How problematic
      these issues really are depends on the controllers in use and requires
      careful per-controller experimentation. The coupled congestion control
      mechanism described here also does not require all controllers to be
      equal; effects of heterogeneous controllers, or homogeneous controllers
      being in different states, are also subject to experimentation.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.c-5">This algorithm gives the leftover rate of application-limited
      flows to the first flow that updates its sending rate, provided that
      this flow needs it all (otherwise, its own leftover rate can be taken by
      the next flow that updates its rate).  Other policies could be applied,
      e.g., to divide the leftover rate of a flow equally among all other flows
      in the FGI.</t>

        <t pn="section-c.1-1">In order to illustrate the operation of the passive coupled
        congestion control algorithm, this section presents a toy example of
        two flows that use it. Let us assume that both flows traverse a common
        10 Mbit/s bottleneck and use a simplistic congestion controller that
        starts out with 1 Mbit/s, increases its rate by 1 Mbit/s in the
        absence of congestion, and decreases it by 2 Mbit/s in the presence of
        congestion. For simplicity, flows are assumed to always operate in a
        round-robin fashion. Rate numbers below without units are assumed to
        be in Mbit/s. For illustration purposes, the actual sending rate is
        also shown for every flow in FSE diagrams even though it is not really
        stored in the FSE.</t>
        <t pn="section-c.1-2">Flow #1 begins. It is a bulk data transfer and considers itself to
        have top priority.  This is the FSE after the flow algorithm's step
        1:</t>
