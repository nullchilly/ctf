In this document, such data\r\ncenters are referred to as \"large-scale\" to differentiate them from\r\nsmaller infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique\r\nset of network requirements with an emphasis on operational\r\nsimplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes\r\noperational experience in designing and operating large-scale data\r\ncenters using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent is to\r\nreport on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged\r\nby others in the industry.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["BGP","ECMP","Clos"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7938","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7938"}
