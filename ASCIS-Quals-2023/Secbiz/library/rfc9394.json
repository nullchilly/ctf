It also clarifies some interactions between\r\nRFC 5267 and RFCs 4731 and 9051.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFCs 4731 and 5267.","pub_date":"June 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4731","RFC5267"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9394","errata_url":null}
