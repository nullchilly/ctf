One way to address this is to create a canonical\r\nrepresentation of the data.  Canonicalization also permits data to be\r\nexchanged in its original form on the \"wire\" while cryptographic\r\noperations performed on the canonicalized counterpart of the data in\r\nthe producer and consumer endpoints generate consistent results. \r\n\r\nThis document describes the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS). This\r\nspecification defines how to create a canonical representation of\r\nJSON data by building on the strict serialization methods for JSON\r\nprimitives defined by ECMAScript, constraining JSON data to the\r\nInternet JSON (I-JSON) subset, and by using deterministic property\r\nsorting.","pub_date":"June 2020","keywords":["JSON","ECMAScript","Signatures","Cryptography","Canonicalization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8785","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8785"}
