Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form\r\n(BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many\r\nInternet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.\r\nIt balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable\r\nrepresentational power.  The differences between standard BNF and\r\nABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives,\r\norder-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also\r\nsupplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical\r\nanalyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.
