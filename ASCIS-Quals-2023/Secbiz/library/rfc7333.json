The hierarchical structure in\r\ntraditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally deployed\r\nmobility anchors.  As some wireless networks are evolving away from\r\nthe hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a distributed\r\nmodel for mobility management in which traffic does not need to\r\ntraverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal\r\nroute.  The motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement\r\nare also described.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":["Distributed Mobility Management","Network function distribution","Flat mobile network","Mobile network operation and management","Control and data plane separation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7333","errata_url":null}
