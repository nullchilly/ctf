TRILL accomplishes this\r\nby using Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link-state routing\r\nand by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count.  Since\r\npublication of the TRILL base protocol in July 2011, active development of\r\nTRILL has revealed errata in  RFC 6325 and some cases that could use\r\nclarifications or updates.\r\n\r\nRFCs 6327 and 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect\r\nto adjacency and Appointed Forwarders.  This document provides other\r\nknown clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFCs 6325, 6327,\r\nand 6439.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["TRILL","RBridge","IS-IS","reachability","overload","MTU","DEI","multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7780"],"updates":["RFC6325","RFC6327","RFC6439"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7180","errata_url":null}
