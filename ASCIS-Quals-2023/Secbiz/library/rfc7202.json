It also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol\r\n(RTP) and the associated RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a\r\nsingle media security mechanism.  This is relevant for designers and\r\nreviewers of future RTP extensions to ensure that appropriate\r\nsecurity mechanisms are mandated and that any such mechanisms are\r\nspecified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["SRTP","RTP Profile","Payload Format"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7202","errata_url":null}
