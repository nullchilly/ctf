It includes information regarding the switch\r\nfabric configuration, the addressing plan and general organizational\r\ntasks that need to be performed.  IXPs are mainly a Layer 2\r\ninfrastructure, and, in many cases, the best recommendations suggest\r\nthat the IPv6 data, control, and management plane should not be\r\nhandled differently than in IPv4.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2010","keywords":["IPv6","IXP","deployment","exchange"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5963","errata_url":null}
