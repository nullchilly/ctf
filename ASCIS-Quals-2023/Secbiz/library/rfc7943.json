This method is a DHCPv6 server-side\r\nalgorithm that does not require any updates to the existing DHCPv6\r\nspecifications.  The aforementioned method results in stable\r\naddresses within each subnet, even in the presence of multiple DHCPv6\r\nservers or DHCPv6 server reinstallments.  It is a DHCPv6 variant of\r\nthe method specified in RFC 7217 for IPv6 Stateless Address\r\nAutoconfiguration.","pub_date":"September 2016","keywords":["security","privacy","resiliency","attack","scanning","tracking"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7943","errata_url":null}
