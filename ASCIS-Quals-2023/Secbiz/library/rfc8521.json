The\r\nmethod does not describe how to identify the authoritative server for\r\nprocessing other RDAP query types, such as entity queries.  This\r\nlimitation exists because the identifiers associated with these query\r\ntypes are typically unstructured.  This document updates RFC 7484 by\r\ndescribing an operational practice that can be used to add structure\r\nto RDAP identifiers and that makes it possible to identify the\r\nauthoritative server for additional RDAP queries.\r\n","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["RDAP","Entity","Bootstrap"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7484"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0221"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8521","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8521"}
