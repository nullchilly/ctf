Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4\r\nencapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.\r\nUnlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in\r\nplace of the fixed 6to4 prefix.  A service provider has used this\r\nmechanism for its own IPv6 \"rapid deployment\": five weeks from first\r\nexposure to 6rd principles to more than 1,500,000 residential sites\r\nbeing provided native IPv6, under the only condition that they\r\nactivate it.
