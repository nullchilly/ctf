SIP provides limited support for overload\r\nhandling through its 503 response code, which tells an upstream\r\nelement that it is overloaded.  However, numerous problems have been\r\nidentified with this mechanism.  This document summarizes the\r\nproblems with the existing 503 mechanism, and provides some\r\nrequirements for a solution.  This memo provides information \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2008","keywords":["sip","overload handling","503 response"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5390","errata_url":null}
