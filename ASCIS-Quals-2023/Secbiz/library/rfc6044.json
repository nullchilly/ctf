Mohali"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"24","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF,\r\nthe non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented\r\nand used for conveying call-diversion-related information in SIP\r\nsignaling.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a recommended interworking guideline between\r\nthe Diversion header and the History-Info header to handle call\r\ndiversion information.  In addition, an interworking policy is\r\nproposed to manage the headers' coexistence.  The History-Info header\r\nis described in RFC 4244 and the non-standard Diversion header is\r\ndescribed, as Historic, in RFC 5806.\r\n\r\nSince the Diversion header is used in many existing network\r\nimplementations for the transport of call diversion information, its\r\ninterworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is\r\nneeded.  This work is intended to enable the migration from non-\r\nstandard implementations and deployment toward IETF specification-\r\nbased implementations and deployment.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7544"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6044","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6044"}
