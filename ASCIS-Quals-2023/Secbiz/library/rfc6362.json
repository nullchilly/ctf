Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a\r\nsingle EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI\r\ndocuments in a single message.  As adoption of EDIINT grew, other\r\nuses developed aside from single EDI document transport.  Some\r\ntransactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together\r\nand stored in a single message.  This Informational RFC describes how\r\nmultiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and\r\ntransmitted in a single EDIINT transport message.  The attachments\r\nare stored within the MIME multipart\/related structure.  A minimal\r\nlist of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2011","keywords":["EDIINT","AS2","Multiple","Attachments"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6362","errata_url":null}
