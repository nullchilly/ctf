HIP\r\nproposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names.\r\nFrom an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new\r\naddress family of host identifiers, but it may be a long time until\r\nsuch HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems\r\nare upgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation\r\nand Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using\r\nHIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the\r\napplications are not, and is intended to aid implementors and early\r\nadopters in thinking about and locally solving systems issues\r\nregarding the incremental deployment of HIP.  This memo provides information \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","hip","cryptographic name space","network stack names","api","application programming interface"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5338","errata_url":null}
