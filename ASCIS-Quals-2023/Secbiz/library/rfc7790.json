Because many protocols perform\r\ncase-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison, it is necessary\r\nto define methods for case mapping.  In addition, both the\r\nInternationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS\r\nproblem statement describe mappings for internationalized strings\r\nthat are not limited to case, but include width mapping and mapping\r\nof delimiters and other special characters that can be taken into\r\nconsideration.  This document provides guidelines for designers of\r\nPRECIS profiles and describes several mappings that can be applied\r\nbetween receiving user input and passing permitted code points to\r\ninternationalized protocols.  In particular, this document describes\r\nboth locale-dependent and context-depending case mappings as well as\r\nadditional mappings for delimiters and special characters.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7790","errata_url":null}
