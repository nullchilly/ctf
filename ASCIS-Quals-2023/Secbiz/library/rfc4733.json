It sets up an\r\nIANA registry to which other event code assignments may be added.\r\nCompanion documents add event codes to this registry relating to\r\nmodem, fax, text telephony, and channel-associated signalling events.\r\nThe remainder of the event codes defined in RFC 2833 are\r\nconditionally reserved in case other documents revive their use.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a number of\r\nclarifications to the original document.  However, it specifically\r\ndiffers from RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all compliant\r\nimplementations support the DTMF events.  Instead, compliant\r\nimplementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media\r\nstream content indicate what events they support.  This memo\r\nadds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework: subdivision of\r\nlong events into segments, reporting of multiple events in a single\r\npacket, and the concept and reporting of state events.
