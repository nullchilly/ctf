The protocol runs within a set of two or more PEs,\r\nforming a Redundancy Group, for the purpose of synchronizing data\r\namong the systems.  It accommodates multi-chassis attachment circuit\r\nredundancy mechanisms as well as pseudowire redundancy mechanisms.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["iccp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7275","errata_url":null}
