TRILL supports multipathing of both unicast and\r\nmulticast traffic.  Devices that implement the TRILL protocol are\r\ncalled TRILL switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).\r\n\r\nESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) is an optional\r\nprotocol by which a TRILL switch can communicate, in a Data Label\r\n(VLAN or fine-grained label) scoped way, end station address and\r\nreachability information to TRILL switches participating in ESADI for\r\nthe relevant Data Label.  This document updates RFC 6325,\r\nspecifically the documentation of the ESADI protocol, and is not\r\nbackwards compatible.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["ESADI","TRILL","RBridge","Address Learning","Reachability","MAC Addresses"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6325"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7357","errata_url":null}
