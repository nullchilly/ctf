This new payload type can be used for various\r\npurposes, such as decreasing encapsulation overhead for small IP\r\npackets; however, the focus in this document is to enhance IP Traffic\r\nFlow Security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC)\r\nto encrypted IP-encapsulated traffic. TFC is provided by obscuring\r\nthe size and frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-size,\r\nconstant-send-rate IPsec tunnel. The solution allows for congestion\r\ncontrol, as well as nonconstant send-rate usage.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9347","errata_url":null}
