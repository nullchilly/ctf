In addition, another metric, repaired loss count, is also\r\nintroduced in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count when\r\nneeded, so that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate the\r\neffectiveness of the repair methods used by the system.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7509","errata_url":null}
