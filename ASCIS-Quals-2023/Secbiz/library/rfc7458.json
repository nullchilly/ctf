This document defines a few\r\nnew EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such\r\nnetworks.  The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a\r\nMobile Node (MN)) and its network counterpart (such as an\r\nAuthentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server) in the\r\nservice provider's infrastructure.","pub_date":"February 2015","keywords":["Mobile Networks","3GPP","EAP","EPC","Handover","Identity","APN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7458","errata_url":null}
