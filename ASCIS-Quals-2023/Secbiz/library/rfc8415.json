DHCPv6 can operate either in place of or in addition to\r\nstateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC).\r\n\r\nThis document updates the text from RFC 3315 (the original DHCPv6\r\nspecification) and incorporates prefix delegation (RFC 3633),\r\nstateless DHCPv6 (RFC 3736), an option to specify an upper bound for\r\nhow long a client should wait before refreshing information (RFC\r\n4242), a mechanism for throttling DHCPv6 clients when DHCPv6 service\r\nis not available (RFC 7083), and relay agent handling of unknown\r\nmessages (RFC 7283).  In addition, this document clarifies the\r\ninteractions between models of operation (RFC 7550).  As such, this\r\ndocument obsoletes RFC 3315, RFC 3633, RFC 3736, RFC 4242, RFC 7083,\r\nRFC 7283, and RFC 7550.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["DHCPv6","IPv6","DHCP"],"obsoletes":["RFC3315","RFC3633","RFC3736","RFC4242","RFC7083","RFC7283","RFC7550"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8415","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8415"}
