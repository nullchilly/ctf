An LLN is typically composed of many embedded\r\ndevices with limited power, memory, and processing resources\r\ninterconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of\r\napplication areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building\r\nautomation (e.g., heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting,\r\naccess control, fire), connected home, health care, environmental\r\nmonitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets\r\ntracking, and refrigeration.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7102","errata_url":null}
