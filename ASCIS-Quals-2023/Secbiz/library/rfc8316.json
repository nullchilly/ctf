The use case is for detecting violations of SLAs in a\r\ndistributed fashion.  It strives to optimize and dynamically adapt\r\nthe autonomic deployment of active measurement probes in a way that\r\nmaximizes the likelihood of detecting service-level violations with a\r\ngiven resource budget to perform active measurements.  This\r\noptimization and adaptation should be done without any outside\r\nguidance or intervention.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research\r\nGroup (NMRG).
