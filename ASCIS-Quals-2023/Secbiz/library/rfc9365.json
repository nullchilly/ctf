The main scenarios of vehicular communications are\r\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and\r\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. First, this document\r\nexplains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Next, for\r\nIPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current\r\nIPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility management,\r\nas well as security and privacy).","pub_date":"March 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9365","errata_url":null}
