SDL provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links, and RFCs 1662 and 2615 provide a means to carry PPP over Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) circuits.  SDL provides a very low overhead alternative to HDLC-like encapsulation, and can also be used on SONET\/SDH links.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
