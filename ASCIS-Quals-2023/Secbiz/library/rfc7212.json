These protocols are commonly used to provide Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms associated with the\r\nprimary data channel.  This document specifies simple procedures by\r\nwhich an endpoint of an LSP, pseudowire, or section may inform the\r\nother endpoints of its capabilities and configuration parameters, or\r\nother application-specific information.  This information may then be\r\nused by the receiver to validate or adjust its local configuration,\r\nand by the network operator for diagnostic purposes.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7212","errata_url":null}
