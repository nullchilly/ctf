Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was defined with\r\nsupport for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The\r\nutilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully\r\nmitigate the reroute process of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief\r\nperiod soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not\r\nnecessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the\r\nTE LSP(s) can be rerouted.  For this reason, the feature is\r\nprimarily, but not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP\r\nnetworks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering\r\ncapabilities.
