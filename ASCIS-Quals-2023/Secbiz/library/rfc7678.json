This document\r\nenumerates the information that needs to be provisioned on a customer\r\nedge router to support a list of transition techniques based on\r\ntunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to defining reusable components\r\nfor a reasonable transition path between these techniques.  To the\r\nextent that the provisioning is done dynamically, Authentication,\r\nAuthorization, and Accounting (AAA) support is needed to provide the\r\ninformation to the network server responsible for passing the\r\ninformation to the customer equipment.  This document specifies\r\nDiameter (RFC 6733) Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) to be used for that\r\npurpose.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["DS-Lite","Lightweight 4over6","MAP-E","IPv4 service continuity","IPv6 deployment","IPv4 address sharing","Diameter","Multicast","IPv4 over IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7678","errata_url":null}
