Today, network elements at any layer may signal\r\ncongestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by Explicit\r\nCongestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver passes this\r\ninformation back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.  The\r\nmechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this\r\ncongestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer,\r\nsuch that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the\r\npath is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could,\r\nfor example, be used to provide input to traffic management.  This\r\nmechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx.  The companion\r\ndocument, \"Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases\"\r\n(RFC 6789), provides the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["Quality of Service","QoS","Congestion Control","Signaling","Protocol","Encoding","Audit","Policing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7713","errata_url":null}
