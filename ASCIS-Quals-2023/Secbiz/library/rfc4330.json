{"draft":"draft-mills-sntp-v4-01","doc_id":"RFC4330","title":"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI","authors":["D. Mills"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"27","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":"This memorandum describes the Simple Network Time Protocol\r\nVersion 4 (SNTPv4), which is a subset of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) used\r\nto synchronize computer clocks in the Internet.  SNTPv4 can be used when\r\nthe ultimate performance of a full NTP implementation based on\r\nRFC 1305 is neither needed nor justified.  When operating with current\r\nand previous NTP and SNTP versions, SNTPv4 requires no changes to the\r\nspecifications or known implementations, but rather clarifies certain\r\ndesign features that allow operation in a simple, stateless\r\nremote-procedure call (RPC) mode with accuracy and reliability\r\nexpectations similar to the UDP\/TIME protocol described in RFC 868.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum obsoletes RFC 1769, which describes SNTP Version\r\n3 (SNTPv3), and RFC 2030, which describes SNTPv4.  Its purpose is to\r\ncorrect certain inconsistencies in the previous documents and to\r\nclarify header formats and protocol operations for NTPv3 (IPv4) and\r\nSNTPv4 (IPv4, IPv6, and OSI), which are also used for SNTP.  A further\r\npurpose is to provide guidance for home and business client\r\nimplementations for routers and other consumer devices to protect\r\nthe server population from abuse.  A working knowledge of the NTPv3\r\nspecification, RFC 1305, is not required for an\r\nimplementation of SNTP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2005","keywords":["NTP","time","computer","clock","synchronization"],"obsoletes":["RFC2030","RFC1769"],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5905"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4330","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4330"}
