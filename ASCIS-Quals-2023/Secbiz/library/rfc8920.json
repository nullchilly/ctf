Since the\r\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\r\nSegment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use\r\nof the link attribute advertisements have been defined.  In cases\r\nwhere multiple applications wish to make use of these link\r\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support\r\napplication-specific values for a given attribute, nor do they\r\nsupport indication of which applications are using the advertised\r\nvalue for a given link.  This document introduces new link attribute\r\nadvertisements in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 that address both of these\r\nshortcomings.","pub_date":"October 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9492"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8920","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8920"}
