These new groups are defined to align\r\nIKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards,\r\nparticularly NIST standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can\r\nprovide more efficient implementation than previously defined ECC\r\ngroups.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2007","keywords":["elliptic curve","Diffie-Hellman","suite b","nist curve"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5903"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4753","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4753"}
