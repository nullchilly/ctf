A node\r\nsteers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called\r\nsegments. Segment Routing can be applied to the Multiprotocol Label\r\nSwitching (MPLS) data plane.  Entropy labels (ELs) are used in MPLS\r\nto improve load-balancing. This document examines and describes how\r\nELs are to be applied to Segment Routing MPLS.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["Flow-aware load balancing","ECMP (equal-cost multipath)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8662","errata_url":null}
