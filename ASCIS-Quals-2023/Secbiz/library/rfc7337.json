As a result of\r\nsignificant growth in content delivered over IP networks, existing\r\nCDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure.  Many Network\r\nService Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise Service Providers (ESPs) are\r\nalso deploying their own CDNs.  To deliver contents from the Content\r\nService Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across\r\nmultiple CDNs.  This creates a need for interconnecting (previously)\r\nstandalone CDNs so that they can collectively act as a single\r\ndelivery platform from the CSP to the end users.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for\r\nthe solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working\r\ngroup.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7337","errata_url":null}
