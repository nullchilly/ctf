When the QUIC DATAGRAM frame is unavailable or\r\nundesirable, HTTP Datagrams can be sent using the Capsule Protocol,\r\nwhich is a more general convention for conveying data in HTTP\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nHTTP Datagrams and the Capsule Protocol are intended for use by HTTP\r\nextensions, not applications.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["quic","http","datagram","fast","tunnels","turtles all the way down","masque","http-ng"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9297","errata_url":null}
