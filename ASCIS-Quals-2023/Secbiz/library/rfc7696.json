Communicating peers must\r\nsupport a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work\r\nproperly.  This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the\r\nability to migrate from one mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another\r\nover time.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0201"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7696","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7696"}
