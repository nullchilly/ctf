This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than\r\nwould be possible using the existing S\/MIME or PKIX arcs.  This\r\ndocument describes the donated range and the identifiers that were\r\nassigned from that range, transfers control of that range to IANA,\r\nand establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments\r\nwithin that range.","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8411","errata_url":null}
