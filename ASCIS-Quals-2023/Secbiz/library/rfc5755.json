Attribute certificates may be\r\nused in a wide range of applications and environments covering a\r\nbroad spectrum of interoperability goals and a broader spectrum of\r\noperational and assurance requirements.  The goal of this document is\r\nto establish a common baseline for generic applications requiring\r\nbroad interoperability as well as limited special purpose\r\nrequirements.  The profile places emphasis on attribute certificate\r\nsupport for Internet electronic mail, IPsec, and WWW security\r\napplications.  This document obsoletes RFC 3281.
