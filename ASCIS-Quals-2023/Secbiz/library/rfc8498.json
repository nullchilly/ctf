Mohali"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"15","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Session Initiation Protocol Core","abstract":"The P-Served-User header field was defined based on a requirement\r\nfrom the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia\r\nSubsystem) in order to convey the identity of the served user, his\/\r\nher registration state, and the session case that applies to that\r\nparticular communication session and application invocation.  A\r\nsession case is metadata that captures the status of the session of a\r\nserved user regardless of whether or not the served user is\r\nregistered or the session originates or terminates with the served\r\nuser.  This document updates RFC 5502 by defining a new P-Served-User\r\nheader field parameter, \"orig-cdiv\".  The parameter conveys the\r\nsession case used by a proxy when handling an originating session\r\nafter Call Diversion (CDIV) services have been invoked for the served\r\nuser.  This document also fixes the ABNF in RFC 5502 and provides\r\nmore guidance for using the P-Served-User header field in IP\r\nnetworks.","pub_date":"February 2019","keywords":["SIP","RFC5502","P-","3GPP","IMS","Served-User","orig-cdiv"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5502"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8498","errata_url":null}
