This document asks the question of\r\nwhether it is time to either redesign and replace the DNS to match\r\ncontemporary requirements and expectations (rather than continuing to\r\ntry to design and implement incremental patches that are not fully\r\nsatisfactory) or draw some clear lines about functionality that is\r\nnot really needed or that should be performed in some other way.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["domain name","DNS functions","DNS extensions"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8324","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8324"}
