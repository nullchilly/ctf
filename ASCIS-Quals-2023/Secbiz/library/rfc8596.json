This allows SFC packets using the NSH to be forwarded between\r\n   SFFs over an MPLS network, and to select one of multiple SFFs in the\r\n   destination MPLS node.\r\n","pub_date":"June 2019","keywords":["label","label stack","service function forwarder (SFF)"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8596","errata_url":null}
