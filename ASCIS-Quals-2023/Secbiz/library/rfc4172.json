This functionality is provided\r\nthrough TCP protocols for fibre channel frame transport and the\r\ndistributed fabric services specified by the fibre channel\r\nstandards.  The architecture enables internetworking of fibre\r\nchannel devices through gateway-accessed regions with the fault\r\nisolation properties of autonomous systems and the scalability of\r\nthe IP network.
