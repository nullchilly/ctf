It provides an indication of traffic jitter, a\r\nmeasure of deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data loss\r\nat-a-glance measure for a particular flow.  For instance, the MDI\r\nmay be used as a reference in characterizing and comparing networks\r\ncarrying UDP streaming media.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2006","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4445","errata_url":null}
