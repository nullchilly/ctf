The\r\ncomputation is performed by routers participating in the specific\r\nnetwork in a distributed manner using a Flexible Algorithm Definition\r\n(FAD). This definition is provisioned on one or more routers and\r\npropagated through the network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding.\r\n\r\nBorder Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) enables the collection\r\nof various topology information from the network. This document\r\ndefines extensions to the BGP-LS address family to advertise the FAD\r\nas a part of the topology information from the network.","pub_date":"February 2023","keywords":["BGP-LS","Segment Routing","IS-IS","OSPF","OSPFv3"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9351","errata_url":null}
