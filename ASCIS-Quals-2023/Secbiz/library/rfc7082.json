However, it does not define a way for a\r\nclient involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus\r\nsupports CCMP.  This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client\r\nthat joins a conference using SIP to also register for the\r\nCentralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take\r\nadvantage of CCMP operations on the conference.\r\n\r\nThis document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of\r\nthe User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.  The first\r\nmechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism\r\ndefines a new value for the \"purpose\" header field parameter in the\r\n<service-uris> element in the SIP conferencing event package.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7082","errata_url":null}
