These processes include\r\nthe evolution of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related\r\nprotocols, as well as the operation of the DISPATCH and SIPCORE\r\nworking groups.  This document updates RFC 5727 to allow flexibility\r\nfor the area and working group structure, while preserving the SIP\r\nchange processes.  It also generalizes the DISPATCH working group\r\nprocesses so that they can be easily adopted by other working groups.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["dispatch","RAI","ART","sip-change"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5727"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0067"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7957","errata_url":null}
