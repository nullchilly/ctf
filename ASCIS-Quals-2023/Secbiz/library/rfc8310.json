These profiles can\r\nincrease the privacy of DNS transactions compared to using only\r\ncleartext DNS.  This document also specifies new authentication\r\nmechanisms -- it describes several ways that a DNS client can use an\r\nauthentication domain name to authenticate a (D)TLS connection to a\r\nDNS server.  Additionally, it defines (D)TLS protocol profiles for\r\nDNS clients and servers implementing DNS over (D)TLS.
