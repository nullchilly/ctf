This has led to a decline in the moral values within the Internet and attempts to retrofit a suitable moral code to implemented and deployed protocols has been shown to be sub-optimal. \r\n\r\nThis document specifies a requirement for all new Routing Area Internet-Drafts to include a \"Morality Considerations\" section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.
