The\r\nflexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension\r\nto pNFS that allows the use of storage devices that require only a\r\nlimited degree of interaction with the metadata server and use\r\nalready-existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring is also added to\r\nprovide replication of files.\r\n","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8435","errata_url":null}
