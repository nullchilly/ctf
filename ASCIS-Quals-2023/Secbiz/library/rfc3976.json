This document addresses means to support existing IN services from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints for an IP-host-to-phone call.  The call request is originated on a SIP endpoint, but the services to the call are provided by the data and procedures resident in the PSTN\/IN.  To provide IN services in a transparent manner to SIP endpoints, this document describes the mechanism for interworking SIP and Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP).  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
