The new mode is\r\nbased on the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology\r\nand UDP encapsulation of data and signaling traffic. The main\r\ndifference from the previously specified modes is the use of HIP\r\nmessages instead of ICE for all NAT traversal procedures due to the\r\nkernel-space dependencies of HIP.","pub_date":"July 2021","keywords":["HIP","NAT","NAT traversal"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9028","errata_url":null}
