In some use cases, Diameter\r\nnodes need to apply the same operation to a large group of Diameter\r\nsessions concurrently.  The Diameter base protocol commands operate\r\non a single session so these use cases can result in many thousands\r\nof command exchanges enforcing the same operation on each session in\r\nthe group.  In order to reduce signaling, it is desirable to enable\r\nbulk operations on all (or part of) the sessions managed by a\r\nDiameter node using a single or a few command exchanges.  This\r\ndocument specifies the Diameter protocol extensions to achieve this\r\nsignaling optimization.","pub_date":"April 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9390","errata_url":null}
