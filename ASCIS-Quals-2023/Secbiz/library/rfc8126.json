To ensure that the values\r\nin these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote\r\ninteroperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a\r\ncentral record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by\r\nthe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\r\n\r\nTo make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance\r\ndescribing the conditions under which new values should be assigned,\r\nas well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made,\r\nis needed.  This document defines a framework for the documentation\r\nof these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that\r\nthe provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and\r\naddresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a\r\nregistry.\r\n\r\nThis is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":["internet assigned numbers authority","values","implementations","code point","protocol constant","protocol parameter","codepoint"],"obsoletes":["RFC5226"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0026"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8126","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8126"}
