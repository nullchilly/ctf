{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC0984","title":" PCMAIL: A distributed mail system for personal computers ","authors":["D.D. Clark","M.L.

Pcmail is a    distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary    number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers    (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a    single entity called the \"repository\".  The repository is a storage    center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally    from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The    repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The    repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk    storage. It is published for discussion and comment, and does not    constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of    this document is not advised.   See RFC-993.
