The Internet Key\r\nExchange (IKE) protocol is used to negotiate the IPsec Security\r\nAssociation (IPsec SA) parameters, such as which algorithms should be\r\nused.  To ensure interoperability between different implementations,\r\nit is necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation\r\nrequirements and usage guidance to ensure that there is at least one\r\nalgorithm that all implementations support.  This document updates RFC\r\n7296 and obsoletes RFC 4307 in defining the current algorithm\r\nimplementation requirements and usage guidance for IKEv2, and does\r\nminor cleaning up of the IKEv2 IANA registry.  This document does not\r\nupdate the algorithms used for packet encryption using IPsec\r\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP).","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["IPsec","IKE","internet key exchange"],"obsoletes":["RFC4307"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7296"],"updated_by":["RFC9395"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8247","errata_url":null}
