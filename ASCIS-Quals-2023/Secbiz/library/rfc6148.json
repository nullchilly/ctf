This lease information\r\nis used by relay agents for various purposes like antispoofing and\r\nprevention of flooding.  RFC 4388 defines a mechanism for relay\r\nagents to retrieve the lease information from the DHCP server when\r\nthis information is lost.  The existing lease query mechanism is\r\ndata-driven, which means that a relay agent can initiate the lease\r\nquery only when it starts receiving data to and from the clients.  In\r\ncertain scenarios, this model is not scalable.  This document first\r\nlooks at issues in the existing mechanism and then proposes a new\r\nquery type, query by Remote ID, to address these issues.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["[--------]","dynamic host configuration protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4388"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6148","errata_url":null}
