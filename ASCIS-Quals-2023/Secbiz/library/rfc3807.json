This protocol may be used between a Signaling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway controller (MGC).  It is assumed that the SG receives V5.2 signaling over a standard V5.2 interface.  This document builds on the ISDN User Adaptation Layer Protocol (RFC 3057).  It defines all necessary extensions to the IUA Protocol needed for the V5UA protocol implementation.
