In the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's\r\nIPv4 addresses are embedded in the ISP's IPv6 addresses, and the\r\nhosts using these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the\r\nglobal IPv6 Internet directly and can communicate with the global\r\nIPv4 Internet via stateless translators.  The communications can\r\neither be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated.  The IVI mechanism\r\nsupports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental\r\ndeployment.  The IVI is an early design deployed in the CERNET as a\r\nreference for the IETF standard documents on IPv4\/IPv6 stateless\r\ntranslation.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.\r\n","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["Stateless IPv4\/IPv6 translation","IPv4\/IPv6 Header Translation","IPv4-embedded IPv6 Address","IPv4\/IPv6 Multicast Translation","stateless NAT64"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6219","errata_url":null}
