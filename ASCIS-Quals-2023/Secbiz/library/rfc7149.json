And\r\nyet, no clear definition of what SDN actually covers has been broadly\r\nadmitted so far.  This document aims to clarify the SDN landscape by\r\nproviding a perspective on requirements, issues, and other\r\nconsiderations about SDN, as seen from within a service provider\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather\r\nto suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used\r\nunder an SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues\r\nthe combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.  As\r\nsuch, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of\r\nclarification.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["Network Automation","Policy Management","Connectivity Provisioning","Service Parameter Exposure","Dynamic Negotiation","Dynamic Service Provisioning","Autonomic","Programmable Networks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7149","errata_url":null}
