The only addresses belonging to a router that are\r\nadvertised in TE LSAs are the local addresses corresponding to TE-enabled\r\nlinks, and the local address corresponding to the Router ID.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow other routers in a network to compute Multiprotocol\r\nLabel Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE\r\nLSPs) to a given router's local addresses, those addresses must also\r\nbe advertised by OSPF TE.\r\n\r\nThis document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise\r\na router's local addresses.
