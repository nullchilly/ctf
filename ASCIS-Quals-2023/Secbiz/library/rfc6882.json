These VPNs can be operated using BGP\/MPLS,\r\nand a single Provider Edge (PE) node may provide access to multiple\r\ncustomer sites belonging to different VPNs.\r\n\r\nThe VPNs may support a number of customer services, including RSVP and\r\nResource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) traffic.  This\r\ndocument describes how to support RSVP-TE between customer sites when a single\r\nPE supports multiple VPNs and labels are not used to identify VPNs between\r\nPEs.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6882","errata_url":null}
