The lack of an IPv6 Address\r\nSpecific Extended Community may be a problem when an application\r\nuses the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, and one wants to use\r\nthis application in a pure IPv6 environment.  This document defines\r\na new BGP attribute, the IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community, that\r\naddresses this problem.  The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community\r\nis similar to the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, except\r\nthat it carries an IPv6 address rather than an IPv4 address.
