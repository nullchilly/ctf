With regard to URN syntax,\r\nthis document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is\r\nconsistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining\r\nURN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance.  With regard to URN\r\nnamespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN\r\nnamespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it\r\ndescribes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the\r\nInternet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
