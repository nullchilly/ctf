Towards this end, we review the ICN literature\r\nand document scenarios which have been considered in previous\r\nperformance evaluation studies.  We discuss a variety of aspects that\r\nan ICN solution can address.  This includes general aspects, such as,\r\nnetwork efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and\r\nreliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance,\r\nreal-time communication efficiency, energy consumption frugality, and\r\ndisruption and delay tolerance.  We detail ICN-specific aspects as\r\nwell, such as information security and trust, persistence,\r\navailability, provenance, and location independence.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking\r\nResearch Group (ICNRG).\r\n","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7476","errata_url":null}
