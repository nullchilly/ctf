The general approach described here uses a\r\nsingle level of encapsulation and could be used to protect unicast,\r\nmulticast, and LDP traffic against link, router, and shared risk\r\ngroup failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of\r\nthe general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification.\r\nThe document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area\r\nWorking Group at the time of publication and is published as a\r\ndocument of record.  Further work is needed before implementation or\r\ndeployment.","pub_date":"August 2013","keywords":["not-via"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6981","errata_url":null}
