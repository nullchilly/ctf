Currently, the supported information servers are HTTP servers. \r\n\r\n The interface has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) since 1993.  This specification defines the 'current practice' parameters of the 'CGI\/1.1' interface developed and documented at the U.S. National Centre for Supercomputing Applications.  This document also defines the use of the CGI\/1.1 interface on UNIX(R) and other, similar systems.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
