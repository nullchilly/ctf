They are\r\ndesigned to use TCP's ideal vantage point to diagnose performance problems in\r\nboth the network and the application.  If a network-based application is\r\nperforming poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck is in the sender, the\r\nreceiver, or the network itself.  If the bottleneck is in the network, TCP can\r\nprovide specific information about its nature.
