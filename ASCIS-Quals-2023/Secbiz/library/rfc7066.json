Standardization organizations have made the Internet\r\nProtocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications.\r\nHowever, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous\r\nspecifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links\r\nin terms of bandwidth, cost, and delay put special requirements on\r\nhow IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts\r\nthat attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal\r\nMobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System\r\n(EPS) networks (hereafter collectively referred to as Third\r\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) networks).  This document also\r\nlists specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be implemented in\r\naddition to what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node Requirements\r\ndocument (RFC 6434).  It also discusses some issues related to the\r\nuse of these components when operating in these networks.  This\r\ndocument obsoletes RFC 3316.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC3316"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7066","errata_url":null}
