The first header, \"Answer-Mode\",\r\nexpresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface\r\nwaits for user input before accepting the request or, instead,\r\naccepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second\r\nheader, \"Priv-Answer-Mode\", is similar to the first, except that it\r\nrequests administrative-level access and has consequent additional\r\nauthentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have\r\napplicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics\r\nlike loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate\r\nhow the request was handled is also defined.
