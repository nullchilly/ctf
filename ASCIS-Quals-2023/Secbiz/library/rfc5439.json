As providers plan to grow these\r\nnetworks, they need to understand whether existing protocols and\r\nimplementations can support the network sizes that they are planning.\r\n\r\nThis document presents an analysis of some of the scaling concerns\r\nfor the number of Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in MPLS-TE core\r\nnetworks, and examines the value of two techniques (LSP hierarchies\r\nand multipoint-to-point LSPs) for improving scaling.  The intention is\r\nto motivate the development of appropriate deployment techniques and\r\nprotocol extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nThis document only considers the question of achieving scalability\r\nfor the support of point-to-point MPLS-TE LSPs.  Point-to-multipoint\r\nMPLS-TE LSPs are for future study.  This memo provides information \r\nfor the Internet community.
