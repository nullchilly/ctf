It updates specifications for the CCID-3 and CCID-4\r\nCongestion Control IDs of DCCP.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with\r\nTFRC-based DCCP congestion control.  It uses a recommendation made in\r\nthe original TFRC specification to avoid the inherent problems of\r\nreceiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples\r\nalready available at the sender.\r\n\r\nIt is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end\r\nnegotiable extension.
