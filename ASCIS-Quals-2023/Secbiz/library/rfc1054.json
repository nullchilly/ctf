Deering"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"19","pub_status":"UNKNOWN","status":"UNKNOWN","source":"Legacy","abstract":" This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting.  IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a \"host group\", a set hosts identified by a single IP destination address.  A multicast datagram is delivered to all members of its destination host group with the same \"best-efforts\" reliability as regular unicast IP datagrams.  It is proposed as a standard for IP multicasting in the Internet.  This specification is a major revision of RFC-988.
