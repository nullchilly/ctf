The goal of this document is to describe the commonly\r\nprovided functions of SBCs.  A special focus is given to those\r\npractices that are viewed to be in conflict with SIP architectural\r\nprinciples.  This document also explores the underlying requirements\r\nof network operators that have led to the use of these functions and\r\npractices in order to identify protocol requirements and determine\r\nwhether those requirements are satisfied by existing specifications\r\nor if additional standards work is required.
