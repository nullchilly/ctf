Such extensions enable the exchange of\r\nsegments using different source-destination address pairs, resulting\r\nin the capability of using multiple paths in a significant number of\r\nscenarios.  Some level of multihoming and mobility support can be\r\nachieved through these extensions.  However, the support for multiple\r\nIP addresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of\r\nthe resulting MPTCP.  This note includes a threat analysis for MPTCP.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["Multipath TCP","threats","security","MPTCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6181","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6181"}
