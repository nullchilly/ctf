An inter-area Traffic Engineered Label\r\nSwitched Path (TE-LSP) is an LSP that transits through at least two\r\nIGP areas.  In a multi-area network, topology visibility remains local\r\nto a given area, and a head-end Label Switching Router (LSR) cannot\r\ncompute an inter-area shortest constrained path.  One key application\r\nof the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based architecture is the\r\ncomputation of inter-area TE-LSP paths.  The PCE Communication\r\nProtocol (PCECP) is used to communicate computation requests from\r\nPath Computation Clients (PCCs) to PCEs, and to return computed paths\r\nin responses.  This document lists a detailed set of PCECP-specific\r\nrequirements for support of inter-area TE-LSP path computation.  It\r\ncomplements the generic requirements for a PCE Communication\r\nProtocol.
