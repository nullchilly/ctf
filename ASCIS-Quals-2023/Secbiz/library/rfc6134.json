Currently, this requires that all members of\r\nsuch lists be hard-coded in the script itself.  Whenever a member of\r\na list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and\r\npossibly uploaded to a mail server.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally\r\nstored lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the\r\nscript, such as using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\r\n(LDAP), the Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP), vCard\r\nExtensions to WebDAV (CardDAV), or relational databases.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6134","errata_url":null}
