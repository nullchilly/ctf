Operating on the basis of\r\nmultihomed customer edge (CE), redundant PWs, upstream label\r\nassignment, and context-specific label switching, the mechanism\r\nenables local repair to be performed by the router upstream adjacent\r\nto a failure.  The router can restore a PW in the order of tens of\r\nmilliseconds, by rerouting traffic around the failure to a protector\r\nthrough a pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism\r\ncan be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the\r\nfailure and the network converges on the topology changes due to the\r\nfailure.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["pseudowire","PW","protection","local repair","fast reroute"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8104","errata_url":null}
