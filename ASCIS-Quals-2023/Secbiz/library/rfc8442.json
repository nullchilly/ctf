These cipher\r\nsuites are based on the Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with\r\nPre-Shared Key (ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together with the\r\nAuthenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms\r\nAES-GCM and AES-CCM.  PSK provides light and efficient authentication,\r\nECDHE provides forward secrecy, and AES-GCM and AES-CCM provide\r\nencryption and integrity protection.","pub_date":"September 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8442","errata_url":null}
