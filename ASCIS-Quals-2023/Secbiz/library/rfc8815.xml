	IP Multicast has been deployed in various forms, within
	private networks, the wider Internet, and federated networks
        such as national or regional research networks.
        While a number of service models have been published, and in many cases
	revised over time, there has been no strong recommendation
	made by the IETF on the appropriateness of those models to certain scenarios,
        even though vendors and federations have often made such recommendations.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">
	This document addresses this gap by making a BCP-level
	recommendation to deprecate the use of Any-Source Multicast (ASM) 
	for interdomain 
	multicast, leaving Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) 
	as the recommended interdomain mode of
        multicast.  
	Therefore, this document recommends that all hosts and routers that support 
	interdomain multicast applications fully support SSM.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">
	This document does not make any statement on the use of ASM
	within a single domain or organization and, therefore, does not preclude its use. Indeed, there are application contexts for
	which ASM is currently still widely considered well suited within a
	single domain.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">
        The main issue in most cases with moving to SSM is application support.
        Many applications are initially deployed for intradomain use and are later
        deployed interdomain. Therefore, this document recommends that
        applications support SSM, even when they are initially intended for
        intradomain use. As explained below, SSM applications are
        readily compatible with existing intradomain ASM deployments using PIM-SM, as PIM-SSM is merely a subset of PIM-SM.

	  in joining a multicast group address, and routers use multicast 
	  routing protocols to deliver traffic from 
	  the sender(s) to the receivers.  If there are multiple senders 
	  for a given group, traffic from all senders will be delivered

	In enterprise and campus scenarios, ASM in the form of PIM-SM is 
	likely the most commonly deployed 
	multicast protocol.  The configuration and

	domain is a well-understood operational practice.  However, if interworking
	with external PIM domains is needed in IPv4 multicast deployments,
	interdomain MSDP is required to 
	exchange information about sources between domain RPs. 
	Deployment experience has shown MSDP to be a complex and fragile protocol

	making RP discovery automatic for all routers on the path
	between a receiver and a sender.
	Embedded-RP can support lightweight ad hoc deployments.
	However, it relies

	  eliminating the network-based source discovery required in ASM with PIM-SM. 

	  Specifically, SSM eliminates the need for RPs,
	  shared trees, Shortest Path Tree (SPT) switchovers, PIM registers, 
	  MSDP, dynamic RP-discovery mechanisms (Bootstrap Router
	  (BSR) / AutoRP), and data-driven

        If feasible, it is recommended for applications to use SSM even if they
        are initially only meant to be used in intradomain environments supporting ASM. 
	Because PIM-SSM is a subset of PIM-SM, existing intradomain PIM-SM networks
	are automatically compatible with SSM applications. Thus, SSM applications  
	can operate alongside existing ASM applications.
        SSM's benefits of simplified address management and significantly reduced
	operational complexity apply equally to intradomain use.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.5-2">However, for some applications, it may be prohibitively difficult to
        add support for source discovery, so intradomain ASM may still be appropriate.

        <t pn="section-4.6-1">
	In the case of existing ASM applications that cannot readily be ported to SSM,
	it may be possible to use some form of protocol mapping -- i.e., to have a 
	mechanism to translate a (*,G) join or leave to a (S,G) join or leave for 
	a specific source S.  The general challenge in performing such mapping is 
	determining where the configured source address, S, comes from.

        <t pn="section-4.6-2">
	There are existing vendor-specific mechanisms deployed that achieve this function,
	but none are documented in IETF documents.  This may be a useful 
	area for the IETF to work on as an interim
	transition mechanism. However, these mechanisms would introduce additional 
	administrative burdens, along with the need for some form of address management, 
	neither of which are required in SSM.  Hence, this should not be considered a

	A key benefit of SSM is that the receiver specifies the source-group tuple 
	when signaling interest in a multicast stream.  Hence, the group address need 
	not be globally unique, so there is no need for multicast address allocation
	as long the reserved SSM range is used.
        </t>

	Despite the deprecation of interdomain ASM, it is recommended that operators

	The use of ASM within a single multicast domain such as a campus or

        enterprise networks that have successfully been using
        PIM-SM for many years. The operators of such networks most often

        <t pn="section-4.9-1">
	 Existing PIM-SM deployments can usually be used to run SSM
	applications with few-to-no changes.  In some widely available
	router implementations of PIM-SM, PIM-SSM is simply enabled by default
	in the designated SSM address spaces whenever PIM-SM is
	enabled.  In other implementations, simple configuration options
	exist to enable it.  This allows migration of ASM applications
	to SSM/PIM-SSM solely through application-side development
	to handle source-signaling via
	IGMPv3/MLDv2 and using SSM addresses.  No network actions are
	required for this transition; unchanged ASM applications can
	continue to coexist without issues.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.9-2">When running PIM-SM, IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership reports may also result in
        the desired PIM-SSM (S,G) operations and bypass any RP procedures. This is not
        standardized but depends on implementation and may require additional configuration
        in available products.  In general, it is recommended to always use SSM address space
        for SSM applications. For example, the interaction of IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership
        reports and BIDIR-PIM is undefined and may not result in forwarding of any traffic.

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes the Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), a protocol for inter-domain multicast routing.  BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, and optionally allows receiver domains to build source-specific, inter-domain, distribution branches where needed.  BGMP natively supports "source-specific multicast" (SSM).  To also support "any-source multicast" (ASM), BGMP requires that each multicast group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root domain).  It requires that different ranges of the multicast address space are associated (e.g., with Unicast-Prefix-Based Multicast addressing) with different domains.  Each of these domains then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees for all groups in its range.  Multicast participants will generally receive better multicast service if the session initiator's address allocator selects addresses from its own domain's part of the space, thereby causing the root domain to be local to at least one of the session participants.

            <abstract>
              <t>The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols that allow a host to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to receive IPv4 and IPv6 multicast transmissions, respectively. Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast transmission.  This document defines the notion of an "SSM-aware" router and host, and clarifies and (in some cases) modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on SSM-aware routers and hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast.  This document updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
