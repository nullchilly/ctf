This memo describes the\r\nInternationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation\r\n(\"I-DUNNO\"), a notation designed to replace current textual\r\nrepresentations of IP addresses with something that is not only more\r\nconcise but will also discourage this small, but obviously important,\r\nsubset of human activity.","pub_date":"1 April 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8771","errata_url":null}
