This is in contrast to the Internet's \"best-effort\" or \"normal Internet traffic\" model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a \"lower\" priority than the normal \"best-effort\" Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called \"Lower Effort\" (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on \"best-effort\"\/\"normal\" or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic.
