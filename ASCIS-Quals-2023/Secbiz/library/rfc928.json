{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC0928","title":" Introduction to proposed DoD standard H-FP ","authors":["M.A. Padlipsky"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"21","pub_status":"UNKNOWN","status":"UNKNOWN","source":"Legacy","abstract":"    The broad outline of the Host-Front End Protocol introduced here and    described in RFC-929 is the result of the deliberations of a number of    experienced H-FP designers, who sat as a committee of the DoD Protocol    Standards Technical Panel.  It is the intent of the designers that the    protocol be subjected to multiple test implementations and probable    iteration before being agreed upon as any sort of \"standard\".    Therefore, the first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A    PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to    request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test    implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the    author.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
