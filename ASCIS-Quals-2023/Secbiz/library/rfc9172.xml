      This document defines security features for the Bundle Protocol

      in Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) to provide security 
      services between a security source and a security acceptor. When the

      The Bundle Protocol specification <xref target="RFC9171" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9171"/> 
      defines DTN as referring to "a network architecture providing 
      communications in and/or through highly stressed environments" 
      where "BP may be viewed as sitting at the application layer of some 
      number of constituent networks, forming a store-carry-forward 
      overlay network". The phrase "stressed environment" refers to multiple 
      challenging conditions including intermittent connectivity, large 
      and/or variable delays, asymmetric data rates, and high bit error 
      rates.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
   It should be presumed that the BP will be deployed in an untrusted 
   network, which poses the usual security challenges
   related to confidentiality and integrity. However, the stressed nature of the BP
      operating environment imposes unique conditions where usual transport 
      security mechanisms may not be sufficient. For example, the 
      store-carry-forward nature of the network may require protecting 
      data at rest, preventing unauthorized consumption of critical 
      resources such as storage space, and operating without regular 
      contact with a centralized security oracle (such as a certificate 
      authority).

         BPSec addresses only the security of data traveling over the

         protocol can provide security-at-rest in a store-carry-forward
         network, it does not address threats that share computing resources 
         with the DTN and/or BPSec software implementations.  These threats 
         may be malicious software or compromised libraries that intend 
         to intercept data or recover cryptographic material. Here, it is 
         the responsibility of the BPSec implementer to ensure that any 
         cryptographic material, including shared secrets or private keys, 
         is protected against access within both memory and storage devices.

         Completely trusted networks are extremely uncommon. Among

   Mandating a single security context, which is a set of assumptions, 
   algorithms, configurations, and policies used to implement security 
   services, may result in too much security for some networks and too 
   little security in others. Default security contexts are

   interoperability testing and for operational use on the terrestrial

         The Bundle Protocol allows extension blocks to be added to a bundle

         recommended that solutions such as bundle encapsulation be
         used to ensure that a bundle be delivered to a security acceptor
         prior to being delivered to the bundle destination. Generally,
         if a bundle reaches a waypoint that has the appropriate configuration

         represented once in the security block; the information that is 
         different (e.g., the security targets) is represented individually.

         If a node processes any security operation in a security block, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that it process all
         security operations in the security block. This allows
         security sources to assert that the set of security
         operations in a security block are expected to be processed
         by the same security acceptor. However, the determination of
         whether a node actually is a security acceptor or not is a
         matter of the policy of the node itself. In cases where a
         receiving node determines that it is the security acceptor of
         only a subset of the security operations in a security block,
         the node may choose to only process that subset of security
         operations.

                  bundle with the security targets being the second extension
                  block (B5) and the payload (B6) as well as the newly created
                  BIB holding their plaintext integrity signatures (B7). A 
                  single new BCB is used in this case because all three 
                  targets share a security source, security context, and 
                  security context parameters. Had this not been the case, 
                  multiple BCBs could have been added instead.

            When evaluating the risk of eavesdropping attacks, it is

            Depending on the network, bundles may persist for days or
            even years.  Long-lived bundles imply that the data exists
            in the network for a longer period of time and, thus,
            there may be more opportunities to capture those
            bundles. Additionally, the implication is that long-lived bundles store information within that remains relevant and sensitive for long enough that, once
            captured, there is sufficient time to crack encryption
            associated with the bundle. If a bundle does persist on
            the network for years and the cipher suite used for a BCB

            recover the protected data either before that bundle

            generate the BIB (e.g., K<sub>A</sub>). If both of these conditions

            Since BPSec security operations are implemented by placing
            blocks in a bundle, there is no in-band mechanism for
            detecting or correcting certain cases where Olive removes
            blocks from a bundle. If Olive removes a BCB, but keeps
            the security target, the security target remains encrypted
            and there is a possibility that there may no longer be
            sufficient information to decrypt the block at its
            destination.  If Olive removes both a BCB (or BIB) and its
            security target, there is no evidence left in the bundle of
            the security operation. Similarly, if Olive removes the
            BIB, but not the security target, there is no evidence left
            in the bundle of the security operation.  In each of these
            cases, the implementation of BPSec must be combined with
            policy configuration at endpoints in the network that
            describe the expected and required security operations
            that must be applied on transmission and that are expected to
            be present on receipt.  This or other similar out-of-band
            information is required to correct for removal of security

            If Olive is a legitimate node within the delay-tolerant network, the BIB
            generated by Alice with K<sub>A</sub> can be replaced with a new BIB
            generated with K<sub>M</sub> and forwarded to Bob.  If Bob is only
            validating that the BIB was generated by a legitimate
            user, Bob will acknowledge the message as originating from
            Olive instead of Alice. Validating a BIB indicates only
            that the BIB was generated by a holder of the relevant
            key; it does not provide any guarantee that the bundle or
            block was created by the same entity. In order to provide
            verifiable integrity checks, the BCB should require an
            encryption scheme that is Indistinguishable under adaptive
            Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA2) secure. Such an
            encryption scheme will guard against signature
            substitution attempts by Olive. In this case, Alice

            Olive is also able to generate new bundles and transmit
            them into the delay-tolerant network at will.
	    These bundles may be either 1)
            copies or slight modifications of previously observed
            bundles (i.e., a replay attack) or 2) entirely new bundles
            generated based on the Bundle Protocol, BPSec, or other
            bundle-related protocols.  With these attacks, Olive's
            objectives may vary, but may be targeting either the
            Bundle Protocol or application-layer protocols conveyed by
            the Bundle Protocol. The target could also be the storage
            and computing capabilities of the nodes running the bundle or
            application-layer protocols (e.g., a denial of service to
            flood on the storage of the store-and-forward mechanism or
            a computation that would process the bundles and perhaps
            prevent other activities).

            BPSec relies on cipher suite capabilities to prevent
            replay or forged message attacks.  A BCB used with
            appropriate cryptographic mechanisms may provide replay
            protection under certain circumstances.  Alternatively,
            application data itself may be augmented to include
            mechanisms to assert data uniqueness and then be protected
            with a BIB, a BCB, or both along with other block data. In
            such a case, the receiving node would be able to validate
            the uniqueness of the data.

            For example, a BIB may be used to validate the integrity
            of a bundle's primary block, which includes a timestamp
            and lifetime for the bundle. If a bundle is replayed
            outside of its lifetime, then the replay attack will fail
            as the bundle will be discarded. Similarly, additional
            blocks, such as the Bundle Age, may be signed and validated
            to identify replay attacks. Finally, security context
            parameters within BIBs and BCBs may include
            anti-replay mechanisms such as session identifiers,
            nonces, and dynamic passwords as supported by network
            characteristics.

         functions in their network. For example, a default set of
         security contexts could be created for use over the

This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of the networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation for the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues.  This document represents the consensus of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
              <t indent="0">To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t>
              <t indent="0">This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</t>
