MRCPv2 is not a \"stand-alone\" protocol -- it relies on\r\nother protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to\r\ncoordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between\r\nthem, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe,\r\ndiscover, and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP\r\nto establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the\r\nmedia source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the\r\nMRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above,\r\nallowing the client to control the media processing resources on the\r\nspeech resource server.
