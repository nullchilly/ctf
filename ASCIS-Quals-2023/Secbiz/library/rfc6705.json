PMIPv6 requires all\r\ncommunications to go through the local mobility anchor.  As this can\r\nbe suboptimal, Localized Routing (LR) allows Mobile Nodes (MNs) attached to\r\nthe same or different Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) to route traffic by\r\nusing localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.\r\nThis document proposes initiation, utilization, and termination\r\nmechanisms for localized routing between mobile access gateways\r\nwithin a proxy mobile IPv6 domain.  It defines two new signaling\r\nmessages, Localized Routing Initiation (LRI) and Local Routing\r\nAcknowledgment (LRA), that are used to realize this mechanism.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"September 2012","keywords":["[--------]","PMIPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6705","errata_url":null}
