The bandwidth of such links may change\r\ndiscretely in response to a changing external environment.  The word\r\n\"availability\" is typically used to describe such links during network\r\nplanning.  This document defines a new type of Generalized Switching\r\nCapability-Specific Information (SCSI) TLV to extend the Generalized\r\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)\r\nrouting protocol.  The extension can be used for route computation in\r\na network that contains links with variable discrete bandwidth.\r\nNote that this document only covers the mechanisms by which the\r\navailability information is distributed.  The mechanisms by which\r\navailability information of a link is determined and the use of the\r\ndistributed information for route computation are outside the scope\r\nof this document.  It is intended that technology-specific documents\r\nwill reference this document to describe specific uses.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["microwave","copper","Generalized SCSI-TLV"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8330","errata_url":null}
