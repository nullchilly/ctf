This is a robust method for Path MTU Discovery\r\n(PMTUD) for datagram Packetization Layers (PLs). It allows a PL, or a\r\ndatagram application that uses a PL, to discover whether a network\r\npath can support the current size of datagram.  This can be used to\r\ndetect and reduce the message size when a sender encounters a packet\r\nblack hole. It can also probe a network path to discover whether the\r\nmaximum packet size can be increased.  This provides functionality\r\nfor datagram transports that is equivalent to the PLPMTUD\r\nspecification for TCP, specified in RFC 4821, which it updates. It\r\nalso updates the UDP Usage Guidelines to refer to this method for use\r\nwith UDP datagrams and updates SCTP.\r\n\r\nThe document provides implementation notes for incorporating Datagram\r\nPMTUD into IETF datagram transports or applications that use datagram\r\ntransports.\r\n\r\nThis specification updates RFC 4960, RFC 4821, RFC 6951, RFC 8085,\r\nand RFC 8261.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["UDP","SCTP","Transport","PMTUD","PLPMTUD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4821","RFC4960","RFC6951","RFC8085","RFC8261"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8899","errata_url":null}
