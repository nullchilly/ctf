This optional capability allows\r\ntagging and grouping of the nodes in an IS-IS domain.  The node\r\nadministrative tags can be used to express and apply locally defined\r\nnetwork policies, thereby providing a very useful operational\r\ncapability.  Node administrative tags may be used by either IS-IS\r\nitself or other applications consuming information propagated via\r\nIS-IS.","pub_date":"July 2016","keywords":["IGP","IS-IS","Admin-Tag","Traffic Engineering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7917","errata_url":null}
