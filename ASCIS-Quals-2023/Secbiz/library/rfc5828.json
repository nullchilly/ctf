As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding\r\ninto \"transport networks\" that previously were the domain of other\r\ntechnologies such as\r\nSynchronous Optical Network (SONET) \/ Synchronous Digital Hierarchy\r\n(SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode\r\n(ATM).  This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized-\r\nMPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this \"transport network\" capacity.  \r\nGMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies.  Some additional\r\nextensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document\r\nprovides a framework for these extensions.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["[--------]","transport networks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5828","errata_url":null}
