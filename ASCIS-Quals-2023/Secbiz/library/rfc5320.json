These virtual topologies may span\r\nmultiple IP and\/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, and can introduce\r\nfailure modes due to packet duplication and\/or links with diverse\r\nMaximum Transmission Units (MTUs).  This document specifies a\r\nSubnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that\r\naccommodates such virtual topologies over diverse underlying link\r\ntechnologies.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["virtual topologies","mtu","maximum transmission units"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5320","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5320"}
