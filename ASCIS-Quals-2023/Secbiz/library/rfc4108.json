CMS is specified in RFC 3852.  A\r\ndigital signature is used to protect the firmware package from\r\nundetected modification and to provide data origin authentication.\r\nEncryption is optionally used to protect the firmware package from\r\ndisclosure, and compression is optionally used to reduce the size of\r\nthe protected firmware package.  A firmware package loading receipt\r\ncan optionally be generated to acknowledge the successful loading of a\r\nfirmware package.  Similarly, a firmware package load error report can\r\noptionally be generated to convey the failure to load a firmware\r\npackage.
