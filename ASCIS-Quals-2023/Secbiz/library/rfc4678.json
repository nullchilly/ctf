Workload management systems traditionally know a great deal\r\nabout the health of applications, but have little control over the\r\nrate in which these applications receive work.  The Server\/Application\r\nState Protocol (SASP)\r\nprovides a mechanism for load balancers and workload management\r\nsystems to communicate better ways of distributing the existing\r\nworkload to the group members.
