The CA interprets using\r\nsign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.\r\n Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency,\r\ntermed a \"provider\" in this document.  The provider also provides a\r\nvideo service that allows users to connect video devices to their\r\nservice and subsequently to CAs and other sign language speakers. It\r\nis desirable that the videophones used by the sign language speaker\r\nconform to a standard so that any device may be used with any\r\nprovider and that direct video calls between sign language speakers\r\nwork.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and\r\na provider.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["rue","relay user equipment"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9248","errata_url":null}
