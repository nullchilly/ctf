This document defines the\r\nsyntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity\r\nsubmitted by the client during network authentication.  \"Roaming\" may\r\nbe loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet\r\nService Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, \\%customer-vendor\r\nrelationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities\r\nmight be required include ISP \"confederations\" and \\%ISP-provided\r\ncorporate network access support.  This document is a revised version\r\nof RFC 2486, which originally defined NAIs.  Enhancements include\r\ninternational character set and privacy support, as well as a number\r\nof corrections to the original RFC.
