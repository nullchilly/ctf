Since communication\r\nacross interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this\r\nsort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting\r\n\"long-haul\" reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has\r\napplications in other environments as well.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research\r\nGroup and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its\r\npublication as an RFC were raised.  This memo defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","ltp","round-trip times","rtt","long-haul"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5326","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5326"}
