In this memo we\r\nwill describe a class of BGP configurations for which there is more\r\nthan one potential outcome, and where forwarding states other than\r\nthe intended state are equally stable.  Also, the stable state where\r\nBGP converges may be selected by BGP in a non-deterministic manner.\r\nThese stable, but unintended, BGP states are termed here \"BGP\r\nWedgies\".
