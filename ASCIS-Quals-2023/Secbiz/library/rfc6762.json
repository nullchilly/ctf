In particular, the ability\r\nto look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited\r\nto, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server\r\nis useful.\r\n\r\nMulticast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like\r\noperations on the local link in the absence of any conventional\r\nUnicast DNS server.  In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS\r\nnamespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any\r\nannual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise\r\nconfigure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.\r\n\r\nThe primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little\r\nor no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work\r\nwhen no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during\r\ninfrastructure failures.","pub_date":"February 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6762","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6762"}
