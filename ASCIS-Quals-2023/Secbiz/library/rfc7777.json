This allows simplification, ease of\r\nmanagement and control over route and path selection based on\r\nconfigured policies.  This document describes an extension to the\r\nOSPF protocol to advertise node administrative tags.  The node tags\r\ncan be used to express and apply locally defined network policies,\r\nwhich are a very useful operational capability.  Node tags may be\r\nused by either OSPF itself or other applications consuming\r\ninformation propagated via OSPF.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate node\r\nadministrative tags to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.  It provides\r\nexample use cases of administrative node tags.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["open shortest path first"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7777","errata_url":null}
