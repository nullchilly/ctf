The solution's distinctive properties are\r\nthat TCP\/UDP IPv4 packets are valid TCP\/UDP IPv6 packets during\r\ndomain traversal and that IPv4 fragmentation rules are fully\r\npreserved end to end.  Each customer can be assigned one public IPv4\r\naddress, several public IPv4 addresses, or a shared address with a\r\nrestricted port set.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["Coexistence","Transition","Interworking","Tunneling","Stateless","4rd","IPv4","IPv6","Mapping","Global Addressing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7600","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7600"}
