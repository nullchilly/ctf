This document specifies a quick\r\nfailover algorithm and introduces the SCTP Potentially Failed\r\n(SCTP-PF) destination state in SCTP Path Management.\r\n\r\nThis document also specifies a dormant state operation of SCTP that\r\nis required to be followed by an SCTP-PF implementation, but it may\r\nequally well be applied by a standard SCTP implementation, as\r\ndescribed in RFC 4960.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this document introduces an alternative switchback\r\noperation mode called \"Primary Path Switchover\" that will be\r\nbeneficial in certain situations.  This mode of operation applies to\r\nboth a standard SCTP implementation and an SCTP-PF implementation.\r\n\r\nThe procedures defined in the document require only minimal\r\nmodifications to the specification in RFC 4960.  The procedures are\r\nsender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.","pub_date":"April 2016","keywords":["SCTP","Failover","multipath","multihoming","Potentially Failed"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7829","errata_url":null}
