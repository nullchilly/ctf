Support for these methods and settings require\r\nminimal changes to existing stacks. This document also describes\r\nlimitations associated with using these methods. Optimizations and\r\nusage of IPv6 over more complex scenarios are not covered in this\r\nspecification and are a subject for future work.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["IPv6 over 802.11p","OCB","IPv6 over 802.11-OCB"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8691","errata_url":null}
