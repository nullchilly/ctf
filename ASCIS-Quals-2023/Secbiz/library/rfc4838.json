This\r\ndocument describes an architecture that addresses a variety of\r\nproblems with internetworks having operational and performance\r\ncharacteristics that make conventional (Internet-like) networking\r\napproaches either unworkable or impractical.  We define a message-\r\noriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers of\r\nthe networks it interconnects.  The document presents a motivation\r\nfor the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state\r\nmanagement required for its operation, and a discussion of\r\napplication design issues.  This document represents the consensus of\r\nthe IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2007","keywords":["disruption tolerant","irtf","interplanetary internet"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4838","errata_url":null}
