The performance improvement is obtained by relaxing the\r\nIPv6 UDP checksum requirement for tunnel protocols whose header\r\ninformation is protected on the \"inner\" packet being carried.\r\nRelaxing this requirement removes the overhead associated with the\r\ncomputation of UDP checksums on IPv6 packets that carry the tunnel\r\nprotocol packets.  This specification describes how the IPv6 UDP\r\nchecksum requirement can be relaxed when the encapsulated packet\r\nitself contains a checksum.  It also describes the limitations and\r\nrisks of this approach and discusses the restrictions on the use of\r\nthis method.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":["Tunnel","Encapsulation","Integrity","Packet Corruption","Middlebox"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2460"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6935","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6935"}
