It provides technology-independent RPC operations for OAM\r\nprotocols that use connectionless communication.  The retrieval\r\nmethods model herein presented can be extended to include technology-\r\nspecific details.  There are two key benefits of this approach:\r\nFirst, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols.  Second, it\r\nsupports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at\r\ndifferent or the same levels through a unified interface) as well as\r\ninteractive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same\r\nlevels through a unified interface).","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":["CL OAM Retrieval Methods "],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8533","errata_url":null}
