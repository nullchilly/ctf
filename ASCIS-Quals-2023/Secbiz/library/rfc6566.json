When such alterations result in signal degradation,\r\nthese processes are usually referred to as \"impairments\".  These\r\nphysical characteristics may be important constraints to consider\r\nwhen using a GMPLS control plane to support path setup and\r\nmaintenance in wavelength switched optical networks.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a framework for applying GMPLS protocols and\r\nthe Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to support\r\nImpairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength\r\nswitched optical networks.  Specifically, this document discusses key\r\ncomputing constraints, scenarios, and architectural processes: routing,\r\nwavelength assignment, and impairment validation.  This document does\r\nnot define optical data plane aspects; impairment parameters; or\r\nmeasurement of, or assessment and qualification of, a route;\r\nrather, it describes the architectural and information components for\r\nprotocol solutions.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6566","errata_url":null}
