This project has extended the current and\r\ncompleted work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the\r\nIETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking\r\nMethodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory\r\ncharacterization of dedicated physical implementations of\r\ninternetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the\r\nadditional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on\r\ngeneral-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also\r\ninfluenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the\r\n\"telco\" infrastructure.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8204","errata_url":null}
