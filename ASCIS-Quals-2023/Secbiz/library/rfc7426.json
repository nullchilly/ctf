SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks\r\nthrough the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding\r\nplane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This\r\nseparation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as\r\nexperience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion\r\nas to what exactly SDN is, what the layer structure is in an SDN\r\narchitecture, and how layers interface with each other.  This\r\ndocument, a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research\r\nGroup (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise\r\nreference for the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed\r\nliterature, the RFC series, and relevant documents by other\r\nstandards organizations.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":["Software-defined Networking","SDN","Programmable Networks","Architecture","Layer","Terminology"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7426","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7426"}
