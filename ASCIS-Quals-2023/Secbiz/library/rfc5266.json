Secure\r\nconnectivity is required when the user connects to the enterprise\r\nfrom an untrusted network.  Mobility is beneficial when the user\r\nmoves, either inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires\r\na new IP address.  This document describes a solution using Mobile\r\nIPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide\r\nsecure connectivity and mobility.
