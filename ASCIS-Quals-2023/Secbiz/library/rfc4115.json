This marker can be used for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2 VPN services.  The marker defined here is different from previously defined markers in the handling of the in-profile traffic.\r\nFurthermore, this marker doesn't impose peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.
