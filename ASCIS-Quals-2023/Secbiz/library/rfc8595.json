That is,\r\nthe NSH is not used, but the fields of the NSH are mapped to fields\r\nin the MPLS label stack.  This approach does not deprecate or replace\r\nthe NSH, but it acknowledges that there may be a need for an interim\r\ndeployment of SFC functionality in brownfield networks.","pub_date":"June 2019","keywords":["SFC","MPLS","Service Function Chaining","NSH","Network Service Header","MPLS","Multiprotocol Label Switching"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8595","errata_url":null}
