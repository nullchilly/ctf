      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This document describes the lessons that IETF participants have learned (and learned the hard way) about Path Aware networking over a period of several decades. It also provides an analysis of reasons why various Path Aware techniques have seen limited or no deployment.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">This document represents the consensus of the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG).</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-1">One of the first questions reviewers of this document have asked is "What's the definition of a Path, and what's the definition of Path Awareness?" That is not an easy question to answer for this document.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">These terms have definitions in other PANRG documents <xref target="PANRG" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PANRG"/> and are still the subject of some discussion in the Research Group, as of the date of this document. But because this document reflects work performed over several decades, the technologies described in <xref target="Contributions" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/> significantly predate the current definitions of "Path" and "Path Aware" in use in the Path Aware Networking Research Group, and it is unlikely that all the contributors to <xref target="Contributions" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/> would have had the same understanding of these terms. Those technologies were considered "Path Aware" in early PANRG discussions and so are included in this retrospective document.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-3">It is worth noting that the definitions of "Path" and "Path Aware" in <xref target="I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PANRG-PATH-PROPERTIES"/> would apply to Path Aware techniques at a number of levels of the Internet protocol architecture (<xref target="RFC1122" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1122"/>, plus several decades of refinements), but the contributions received for this document tended to target the transport layer and to treat a "Path" constructed by routers as opaque. It would be useful to consider how applicable the Lessons Learned cataloged in this document are, at other layers, and that would be a fine topic for follow-on research.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-4">The current definition of "Path" in the Path Aware Networking Research Group appears in Section 2 ("Terminology") in <xref target="I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PANRG-PATH-PROPERTIES"/>. That definition is included here as a convenience to the reader.</t>
        <blockquote pn="section-1.1-5">
   Path:  A sequence of adjacent path elements over which a packet can
      be transmitted, starting and ending with a node.  A path is
      unidirectional.  Paths are time-dependent, i.e., the sequence of
      path elements over which packets are sent from one node to another
      may change.  A path is defined between two nodes.  For multicast
      or broadcast, a packet may be sent by one node and received by
      multiple nodes.  In this case, the packet is sent over multiple
      paths at once, one path for each combination of sending and
      receiving node; these paths do not have to be disjoint.  Note that
      an entity may have only partial visibility of the path elements
      that comprise a path and visibility may change over time.
      Different entities may have different visibility of a path and/or
      treat path elements at different levels of abstraction.

        <blockquote pn="section-1.1-7">
          <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-7.1">For purposes of this document, "path aware networking" describes
   endpoint discovery of the properties of paths they use for
   communication across an internetwork, and endpoint reaction to these
   properties that affects routing and/or data transfer.  Note that this
   can and already does happen to some extent in the current Internet
   architecture; this definition expands current techniques of path
   discovery and manipulation to cross administrative domain boundaries
   and up to the transport and application layers at the endpoints.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-7.2">Expanding on this definition, a "path aware internetwork" is one in
   which endpoint discovery of path properties and endpoint selection of
   paths used by traffic exchanged by the endpoint are explicitly
   supported, regardless of the specific design of the protocol features
   which enable this discovery and selection.</t>

          <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-5-2.2.2">
            <li pn="section-5-2.2.2.1">We have gained a lot of experience with application-based adaptation since the days where applications just injected traffic inelastically into the network. Such adaptations seem to work well enough that admission control is of less value to these applications.</li>
            <li pn="section-5-2.2.2.2">There are end-to-end measurement techniques that can steer traffic at the application layer (Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), multi-CDNs like Conviva <xref target="Conviva" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Conviva"/>, etc.).</li>
            <li pn="section-5-2.2.2.3">We noted in <xref target="ProtocolStackSupport" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.12"/> that applications often don't know how to utilize Path Aware techniques. This includes not knowing enough about their admission control threshold to be able to ask accurately for the resources they need, whether this is because the application itself doesn't know or because the application has no way to signal its expectations to the underlying protocol stack. To date, attempts to help them haven't gotten anywhere (e.g., the multiple-TSPEC (Traffic Specification) additions to RSVP to attempt to mirror codec selection by applications <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-intserv-multiple-tspec" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="INTSERV-MULTIPLE-TSPEC"/> expired in 2013).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li pn="section-5-2.3">We note that this work took the then-current IP network architecture as given, at least at the time each technique was proposed. It might be useful to consider aspects of the now-current IP network architecture that ease, or impede, Path Aware techniques. For example, there is limited ability in IP to constrain bidirectional paths to be symmetric, and information-centric networking protocols such as Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) <xref target="RFC8793" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8793"/> must force bidirectional path symmetry using protocol-specific mechanisms.</li>

Without information about the path, a sender cannot easily determine an appropriate initial sending rate. The default TCP congestion control therefore uses the safe but time-consuming slow-start algorithm <xref target="RFC5681" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5681"/>. With Quick-Start, connections are allowed to use higher initial sending rates if there is significant unused bandwidth along the path and if the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the request.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-4">By examining the Time To Live (TTL) field in Quick-Start packets, a sender can determine if  routers on the path have approved the Quick-Start request.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-5">The protocol also includes a nonce that provides protection against cheating routers and receivers. If the Quick-Start request is explicitly approved by all routers along the path, the TCP host can send at up to the approved rate; otherwise, TCP would use the default congestion control. Quick-Start requires modifications in the involved end systems as well as in routers.

            <li pn="section-6.3.1-2.1">Having information from the routers along the path can reduce the risk of congestion but cannot avoid it entirely. Determining whether there is unused capacity is not trivial in actual router and host implementations. Data about available capacity visible at the IP layer may be imprecise, and due to the propagation delay, information can already be outdated when it reaches a sender. There is a trade-off between the speedup of data transfers and the risk of congestion even with Quick-Start. This could be mitigated by only allowing Quick-Start to access a proportion of the unused capacity along a path.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.3.1-2.2">For scalable router fast-path implementations, it is important to enable parallel processing of packets, as this is a widely used method, e.g., in network processors. One challenge is synchronization of information between packets that are processed in parallel, which should be avoided as much as possible.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.3.1-2.3">Only some types of application traffic can benefit from Quick-Start. Capacity needs to be requested and discovered. The discovered capacity needs to be utilized by the flow, or it implicitly becomes available for other flows.  Failing to use the requested capacity may have already reduced the pool of Quick-Start capacity that was made available to other competing Quick-Start requests. The benefit is greatest when  senders use this only for bulk flows and avoid sending unnecessary Quick-Start requests, e.g., for flows that only send a small amount of data. Choosing an appropriate request size requires application-internal knowledge that is not commonly expressed by the transport API. How a sender can determine the rate for an initial Quick-Start request is still a largely unsolved problem.</li>

Despite being a very lightweight protocol, Quick-Start suffers from poor incremental deployment properties regarding both a) the required modifications in network infrastructure and b) its interactions with applications. Except for corner cases, congestion control can be quite efficiently performed end to end in the Internet, and in modern stacks there is not much room for significant improvement by additional network support.</t>

This alternative "IW10" approach can also ramp up data transfers faster than the standard congestion control, but it only requires sender-side modifications. As a result, this approach can be easier and incrementally deployed in the Internet. While theoretically Quick-Start can outperform "IW10", the improvement in completion time for data transfer times can, in many cases, be small.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.4.2-3">Second, while the message did provide additional information, the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanism <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/> provided a more robust and informative signal for network nodes to provide early indication that a path has become congested.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.4.2-4">The mechanism originated at a time when the Internet trust model was very different. Most endpoint implementations did not attempt to verify that the message originated from an on-path node before they utilized the message. This made it vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.  In theory, routers might have chosen to use the quoted packet contained in the ICMP payload to validate that the message originated from an on-path node, but this would have increased per-packet processing overhead for each router along the path and would have required transport functionality in the router to verify whether the quoted packet header corresponded to a packet the router had sent.

noted ICMPv6-based attacks on hosts that would also have threatened routers processing ICMPv6 Source Quench payloads.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5-3">TCP <xref target="RFC0793" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC0793"/> has a well-known weakness -- the end-to-end flow control mechanism has only a single signal, the loss of a segment,
detected when no acknowledgment for the lost segment is received at the sender.  There are multiple reasons why the sender might not have received an acknowledgment for the segment.  To name several, the segment could have been trapped in a routing loop, damaged in transmission and failed checksum verification at the
receiver, or lost because some intermediate device discarded the packet, or any of a variety of other things could have happened to the acknowledgment on the way back from the receiver to the sender. TCP implementations since the late 1980s have made the "safe" decision and have interpreted the loss of a segment as evidence
that the path between two endpoints may have become congested enough to exhaust buffers on intermediate hops, so that the TCP sender should "back off" -- reduce its sending rate until it knows that its segments are now being delivered without loss

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5-4">The thinking behind TRIGTRAN was that if a path completely stopped working because a link along the path was "down", somehow something along the path could signal TCP when that link returned to service, and the sending TCP could retry immediately, without waiting for a full retransmission timeout (RTO) period.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-1">The early dreams for TRIGTRAN were dashed because of an assumption that TRIGTRAN triggers would be unauthenticated. This meant that any "safe" TRIGTRAN mechanism would have relied on a mechanism such as setting the IPv4 TTL or IPv6 Hop Count to 255 at a sender and testing that it was 254 upon receipt, so that a receiver could verify that a signal was generated by an adjacent sender known to be on the path being used and not some unknown sender that might not even be on the path (e.g., 
"<xref target="RFC5082" format="title" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)"/>" <xref target="RFC5082" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5082"/>). This situation is very similar to the case for ICMP Source Quench messages as described in <xref target="Source-Quench" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.4"/>, which were also unauthenticated and could be sent by an off-path attacker, resulting in deprecation of ICMP Source Quench message processing <xref target="RFC6633" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6633"/>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-2">TRIGTRAN's scope shrunk from "the path is down" to "the first-hop link is down."</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-3">But things got worse.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-4">Because TRIGTRAN triggers would only be provided when the first-hop link was "down", TRIGTRAN triggers couldn't replace normal TCP retransmission behavior if the path failed because some link further along the network path was "down". So TRIGTRAN triggers added complexity to an already-complex TCP state machine and did not allow any existing complexity to be removed.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-5">There was also an issue that the TRIGTRAN signal was not sent in response to a specific host that had been sending packets and was instead a signal that stimulated a response by any sender on the link. This needs to scale when there are multiple flows trying to use the same resource, yet the sender of a trigger has no understanding of how many of the potential traffic sources will respond by sending packets -- if recipients of the signal "back off" their responses to a trigger to improve scaling, then that immediately mitigates the benefit of the signal.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-6">Finally, intermediate forwarding nodes required modification to provide TRIGTRAN triggers, but operators couldn't charge for TRIGTRAN triggers, so there was no way to recover the cost of modifying, testing, and deploying updated intermediate nodes.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.1-7">Two TRIGTRAN BOFs were held, at IETF 55 <xref target="TRIGTRAN-55" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TRIGTRAN-55"/> and IETF 56 <xref target="TRIGTRAN-56" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TRIGTRAN-56"/>, but this work was not chartered, and there was no interest in deploying TRIGTRAN unless it was chartered and standardized in the IETF.</t>

          <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-6.5.2-2">
            <li pn="section-6.5.2-2.1">TRIGTRAN started with a plausible value proposition, but networking realities in the early 2000s forced reductions in scope that led directly to reductions in potential benefits but no corresponding reductions in costs and complexity.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.5.2-2.2">These reductions in scope were the direct result of an inability for hosts to trust or authenticate TRIGTRAN signals they received from the network.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.5.2-2.3">Operators did not believe they could charge for TRIGTRAN signaling, because first-hop links didn't fail frequently and TRIGTRAN provided no reduction in operating expenses, so there was little incentive to purchase and deploy TRIGTRAN-capable network equipment.</li>
          </ul>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5.2-3">It is also worth noting that the targeted environment for TRIGTRAN in the late 1990s contained links with a relatively small number of directly connected hosts -- for instance, cellular or satellite links. The transport community was well aware of the dangers of sender synchronization based on multiple senders receiving the same stimulus at the same time, but the working assumption for TRIGTRAN was that there wouldn't be enough senders for this to be a meaningful problem. In the 2010s, it was  common for a single "link" to support many senders and receivers, likely requiring TRIGTRAN senders to wait some random amount of time before sending after receiving a TRIGTRAN signal, which would have reduced the benefits of TRIGTRAN even more.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6-3">The IPv6 routing architecture <xref target="RFC1887" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1887"/> assumed that most sites on the Internet would be identified by Provider Assigned IPv6 prefixes, so that Default-Free Zone routers only contained routes to other providers, resulting in a very small IPv6 global routing table.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6-4">For a single-homed site, this could work well. A multihomed site with only one upstream provider could also work well, although BGP multihoming from a single upstream provider was often a premium service (costing more than twice as much as two single-homed sites), and if the single upstream provider went out of service, all of the multihomed paths could fail simultaneously.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6-5">IPv4 sites often multihomed by obtaining Provider Independent prefixes and advertising these prefixes through multiple upstream providers. With the assumption that any multihomed IPv4 site would also multihome in IPv6, it seemed likely that IPv6 routing would be subject to the same pressures to announce Provider Independent prefixes, resulting in an IPv6 global routing table that exhibited the same explosive growth as the IPv4 global routing table. During the early 2000s, work began on a protocol that would provide multihoming for IPv6 sites without requiring sites to advertise Provider Independent prefixes into the IPv6 global routing table.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6-6">This protocol, called "Shim6", allowed two endpoints to exchange multiple addresses ("Locators") that all mapped to the same endpoint ("Identity"). After an endpoint learned multiple Locators for the other endpoint, it could send to any of those Locators with the expectation that those packets would all be delivered to the endpoint with the same Identity. Shim6 was an example of an "Identity/Locator Split" protocol.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6-7">Shim6, as defined in <xref target="RFC5533" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5533"/> and related RFCs, provided a workable solution for IPv6 multihoming using Provider Assigned prefixes, including capability discovery and negotiation, and allowing end-to-end application communication to continue even in the face of path failure, because applications don't see Locator failures and continue to communicate with the same Identity using a different Locator.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-1">Note that the problem being addressed was "site multihoming", but Shim6 was providing "host multihoming". That meant that the decision about what path would be used was under host control, not under edge router control.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-2">Although more work could have been done to provide a better technical solution, the biggest impediments to Shim6 deployment were operational and business considerations. These impediments were discussed at multiple network operator group meetings, including <xref target="Shim6-35" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Shim6-35"/> at <xref target="NANOG-35" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NANOG-35"/>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-3">The technical issues centered around concerns that Shim6 relied on the host to track all the connections, while also tracking Identity/Locator mappings in the kernel and tracking failures to recognize that an available path has failed.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-4">The operational issues centered around concerns that operators were performing traffic engineering on traffic aggregates. With Shim6, these operator traffic engineering policies must be pushed down to individual hosts.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-5">In addition, operators would have no visibility or control over the decision of hosts choosing to switch to another path. They expressed concerns that relying on hosts to steer traffic exposed operator networks to oscillation based on feedback loops, if hosts moved from path to path frequently. Given that Shim6 was intended to support multihoming across operators, operators providing only one of the paths would have even less visibility as traffic suddenly appeared and disappeared on their networks.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-6">In addition, firewalls that expected to find a TCP or UDP transport-level protocol header in the IP payload would see a Shim6 Identity header instead, and they would not perform transport-protocol-based firewalling functions because the firewall's normal processing logic would not look past the Identity header.
The firewall would perform its default action, which would most likely be to drop packets that don't match any processing rule.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.6.1-7">The business issues centered on reducing or removing the ability to sell BGP multihoming service to their own customers, which is often more expensive than two single-homed connectivity services.</t>

    with respect to flexibility, mobility, and security compared to
    other network signaling techniques, hardware vendors were reluctant
    to deploy this solution, because it would require additional
    implementation effort and would result in additional complexity for
    router implementations.</t>
              <t indent="0" pn="section-6.7.1-2.1.3">NTLP mainly operates as a path-coupled signaling protocol, i.e.,
    its messages are processed at the control plane of each intermediate node that is 
    also forwarding the data flows. This requires a
    mechanism to intercept signaling packets while they are forwarded
    in the same manner (especially along the same path) as data
    packets. NSIS uses the
    IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Option (RAO) to allow for
    interception of those path-coupled signaling messages, and
    this technique requires router implementations to correctly
    understand and implement the handling of RAOs, e.g., to only
    process packets with RAOs of interest and to leave packets with
    irrelevant RAOs in the fast forwarding processing path (a
    comprehensive discussion of these issues can be found in
    <xref target="RFC6398" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6398"/>). The latter was an issue with some router
    implementations at the time of standardization.</t>
              <t indent="0" pn="section-6.7.1-2.1.4">Another reason is
    that path-coupled signaling protocols that interact with routers
    and request manipulation of state at these routers (or any
    other network element in general) are under scrutiny: a packet (or
    sequence of packets) out of the mainly untrusted data path is
    requesting creation and manipulation of network state. This is
    seen as potentially dangerous (e.g., opens up a DoS threat to a
    router's control plane) and difficult for an operator to control. 
    Path-coupled signaling approaches were considered problematic (see also <xref target="RFC6398" sectionFormat="of" section="3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6398#section-3" derivedContent="RFC6398"/>). There are

    required trust between customers and their provider, but also among
    different providers. In particular, QoS signaling techniques would
    require some kind of dynamic SLA support that
    would imply (potentially quite complex) bilateral negotiations
    between different Internet Service Providers. This complexity was 
    not considered to be justified, and increasing the
    bandwidth (and thus avoiding bottlenecks) was 
    cheaper than actively managing network resource bottlenecks by
    using path-coupled QoS signaling techniques. Furthermore, an
    end-to-end path typically involves several provider domains, and
    these providers need to closely cooperate in cases of failures.</t>

There needs to be an incentive for an endpoint to set an appropriate non-zero value. 
The value should appropriately reflect the level of aggregation the traffic expects to be provided by the network. However, this requires the stack  to know granularity at which flows should be identified (or, conversely, which flows should receive aggregated treatment), i.e., which packets carry the same flow label. Therefore, setting a non-zero value may result in additional choices that need to be made by an application developer.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.8.2-1">The flow label is a general-purpose header field for use by the path. Multiple uses have been proposed. One candidate use was to reduce the  complexity of forwarding decisions. However,  modern routers can use a "fast path", often taking advantage of hardware to accelerate processing. The method can assist in more complex forwarding, such as ECMP routing and load balancing.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.8.2-2">Although <xref target="RFC6437" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6437"/> recommended that endpoints should by default choose uniformly distributed labels for their traffic, the specification permitted an endpoint to choose to set a zero value. This ability of endpoints to choose to set a flow label of zero has had consequences on deployability:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-6.8.2-3">
            <li pn="section-6.8.2-3.1">Before wide-scale support by endpoints, it would be impossible to rely on a non-zero flow label being set. Network nodes therefore would need to also employ other techniques to realize equivalent functions. An example of a method is one assuming semantics of the source port field to provide entropy input to a network-layer hash. This use of a 5-tuple to classify a packet represents a layering violation <xref target="RFC6294" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6294"/>. When other methods have been deployed, they increase the cost of deploying standards-based methods, even though they may offer less control to  endpoints and result in potential interaction with other uses/interpretation of the field.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.8.2-3.2">Even though the flow label is specified as an end-to-end field, some network paths have been observed to not transparently forward the flow label. This could result from non-conformant equipment or could indicate that some operational networks have chosen to reuse the protocol field for other (e.g., internal) purposes. This results in lack of transparency, and a deployment hurdle to endpoints expecting that they can set a flow label that is utilized by the network.  The more recent practice of "greasing" <xref target="I-D.iab-use-it-or-lose-it" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GREASE"/> would suggest that a different outcome could have been achieved if endpoints were always required to set a non-zero value.</li>
            <li pn="section-6.8.2-3.3">
              <xref target="RFC1809" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1809"/> noted that setting the choice of the flow label value can depend on the expectations of the traffic generated by an application, which suggests that an API should be presented to control the setting or policy that is used. However, many currently available APIs do not have this support.</li>
          </ul>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.8.2-4">A growth in the use of encrypted transports (e.g., QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>) seems likely to raise issues similar to those discussed above and could motivate renewed interest in utilizing the flow label.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.9-3">In the early 1990s, the large majority of Internet traffic used TCP as its transport protocol, but TCP had no way to detect path congestion before the path was so congested that packets were being dropped. These congestion events could affect all senders using a path, either by "lockout", where long-lived flows monopolized the queues along a path, or by "full queues", where queues remain full, or almost full, for a long period of time.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.9-4">In response to this situation, "Active Queue Management" (AQM) was deployed in the network. A number of AQM disciplines have been deployed, but one common approach was that routers dropped packets when a threshold buffer length was reached, so that transport protocols like TCP that were responsive to loss would detect this loss and reduce their sending rates. Random Early Detection (RED) was one such proposal in the IETF. As the name suggests, a router using RED as its AQM discipline that detected time-averaged queue lengths passing a threshold would choose incoming packets probabilistically to be dropped <xref target="RFC2309" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2309"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.9-5">Researchers suggested providing "explicit congestion notifications" to senders when routers along the path detected that their queues were building,
giving senders an opportunity to "slow down" as if a loss had occurred, giving path queues time to drain, while the path still had sufficient buffer capacity to accommodate bursty arrivals of packets from other senders. This was proposed as an experiment in <xref target="RFC2481" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2481"/> and standardized in <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/>.</t>

Even if subsequent router vendors fixed these implementations, ECN was still disabled on end nodes, and given the trade-off between the benefits of enabling ECN (somewhat better behavior during congestion) and the risks of enabling ECN (possibly crashing a router somewhere along the path), ECN tended to stay disabled on implementations that supported ECN for decades afterwards.</t>

Neither of these factors were true in the early 2000s.</t>

            <t indent="0">   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that
   communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.

   This memo suggests that the existing threat model, while important
   and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient to cater for the
   pressing security issues in the Internet.  For instance, it is also
   necessary to protect systems against endpoints that are compromised,
   malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests
   of the users.  While such protection is difficult, there are some
   measures that can be taken.

   It is particularly important to ensure that as we continue to develop
   Internet technology, non-communications security related threats are
   properly understood.  While the consideration of these issues is
   relatively new in the IETF, this memo provides some initial ideas
   about potential broader threat models to consider when designing
   protocols for the Internet or when trying to defend against pervasive
   monitoring.  Further down the road, updated threat models could
   result in changes in RFC 3552 (guidelines for writing security
   considerations) and RFC 7258 (pervasive monitoring), to include
   proper consideration of non-communications security threats.  It may
   also be necessary to have dedicated guidance on how systems design
   and architecture affects security.

   allowing  multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow
   specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation
   Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps
   optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints
   in a single round trip.

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">   In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware
   internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes
   the properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and provides
   for endpoints and applications to use these properties to select
   paths through the Internet for their traffic.  While this property of
   "path awareness" already exists in many Internet-connected networks
   within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the
   network layer, a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts
   across layers and across the Internet.

   This document poses questions in path-aware networking open as of
   2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and
   deployment of path-aware internetworks.  It was originally written to
   frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed Research
   Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in
   this space.

            <t indent="0">This document specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a data transfer (e.g., after an idle period).  While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP.  Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request.</t>

These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start.  These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options.  Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks.  This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path.  As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

The design uses existing transport and security protocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for diverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling application state itself, but manages its own internal state and the configuration of the underlying transport and security protocols to enable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow path.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and security protocols provides a solution for the base protocol component of the "Next Steps in Signalling" (NSIS) framework.

The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and provides examples.

The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option, thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711. Specifically, it provides recommendations against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service providers.  Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.

            <t indent="0">This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted TCP initial window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390, to 10 segments with a fallback to the existing recommendation when performance issues are detected.  It discusses the motivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages of the higher initial window, and presents results from several large-scale experiments showing that the higher initial window improves the overall performance of many web services without resulting in a congestion collapse.  The document closes with a discussion of usage and deployment for further experimental purposes recommended by the IETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).  The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK.  The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol stack).  This report summarizes contributions and discussions.  As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration.</t>
            <t indent="0">Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</t>

            <t indent="0">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
            <t indent="0">Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
            <t indent="0">Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</t>

            <t indent="0">Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol, we have seen a number of transitions throughout the protocol stack, such as deploying a new protocol, or updating or replacing an existing protocol.  Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>
