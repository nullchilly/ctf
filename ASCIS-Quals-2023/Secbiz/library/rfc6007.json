Dependent path computations are\r\nrequests that need to be synchronized in order to meet specific\r\nobjectives.  An example of a dependent request would be a PCE\r\ncomputing a set of services that are required to be diverse\r\n(disjointed) from each other.  When a PCE computes sets of dependent\r\npath computation requests concurrently, use of the Synchronization\r\nVECtor (SVEC) list is required for association among the sets of\r\ndependent path computation requests.  The SVEC object is optional and\r\ncarried within the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol\r\n(PCEP) PCRequest (PCReq) message.\r\n\r\nThis document does not specify the PCEP SVEC object or procedure.\r\nThis informational document clarifies the use of the SVEC list for\r\nsynchronized path computations when computing dependent requests.\r\nThe document also describes a number of usage scenarios for SVEC\r\nlists within single-domain and multi-domain environments.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6007","errata_url":null}
