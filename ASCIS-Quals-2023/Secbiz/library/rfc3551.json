{"draft":"draft-ietf-avt-profile-new-13","doc_id":"RFC3551","title":" RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control ","authors":["H. Schulzrinne","S. Casner"],"format":["ASCII","PS","PDF","HTML"],"page_count":"44","pub_status":"DRAFT STANDARD","status":"INTERNET STANDARD","source":"Audio\/Video Transport","abstract":" This document describes a profile called \"RTP\/AVP\" for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control.  It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences.  In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP.  It defines a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP.  The descriptions provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.  This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other real-time multimedia applications. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890.  It is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable implementations were not found.  The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published.
