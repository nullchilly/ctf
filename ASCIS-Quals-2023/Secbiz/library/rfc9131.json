Linkova"],"format":["HTML","TEXT","PDF","XML"],"page_count":"20","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IPv6 Maintenance","abstract":"Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the\r\nlink-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and\r\nmaintain reachability information. This document updates RFC 4861 to\r\nallow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new\r\nIPv6 address is assigned to a node. It also updates RFC 4861 and\r\nrecommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon\r\nassigning a new IPv6 address. These changes will minimize the delay\r\nand packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link\r\ndestination from a new IPv6 address.","pub_date":"October 2021","keywords":["IPv6","SLAAC","stateless address autoconfiguration","neighbor advertisement"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4861"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9131","errata_url":null}
