A Grid\r\nis a good example of such a multi-domain project.  Each of the\r\nparticipants follows different procedures for handling trouble in its\r\ndomain, according to the local technical and linguistic profile.  The\r\nTT systems of the participants collect, represent, and disseminate TT\r\ninformation in different formats.\r\n\r\nAs a result, management of the daily workload by a central Network\r\nOperation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own.  Normalization of\r\nTTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation,\r\nstoring, and handling of the TTs.  In the present document, we\r\nprovide a model for automating the collection and normalization of\r\nthe TT received by multiple networks forming the Grid.  Each of the\r\nparticipants is using its home TT system within its domain for\r\nhandling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering the\r\ntickets in the normalized format for repository and handling.  XML is\r\nused as the common representation language.  The model was defined\r\nand used as part of the networking support activity of the EGEE\r\n(Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["Grid","Management","EGEE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6137","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6137"}
