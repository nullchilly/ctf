In\r\npractice, user agents are often unwilling to send those request\r\nheaders, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and\r\nsending them impacts both performance and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can\r\nuse to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content\r\nnegotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such\r\nheaders, colloquially known as \"Client Hints.\"","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":["Content Negotiation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8942","errata_url":null}
