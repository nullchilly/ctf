The process\r\nis expected to be completed over a timescale of several years.\r\nConsequently, no emergency transition is specified.  The transition\r\nprocedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration\r\n(parent migrates before children).","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":["Resource Public Key Infrastructure","RPKI","Algorithm Transition","SIDR","routing security","BGP security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0182"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6916","errata_url":null}
