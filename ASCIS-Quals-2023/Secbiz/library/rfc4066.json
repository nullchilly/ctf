The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and finding their capabilities. This process is called \"candidate access router discovery\" (CARD).  At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR, whose capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen as the target AR for handover.  The protocol described in this document allows a mobile node to perform CARD.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2005","keywords":["mobile node","mn","cars","candidate ars"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4066","errata_url":null}
