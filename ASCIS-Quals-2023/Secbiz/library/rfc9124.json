Ensuring that devices function and\r\nremain secure over their service lifetime requires such an update\r\nmechanism to fix vulnerabilities, update configuration settings, and\r\nadd new functionality.\r\n\r\nOne component of such a firmware update is a concise and\r\nmachine-processable metadata document, or manifest, that describes\r\nthe firmware image(s) and offers appropriate protection. This\r\ndocument describes the information that must be present in the\r\nmanifest.","pub_date":"January 2022","keywords":["computer security","smart objects"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9124","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9124"}
