This document describes a\r\nversion negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to\r\nselect a mutually supported version. Optionally, if the client's\r\nchosen version and the negotiated version share a compatible first\r\nflight format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an\r\nextra round trip.
