      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have
      supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such
      encryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the
      transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol
      ossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport
      protocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current
      operational practice in some networks inspect transport header
      information within the network, but this is no longer possible when
      those transport headers are encrypted.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This document discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses
      a protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues to
      consider when designing new transport protocols or features.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The transport layer supports the end-to-end flow of data across a
      network path, providing features such as connection establishment,
      reliability, framing, ordering, congestion control, flow control, etc.,
      as needed to support applications. One of the core functions of an
      Internet transport is to discover and adapt to the characteristics of
      the network path that is currently being used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">For some years, it has been common for the transport-layer payload to
      be protected by encryption and authentication but for the transport-layer 
      headers to be sent unprotected. Examples of protocols that behave
      in this manner include Transport Layer Security
      (TLS) over TCP <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446"/>, Datagram TLS <xref target="RFC6347" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6347"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DTLS"/>, the Secure
      Real-time Transport Protocol <xref target="RFC3711" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3711"/>, and tcpcrypt <xref target="RFC8548" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8548"/>. The use of unencrypted transport headers has led some
      network operators, researchers, and others to develop tools and
      processes that rely on observations of transport headers both in
      aggregate and at the flow level to infer details of the network's
      behaviour and inform operational practice.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Transport protocols are now being developed that encrypt some or all
      of the transport headers, in addition to the transport payload data. The
      QUIC transport protocol <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>
      is an example of such a protocol. Such transport header encryption makes
      it difficult to observe transport protocol behaviour from the vantage
      point of the network. This document discusses some implications of
      transport header encryption for network operators and researchers that
      have previously observed transport headers, and it highlights some issues
      to consider for transport protocol designers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">As discussed in <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/>, the IETF has
      concluded that Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is a technical attack that
      needs to be mitigated in the design of IETF protocols. This document
      supports that conclusion. It also recognises that <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/>
      states, "Making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but
      ignoring PM would go against the consensus documented here. An
      appropriate balance will emerge over time as real instances of this
      tension are considered." This document is written to provide input to
      the discussion around what is an appropriate balance by highlighting
      some implications of transport header encryption.</t>

      transport header encryption.</t>

      revelations and the IETF consensus that "Pervasive Monitoring Is an
      Attack" <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/>, efforts are underway to increase
      encryption of Internet traffic. Applying confidentiality to transport
      header fields can improve privacy and can help to mitigate certain
      attacks or manipulation of packets by devices on the network path, but
      it can also affect network operations and measurement <xref target="RFC8404" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8404"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">When considering what parts of the transport headers should be
      encrypted to provide confidentiality and what parts should be visible
      to network devices (including unencrypted but authenticated headers),
      it is necessary to consider both the impact on network operations and
      management and the implications for ossification and user privacy <xref target="Measurement" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Measurement"/>. Different parties will view the relative
      importance of these concerns differently. For some, the benefits of
      encrypting all the transport headers outweigh the impact of doing so;
      others might analyse the security, privacy, and ossification impacts and
      arrive at a different trade-off.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">This section reviews examples of the observation of transport-layer
      headers within the network by using devices on the network path or by using
      information exported by an on-path device. Unencrypted transport headers
      provide information that can support network operations and management,
      and this section notes some ways in which this has been done.
      Unencrypted transport header information also contributes metadata that
      can be exploited for purposes unrelated to network transport
      measurement, diagnostics, or troubleshooting (e.g., to block or to
      throttle traffic from a specific content provider), and this section
      also notes some threats relating to unencrypted transport headers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">Exposed transport information also provides a source of information
      that contributes to linked data sets, which could be exploited to deduce
      private information, e.g., user patterns, user location, tracking
      behaviour, etc. This might reveal information the parties did not intend
      to be revealed. <xref target="RFC6973" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6973"/> aims to make designers,
      implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware of privacy-related

        load sharing across paths (e.g., Equal-Cost Multipath

        Group (LAG)); ensuring equal access to link capacity (e.g., Fair
        Queuing (FQ)); or distributing traffic to servers (e.g., load
        balancing). To prevent packet reordering, forwarding engines can
        consistently forward the same transport flows along the same
        forwarding path, often achieved by calculating a hash using an n-tuple
        gleaned from a combination of link header information through to
        transport header information. This n-tuple can use the Media Access Control

        endpoints, additional metadata, such as the state of the network and
        conditions in which the system was observed, is often necessary to
        interpret this data to answer questions about network performance or
        understand a pathology. Collecting and coordinating such metadata is
        more difficult when the observation point is at a different location

        identify issues, such as link performance or capacity sharing between

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">One motive to encrypt transport headers is to prevent network
      ossification from network devices that inspect well-known transport
      headers. Once a network device observes a transport header and becomes
      reliant upon using it, the overall use of that field can become
      ossified, preventing new versions of the protocol and mechanisms from
      being deployed. Examples include:</t>

          exposed in TLS 1.2 <xref target="RFC5426" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5426"/>.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-3.2">The design of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) <xref target="RFC8684" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8684"/> had to account for middleboxes (known as
          "TCP Normalizers") that monitor the evolution of the window
          advertised in the TCP header and then reset connections when the
          window did not grow as expected.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-3.3">TCP Fast Open <xref target="RFC7413" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7413"/> can experience
          problems due to middleboxes that modify the transport header of
          packets by removing "unknown" TCP options. Segments with
          unrecognised TCP options can be dropped, segments that contain data
          and set the SYN bit can be dropped, and some middleboxes that
          disrupt connections can send data before completion of the
          three-way handshake.</li>
        <li pn="section-4-3.4">Other examples of TCP ossification have included middleboxes that
          modify transport headers by rewriting TCP sequence and
          acknowledgement numbers but are unaware of the (newer) TCP
          selective acknowledgement (SACK) option and therefore fail to
          correctly rewrite the SACK information to match the changes made to
          the fixed TCP header, preventing correct SACK operation.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">In all these cases, middleboxes with a hard-coded, but incomplete,
      understanding of a specific transport behaviour (i.e., TCP) interacted
      poorly with transport protocols after the transport behaviour was
      changed. In some cases, the middleboxes modified or replaced information
      in the transport protocol header.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-5">Transport header encryption prevents an on-path device from observing
      the transport headers and therefore stops ossified mechanisms being
      used that directly rely on or infer semantics of the transport header
      information. This encryption is normally combined with authentication of
      the protected information. <xref target="RFC8546" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8546"/> summarises this
      approach, stating
      that "[t]he wire image, not the protocol's specification, determines
      how third parties on the network paths among protocol participants will
      interact with that protocol" (<xref target="RFC8546" sectionFormat="of" section="1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8546#section-1" derivedContent="RFC8546"/>), and it can be expected that header information that is not
      encrypted will become ossified.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-6">Encryption does not itself prevent ossification of the network
      service. People seeking to understand or classify network traffic could
      still come to rely on pattern inferences and other heuristics or machine
      learning to derive measurement data and as the basis for network
      forwarding decisions <xref target="RFC8546" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8546"/>. This can also
      create dependencies on the transport protocol or the patterns of
      traffic it can generate, also resulting in ossification of the
      service.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-7">Another motivation for using transport header encryption is to
      improve privacy and to decrease opportunities for surveillance. Users
      value the ability to protect their identity and location and defend
      against analysis of the traffic. Revelations about the use of pervasive
      surveillance <xref target="RFC7624" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7624"/> have, to some extent, eroded
      trust in the service offered by network operators and have led to an
      increased use of encryption. Concerns have also been voiced about the
      addition of metadata to packets by third parties to provide analytics,
      customisation, advertising, cross-site tracking of users, 
      customer billing, or selectively allowing or blocking content.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-8">Whatever the reasons, the IETF is designing protocols that include
      transport header encryption (e.g., QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/>) to supplement the already
      widespread payload encryption and to further limit exposure of
      transport metadata to the network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-9">If a transport protocol uses header encryption, the designers have to
      decide whether to encrypt all or a part of the transport-layer
      information. <xref target="RFC8558" sectionFormat="of" section="4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8558#section-4" derivedContent="RFC8558"/> states,
      "Anything exposed to the path should be done with the intent that it be
      used by the network elements on the path."</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-10">Certain transport header fields can be made observable to on-path
      network devices or can define new fields designed to explicitly expose
      observable transport-layer information to the network. Where exposed
      fields are intended to be immutable (i.e., can be observed but not
      modified by a network device), the endpoints are encouraged to use
      authentication to provide a cryptographic integrity check that can
      detect if these immutable fields have been modified by network devices.
      Authentication can help to prevent attacks that rely on sending packets
      that fake exposed control signals in transport headers (e.g., TCP RST
      spoofing). Making a part of a transport header observable or exposing
      new header fields can lead to ossification of that part of a header as
      network devices come to rely on observations of the exposed fields.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">Header authentication and encryption and strong integrity checks are being incorporated
      into new transport protocols and have important benefits. The pace of the
      development of transports using the WebRTC data channel and the rapid
      deployment of the QUIC transport protocol can both be attributed to
      using the combination of UDP as a substrate while providing
      confidentiality and authentication of the encapsulated transport headers
      and payload.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">This document has described some current practises, and the
      implications for some stakeholders, when transport-layer header
      encryption is used. It does not judge whether these practises are
      necessary or endorse the use of any specific practise. Rather, the
      intent is to highlight operational tools and practises to consider when
      designing and modifying transport protocols, so protocol designers can
      make informed choices about what transport header fields to encrypt and
      whether it might be beneficial to make an explicit choice to expose
      certain fields to devices on the network path. In making such a
      decision, it is important to balance: </t>
      <dl newline="true" spacing="normal" indent="3" pn="section-7-3">
        <dt pn="section-7-3.1">User Privacy:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.2">The less transport header information that is
          exposed to the network, the lower the risk of leaking metadata that
          might have user privacy implications. Transports that chose to
          expose some header fields need to make a privacy assessment to
          understand the privacy cost versus benefit trade-off in making that
          information available. The design of the QUIC spin bit to the
          network is an example of such considered analysis.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.3">Transport Ossification:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.4">Unencrypted transport header fields are
          likely to ossify rapidly, as network devices come to rely on their
          presence, making it difficult to change the transport in future.
          This argues that the choice to expose information to the network is
          made deliberately and with care, since it is essentially defining a
          stable interface between the transport and the network. Some
          protocols will want to make that interface as limited as possible;
          other protocols might find value in exposing certain information to
          signal to the network or in allowing the network to change certain
          header fields as signals to the transport. The visible wire image of
          a protocol should be explicitly designed.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.5">Network Ossification:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.6">While encryption can reduce ossification of
          the transport protocol, it does not itself prevent ossification of
          the network service. People seeking to understand network traffic
          could still come to rely on pattern inferences and other heuristics
          or machine learning to derive measurement data and as the basis for
          network forwarding decisions <xref target="RFC8546" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8546"/>. This
          creates dependencies on the transport protocol or the patterns of
          traffic it can generate, resulting in ossification of the
          service.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.7">Impact on Operational Practice:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.8">The network operations community
          has long relied on being able to understand Internet traffic
          patterns, both in aggregate and at the flow level, to support
          network management, traffic engineering, and troubleshooting.
          Operational practice has developed based on the information
          available from unencrypted transport headers. The IETF has supported
          this practice by developing operations and management specifications, interface 
	  specifications, and associated Best
          Current Practices. Widespread deployment of transport protocols that
          encrypt their information will impact network operations unless
          operators can develop alternative practises that work without access
          to the transport header.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.9">Pace of Evolution:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.10">Removing obstacles to change can enable an
          increased pace of evolution. If a protocol changes its transport
          header format (wire image) or its transport behaviour, this can
          result in the currently deployed tools and methods becoming no
          longer relevant. Where this needs to be accompanied by development
          of appropriate operational support functions and procedures, it can
          incur a cost in new tooling to catch up with each change. Protocols
          that consistently expose observable data do not require such
          development but can suffer from ossification and need to consider
          if the exposed protocol metadata has privacy implications. There is
          no single deployment context; therefore, designers need to
          consider the diversity of operational networks (ISPs, enterprises,
          DDoS mitigation and firewall maintainers, etc.).</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.11">Supporting Common Specifications:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.12">Common, open, transport
          specifications can stimulate engagement by developers, users,
          researchers, and the broader community. Increased protocol diversity
          can be beneficial in meeting new requirements, but the ability to
          innovate without public scrutiny risks point solutions that optimise
          for specific cases and that can accidentally disrupt operations
          of/in different parts of the network. The social contract that
          maintains the stability of the Internet relies on accepting common
          transport specifications and on it being possible to detect
          violations. The existence of independent measurements, transparency,
          and public scrutiny of transport protocol behaviour helps the
          community to enforce the social norm that protocol implementations
          behave fairly and conform (at least mostly) to the specifications.
          It is important to find new ways of maintaining that community trust
          as increased use of transport header encryption limits visibility
          into transport behaviour (see also <xref target="exposing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.3"/>).</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.13">Impact on Benchmarking and Understanding Feature Interactions:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.14">An appropriate vantage point for observation, coupled with timing
          information about traffic flows, provides a valuable tool for
          benchmarking network devices, endpoint stacks, and/or
          configurations. This can help understand complex feature
          interactions. An inability to observe transport header information
          can make it harder to diagnose and explore interactions between
          features at different protocol layers, a side effect of not allowing
          a choice of vantage point from which this information is observed.
          New approaches might have to be developed.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-7-3.15">Impact on Research and Development:</dt>
        <dd pn="section-7-3.16">Hiding transport header
          information can impede independent research into new mechanisms,
          measurements of behaviour, and development initiatives. Experience
          shows that transport protocols are complicated to design and complex
          to deploy and that individual mechanisms have to be evaluated while
          considering other mechanisms across a broad range of network
          topologies and with attention to the impact on traffic sharing the
          capacity. If increased use of transport header encryption results in
          reduced availability of open data, it could eliminate the
          independent checks to the standardisation process that have
          previously been in place from research and academic contributors
          (e.g., the role of the IRTF Internet Congestion Control Research
          Group (ICCRG) and research publications in reviewing new transport
          mechanisms and assessing the impact of their deployment).</dd>
      </dl>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4">Observable transport header information might be useful to various
      stakeholders. Other sets of stakeholders have incentives to limit what
      can be observed. This document does not make recommendations about what
      information ought to be exposed, to whom it ought to be observable, or
      how this will be achieved. There are also design choices about where
      observable fields are placed. For example, one location could be a part
      of the transport header outside of the encryption envelope; another
      alternative is to carry the information in a network-layer option or
      extension header. New transport protocol designs ought to explicitly
      identify any fields that are intended to be observed, consider if there
      are alternative ways of providing the information, and reflect on the
      implications of observable fields being used by on-path network devices
      and how this might impact user privacy and protocol evolution when these
      fields become ossified.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-5">As <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/> notes, "Making networks
      unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable
      outcome, but ignoring PM would go against the
      consensus documented here." Providing explicit information can help
      avoid traffic being inappropriately classified, impacting application
      performance. An appropriate balance will emerge over time as real
      instances of this tension are analysed <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/>.
      This balance between information exposed and information hidden ought to
      be carefully considered when specifying new transport protocols.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-1">This document is about design and deployment considerations for
      transport protocols. Issues relating to security are discussed
      throughout this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">Authentication, confidentiality protection, and integrity protection
      are identified as transport features by <xref target="RFC8095" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8095"/>.
      As currently deployed in the Internet, these features are generally
      provided by a protocol or layer on top of the transport protocol <xref target="RFC8922" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8922"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">Confidentiality and strong integrity checks have properties that can
      also be incorporated into the design of a transport protocol or to
      modify an existing transport. Integrity checks can protect an endpoint
      from undetected modification of protocol fields by on-path network
      devices, whereas encryption and obfuscation or greasing can further
      prevent these headers being utilised by network devices <xref target="RFC8701" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8701"/>. Preventing observation of headers provides an
      opportunity for greater freedom to update the protocols and can ease
      experimentation with new techniques and their final deployment in
      endpoints. A protocol specification needs to weigh the costs of
      ossifying common headers versus the potential benefits of exposing
      specific information that could be observed along the network path to
      provide tools to manage new variants of protocols.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">Header encryption can provide confidentiality of some or all of the
      transport header information. This prevents an on-path device from
      gaining knowledge of the header field. It therefore prevents mechanisms
      being built that directly rely on the information or seeks to infer
      semantics of an exposed header field. Reduced visibility into transport
      metadata can limit the ability to measure and characterise traffic and
      conversely can provide privacy benefits.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-5">Extending the transport payload security context to also include the
      transport protocol header protects both types of information with the
      same key. A privacy concern would arise if this key was shared with a
      third party, e.g., providing access to transport header information to
      debug a performance issue would also result in exposing the transport
      payload data to the same third party. Such risks would be mitigated
      using a layered security design that provides one domain of protection
      and associated keys for the transport payload and encrypted transport
      headers and a separate domain of protection and associated keys for any
      observable transport header fields.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-6">Exposed transport headers are sometimes utilised as a part of the
      information to detect anomalies in network traffic. As stated in <xref target="RFC7258" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7258"/>, "While PM is an
      attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the definition of PM
      can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g., network management
      functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see
      mail message content." This can be used
      as the first line of defence to identify potential threats from DoS or
      malware and redirect suspect traffic to dedicated nodes responsible for
      DoS analysis, for malware detection, or to perform packet "scrubbing" (the
      normalisation of packets so that there are no ambiguities in
      interpretation by the ultimate destination of the packet). These
      techniques are currently used by some operators to also defend from
      distributed DoS attacks.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-7">Exposed transport header fields can also form a part of the
      information used by the receiver of a transport protocol to protect the
      transport layer from data injection by an attacker. In evaluating this
      use of exposed header information, it is important to consider whether
      it introduces a significant DoS threat. For example, an attacker could
      construct a DoS attack by sending packets with a sequence number that
      falls within the currently accepted range of sequence numbers at the
      receiving endpoint. This would then introduce additional work at the
      receiving endpoint, even though the data in the attacking packet might
      not finally be delivered by the transport layer. This is sometimes known
      as a "shadowing attack". An attack can, for example, disrupt
      receiver processing, trigger loss and retransmission, or make a
      receiving endpoint perform unproductive decryption of packets that
      cannot be successfully decrypted (forcing a receiver to commit
      decryption resources, or to update and then restore protocol state).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-8">One mitigation to off-path attacks is to deny knowledge of what header
      information is accepted by a receiver or obfuscate the accepted header
      information, e.g., setting a nonpredictable initial value for a
      sequence number during a protocol handshake, as in <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550"/>
      and <xref target="RFC6056" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6056"/>, or a port
      value that cannot be predicted (see <xref target="RFC8085" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8085#section-5.1" derivedContent="RFC8085"/>). A receiver could also require additional
      information to be used as a part of a validation check before accepting
      packets at the transport layer, e.g., utilising a part of the sequence
      number space that is encrypted or by verifying an encrypted token not
      visible to an attacker. This would also mitigate against on-path
      attacks. An additional processing cost can be incurred when decryption
      is attempted before a receiver discards an injected packet.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-9">The existence of open transport protocol standards and a research
      and operations community with a history of independent observation and
      evaluation of performance data encourage fairness and conformance to
      those standards. This suggests careful consideration will be made over
      where, and when, measurement samples are collected. An appropriate
      balance between encrypting some or all of the transport header
      information needs to be considered. Open data and accessibility to
      tools that can help understand trends in application deployment, network
      traffic, and usage patterns can all contribute to understanding security
      challenges.</t>

   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet

   discusses the data fields and associated data types for in-situ OAM.
   In-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated into a variety of
   protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, IPv6 (via extension
   header), or IPv4.  In-situ OAM can be used to complement OAM
   mechanisms based on e.g.  ICMP or other types of probe packets.

Abstract

   This document describes the operation of three abstract mechanisms
   for supporting an explicitly cooperative path layer in the Internet
   architecture.  Three mechanisms are described: sender to path
   signaling with receiver integrity verification; path to receiver
   signaling with confidential feedback to sender; and direct path to
   sender signaling.

   logging format called qlog.  This format allows easy sharing of data
   and the creation of reusable visualization and debugging tools.  The
   high-level schema in this document is intended to be protocol-
   agnostic.  Separate documents specify how the format should be used
   for specific protocol data.  The schema is also format-agnostic, and
   can be represented in for example JSON, csv or protobuf.

            <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

            <t indent="0">Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses.  Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

It provides motivations for the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information required for all metrics.  The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design. Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router.

However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric.

RD is a comprehensive metric that captures the characteristics of reordering, while RBD evaluates the sequences from the point of view of recovery from reordering.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document specifies the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), which obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC 2385 (TCP MD5).  TCP-AO specifies the use of stronger Message Authentication Codes (MACs), protects against replays even for long-lived TCP connections, and provides more details on the association of security with TCP connections than TCP MD5.  TCP-AO is compatible with either a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints.  The result is intended to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs with minimal other system and operational changes.  TCP-AO uses a different option identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to be used simultaneously.  TCP-AO supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with the proposed requirements for the replacement of TCP MD5.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t indent="0">During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The algorithms described in this document are local policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP, UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers).

            <t indent="0">The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber.  Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea of shared IPv4 addressing.  These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches.  Such issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity, new security vulnerabilities, and so on.  Solution-specific discussions are out of scope.</t>

TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation.  As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance.  There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations.  The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

            <t indent="0">The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms.  This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP.  Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
            <t indent="0">Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic.  They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
            <t indent="0">Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>

            <t indent="0">The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association (GSMA) held a joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW), on September 24-25, 2015.  This workshop aimed to discuss solutions for bandwidth optimization on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted content, which is not indicative of the security needs of today's Internet users.  The workshop gathered IETF attendees, IAB members, and participants from various organizations involved in the telecommunications industry including original equipment manufacturers, content providers, and mobile network operators.</t>
            <t indent="0">The group discussed Internet encryption trends and deployment issues identified within the IETF and the privacy needs of users that should be adhered to.  Solutions designed around sharing data from the network to the endpoints and vice versa were then discussed; in addition, issues experienced when using current transport-layer protocols were also discussed.  Content providers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) gave their own views of their experiences delivering their content with mobile network operators.  Finally, technical responses to regulation were discussed to help the regulated industries relay the issues of impossible-to-implement or bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators.</t>
            <t indent="0">A group of suggested solutions were devised, which will be discussed in various IETF groups moving forward.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document specifies "tcpcrypt", a TCP encryption protocol designed for use in conjunction with the TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO).  Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.  The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable. Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before application data can be transmitted.  However, the extra latency can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous tcpcrypt connection.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals. Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.</t>

            <t indent="0">TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This document defines the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional fragmentation mechanism. SCHC has been designed with Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) in mind.</t>
            <t indent="0">SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored both in the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side. This document defines a generic header compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP headers.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document also specifies an optional fragmentation and reassembly mechanism. It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the Layer 2 maximum payload size.</t>
            <t indent="0">The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This document defines generic functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two SCHC entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology or a product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in other documents. Data models for the context and profiles are out of scope.</t>
