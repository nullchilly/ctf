This information model is maintained as the IANA \"IPFIX                        \r\nInformation Elements\" registry, the initial contents of which were\r\ndefined by RFC 5102.  This information model is used by the IPFIX\r\nprotocol for encoding measured traffic information and information\r\nrelated to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering\r\nProcess, and the Exporting Process.  Although this model was developed\r\nfor the IPFIX protocol, it is defined in an open way that allows it\r\nto be easily used in other protocols, interfaces, and applications.\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5102.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC5102"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7012","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7012"}
