{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC2346","title":" Making Postscript and PDF International ","authors":["J. Palme"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"6","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Legacy","abstract":" Certain text formats, for example Postscript (MIME-Type: application\/postscript; file extension .ps) and Portable Document Format (MIME-Type: application\/pdf; file extension .pdf) specify exactly the page layout of the printed document. The commonly used paper format is different in North America and the rest of the world.  North America uses the 'Letter' format, while the rest of the world mostly uses the ISO-standard 'A4' format. This means that documents formatted on one continent may not be easily printable on another continent. This memo gives advice on how to produce documents which are equally well printable with the Letter and the A4 formats.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
