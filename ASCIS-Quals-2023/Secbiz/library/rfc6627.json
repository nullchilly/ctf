On every link in the PCN-domain, the overall rate of\r\nPCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when\r\ncertain configured rates are exceeded.  Egress nodes provide decision points\r\nwith information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets that allows them\r\nto take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request,\r\nand to terminate some already admitted flows during serious \\%pre-congestion.\r\n\r\nThe PCN working group explored a number of approaches for encoding\r\nthis pre-congestion information into the IP header.  This document provides\r\ndetails of those approaches along with an explanation of the constraints that\r\napply to any solution.
