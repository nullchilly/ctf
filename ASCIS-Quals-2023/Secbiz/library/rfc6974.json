This document does not propose any new\r\nmechanisms or protocols.  Requirements for MPLS-TP protection\r\nespecially for protection in ring topologies are discussed in\r\n\"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile\" (RFC 5654) and \r\n\"MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Survivability Framework\" (RFC 6372).\r\nThis document discusses how most of the requirements are met by\r\napplying linear protection as defined in RFC 6378 in a ring topology.","pub_date":"July 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6974","errata_url":null}
