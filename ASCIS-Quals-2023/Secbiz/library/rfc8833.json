The\r\n\"webrtc\" label identifies regular WebRTC: a DTLS session that is used\r\nto establish keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)\r\nor to establish data channels using the Stream Control Transmission\r\nProtocol (SCTP) over DTLS.  The \"c-webrtc\" label describes the same\r\nprotocol, but the peers also agree to maintain the confidentiality of\r\nthe media by not sharing it with other applications.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["ALPN","Protocol","Identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8833","errata_url":null}
