Being structure-aware, TDMoIP is able to ensure\r\nTDM structure integrity, and thus withstand network degradations\r\nbetter than structure-agnostic transport.  Structure-aware methods\r\ncan distinguish individual channels, enabling packet loss concealment\r\nand bandwidth conservation.  Accessibility of TDM signaling\r\nfacilitates mechanisms that exploit or manipulate signaling.
