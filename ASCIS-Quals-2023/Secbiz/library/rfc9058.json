MGM is defined for use with 64-bit\r\nand 128-bit block ciphers. \r\n\r\nMGM has been standardized in Russia. It is used as an AEAD mode for\r\nthe GOST block cipher algorithms in many protocols, e.g., TLS 1.3 and\r\nIPsec. This document provides a reference for MGM to enable review of\r\nthe mechanisms in use and to make MGM available for use with any\r\nblock cipher.","pub_date":"June 2021","keywords":["authenticated encryption","mode of operation","AEAD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9058","errata_url":null}
