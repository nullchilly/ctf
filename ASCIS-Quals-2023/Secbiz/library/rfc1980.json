Seidman"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"7","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"HISTORIC","source":"Legacy","abstract":"The markup language known as \"HTML\/2.0\" provides for image maps.\r\nImage maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas\r\nof an image to reference different network resources, as specified by\r\nUniform Identifier (URIs).  The image map capability in HTML\/2.0 is\r\nlimited in several ways, such as the restriction that it only works\r\nwith documents served via the \"HTTP\" protocol, and the lack of a\r\nviable fallback for users of text-only browsers.  This document\r\nspecifies an extension to the HTML language, referred to as \"Client-\r\nSide Image Maps,\" which resolves these limitations.","pub_date":"July 1996","keywords":["HyperText","Markup","Language","Uniform","Identifier","URI"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC2854"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC1980","errata_url":null}
