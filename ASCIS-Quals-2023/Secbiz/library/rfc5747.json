This document describes a mechanism for\r\nautomatic discovery and creation of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels via\r\nextensions to multiprotocol BGP.  It is targeted at connecting\r\nislands of IPv4 networks across an IPv6-only backbone without the\r\nneed for a manually configured overlay of tunnels.  The mechanisms\r\ndescribed in this document have been implemented, tested, and\r\ndeployed on the large research IPv6 network in China.  This document\r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["[--------]","IPv4\/IPv6","coexistence","CNGI","CERNET2","Softwire mesh"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5747","errata_url":null}
