SRMP is intended\r\nfor use in a distributed simulation application environment, where\r\nonly the latest value of reliable transmission for any particular\r\ndata identifier requires delivery.  SRMP has two sublayers: a\r\nbundling sublayer handling message aggregation and congestion\r\ncontrol, and a Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer.\r\nSelection between reliable and best-effort messages is performed\r\nby the application.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2006","keywords":["transport","best-effort","srt","selectively reliable transport"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4410","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4410"}
