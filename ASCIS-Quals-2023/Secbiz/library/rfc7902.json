The\r\nattribute contains a one-octet \"Flags\" field.  The purpose of this\r\ndocument is to establish an IANA registry for the assignment of the\r\nbits in this field.  Since the \"Flags\" field contains only eight\r\nbits, this document also defines a new BGP Extended Community,\r\n\"Additional PMSI Tunnel Attribute Flags\", that can be used to carry\r\nadditional flags for the \"P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)                  \r\nTunnel\" attribute.
