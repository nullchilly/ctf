It provides\r\nrecommendations for how the SIP location conveyance mechanism should\r\nadapt to this ambiguity.\r\n\r\nDocuments standardizing the SIP location conveyance mechanisms will\r\nbe Standards-Track documents processed according to the usual SIP\r\nprocess.  This document is intended primarily to provide the SIP\r\nworking group with a statement of the consensus of the GEOPRIV\r\nworking group on this topic.  It secondarily provides tutorial\r\ninformation on the problem space for the general reader.  This \r\nmemo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2009","keywords":["pidf-lo","presence information data format for location objects"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5606","errata_url":null}
