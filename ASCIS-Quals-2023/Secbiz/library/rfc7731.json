MPL avoids the need to construct or maintain\r\nany multicast forwarding topology, disseminating messages to all MPL\r\nForwarders in an MPL Domain.\r\n\r\nMPL has two modes of operation.  One mode uses the Trickle algorithm\r\nto manage control-plane and data-plane message transmissions and is\r\napplicable for deployments with few multicast sources.  The other\r\nmode uses classic flooding.  By providing both modes and\r\nparameterization of the Trickle algorithm, an MPL implementation can\r\nbe used in a variety of multicast deployments and can trade between\r\ndissemination latency and transmission efficiency.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["6lowpan","802.15.4","IPv6","LLN","ROLL","mesh network","trickle","wsn","wireless sensor network"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7731","errata_url":null}
