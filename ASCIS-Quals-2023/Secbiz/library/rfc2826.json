This name space is a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root.  It is a technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS.  One root must be supported by a set of coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority.  It is not technically feasible for there to be more than one root in the public DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
