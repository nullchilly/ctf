This document updates\r\nRFC 4121 to allow channel bindings using algorithms negotiated based\r\non Kerberos crypto framework as defined in RFC 3961.  In addition,\r\nbecause this update makes use of the last extensible field in the\r\nKerberos client-server exchange message, extensions are defined to\r\nallow future protocol extensions.
