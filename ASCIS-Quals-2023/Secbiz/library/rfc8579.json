This simplifies client configuration.  In\r\ncontrast, the Sieve mail filtering language (RFC 5228) currently has\r\nno such capability.  This memo defines a Sieve extension that fills\r\nthis gap: it adds a test for checking whether a special-use attribute\r\nis assigned for a particular mailbox or any mailbox, and it adds the\r\nability to file messages into a mailbox identified solely by a\r\nspecial-use attribute.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["sieve","mailbox","special-use"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8579","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8579"}
