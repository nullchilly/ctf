The original Sieve \"reject\" action defined in RFC 3028\r\nrequired use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the\r\nflood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs.\r\n\r\nThis memo updates the definition of the \"reject\" action to allow\r\nmessages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines the\r\n\"ereject\" action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP\r\ntransaction, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe \"ereject\" action is intended to replace the \"reject\" action\r\nwherever possible.  The \"ereject\" action is similar to \"reject\", but\r\nwill always favor protocol-level message rejection.
