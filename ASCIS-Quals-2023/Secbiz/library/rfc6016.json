It may\r\nbe desirable to use Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to perform\r\nadmission control on the links between Customer Edge (CE) routers and\r\nProvider Edge (PE) routers.  This document specifies procedures by\r\nwhich RSVP messages traveling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be\r\nappropriately handled by PE routers so that admission control can be\r\nperformed on PE-CE links.  Optionally, admission control across the\r\nprovider's backbone may also be supported.
