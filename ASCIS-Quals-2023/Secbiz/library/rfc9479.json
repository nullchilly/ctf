Since the\r\noriginal RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g.,\r\nSegment Routing Policy and Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use\r\nof the link attribute advertisements have been defined. In cases\r\nwhere multiple applications wish to make use of these link\r\nattributes, the current advertisements do not support\r\napplication-specific values for a given attribute, nor do they\r\nsupport an indication of which applications are using the advertised\r\nvalue for a given link. This document introduces link attribute\r\nadvertisements that address both of these shortcomings.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 8919.","pub_date":"October 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC8919"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9479","errata_url":null}
