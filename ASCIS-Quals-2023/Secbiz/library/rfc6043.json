In this document, we\r\nnote that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to\r\naddress deployment scenarios built around a centralized key\r\nmanagement service.  Interest in such deployments is increasing.\r\nTherefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios\r\nare defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and\r\na ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also\r\nsupport features used by many existing applications, where the exact\r\nidentity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of the\r\ncommunication session.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["MIKEY","MIKEY-TICKET","KMS","SRTP","IMS","key management","ticket"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6309"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6043","errata_url":null}
