The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or\r\nregistrar in a fully distributed system and includes a lookup service\r\nfor Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines\r\nGlobally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow the\r\nregistrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the\r\noverlay.  After such initial contact of a Peer, the RELOAD AppAttach\r\nmethod is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through\r\nwhich SIP messages are exchanged.","pub_date":"October 2016","keywords":["p2psip","p2p","sip","reload","peer-to-peer","session initiation","distributed session management","overlay network","SIP registrar"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7904","errata_url":null}
