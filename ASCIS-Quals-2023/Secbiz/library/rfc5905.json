This document describes NTP version\r\n4 (NTPv4), which is backwards compatible with NTP version 3 (NTPv3),\r\ndescribed in RFC 1305, as well as previous versions of the protocol.\r\nNTPv4 includes a modified protocol header to accommodate the Internet\r\nProtocol version 6 address family.  NTPv4 includes fundamental\r\nimprovements in the mitigation and discipline algorithms that extend\r\nthe potential accuracy to the tens of microseconds with modern\r\nworkstations and fast LANs.  It includes a dynamic server discovery\r\nscheme, so that in many cases, specific server configuration is not\r\nrequired.  It corrects certain errors in the NTPv3 design and\r\nimplementation and includes an optional extension mechanism.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2010","keywords":["[--------]","NTP","SNTP","Synchronization"],"obsoletes":["RFC1305","RFC4330"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7822","RFC8573","RFC9109"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5905","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5905"}
