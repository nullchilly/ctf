This sub-optimal routing\r\nresults in various inefficiencies associated with packet delivery,\r\nsuch as increased delay and bottleneck links leading to traffic\r\ncongestion, which can ultimately disrupt all communications to and\r\nfrom the Mobile Network Nodes.  Additionally, with nesting of Mobile\r\nNetworks, these inefficiencies get compounded, and stalemate\r\nconditions may occur in specific dispositions.  This document\r\ninvestigates such problems and provides the motivation behind Route\r\nOptimization (RO) for NEMO.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["nemo"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4888","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4888"}
