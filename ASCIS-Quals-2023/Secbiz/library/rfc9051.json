IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message\r\nfolders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. \r\nIMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline client to\r\nresynchronize with the server. \r\n\r\nIMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming\r\nmailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently;\r\nsetting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231;\r\nsearching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and\r\nportions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of\r\nnumbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique\r\nidentifiers. \r\n\r\nIMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is\r\nhandled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in\r\nRFC 6409.","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":["IMAP4rev2","imap"],"obsoletes":["RFC3501"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9051","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9051"}
