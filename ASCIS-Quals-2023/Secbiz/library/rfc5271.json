It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a\r\nway to maintain connectivity when the mobile node (MN) moves between\r\naccess routers.  However, this handover procedure requires not only\r\nmovement detection by the MN, but also the acquisition of a new\r\nCare-of Address and Mobile IPv6 registration with the new care-of\r\naddress before the traffic can be sent or received in the target\r\nnetwork.  During this period, packets destined for the mobile node\r\nmay be lost, which may not be acceptable for a real-time application\r\nsuch as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video telephony.  This document\r\nspecifies fast handover methods in the 3G CDMA networks in order to\r\nreduce latency and packet loss during handover.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2008","keywords":["FMIP","handoff","3GPP2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5271","errata_url":null}
