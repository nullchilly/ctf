A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of\r\nusers; i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully\r\ncapable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses and that\r\nis closed to a given set of users.  Multiple VPLS services can be\r\nsupported from a single Provider Edge (PE) node.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the control plane functions of signaling\r\npseudowire labels using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP),\r\nextending RFC 4447.  It is agnostic to discovery protocols.  The data\r\nplane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing in\r\nparticular on the learning of MAC addresses.  The encapsulation of\r\nVPLS packets is described by RFC 4448.
