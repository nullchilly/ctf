This document also updates RFC 8287\r\nby clarifying that the existing \"OSPF\" code point is to be used only\r\nto indicate OSPFv2 and by defining the behavior when the Segment ID\r\nsub-TLV indicates the use of IPv6.","pub_date":"April 2022","keywords":["MPLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8287"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9214","errata_url":null}
