Also defined herein is a mechanism to organize users\r\ninto groups to support distribution of encrypted content using\r\nsymmetric cryptographic algorithms.  The mechanism uses the\r\nCryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protocol and Certificate\r\nManagement over CMS (CMC) protocol to manage the\r\nsymmetric keys.  Any member of the group can then later use this\r\ndistributed shared key to decrypt other CMS encrypted objects with\r\nthe symmetric key.  This mechanism has been developed to support\r\nSecure\/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S\/MIME) Mail List Agents \r\n(MLAs).
