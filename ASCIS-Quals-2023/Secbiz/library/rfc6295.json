The format encodes all commands that may legally appear on\r\na MIDI 1.0 DIN cable.  The format is suitable for interactive\r\napplications (such as network musical performance) and content-delivery\r\napplications (such as file streaming).  The format may be\r\nused over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines tools for\r\ngraceful recovery from packet loss.  Stream behavior, including the\r\nMIDI rendering method, may be customized during session setup.  The\r\nformat also serves as a mode for the mpeg4-generic format, to support\r\nthe MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General MIDI, Downloadable Sounds\r\nLevel 2, and Structured Audio.  This document obsoletes RFC 4695.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["[--------]","asc","content streaming","DLS 2","General MIDI","MIDI","MIDI file","MIDI file streaming","MIDI light control","MIDI rendering","MIDI ringtone","MIDI streaming MIDI sequencer","MIDI time code","MIDI timecode","MIDI Manufacturers Association","MMA mpeg4generic MPEG 4","MPEG 4 Structured Audio","MPEG 4 Synthetic Coding","MTC","musical notes","network musical performance","recovery journal","Show Control","sonification","ringtone","rtpmidi","RTP","RTP MIDI","SMPTE time code","SMPTE timecode","Standard MIDI Files","XMF"],"obsoletes":["RFC4695"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6295","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6295"}
