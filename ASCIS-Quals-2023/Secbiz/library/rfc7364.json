A\r\nkey multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one\r\ntenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant.  Another\r\nrequirement is address space isolation so that different tenants can\r\nuse the same address space within different virtual networks.\r\nTraffic and address space isolation is achieved by assigning one or\r\nmore virtual networks to each tenant, where traffic within a virtual\r\nnetwork can only cross into another virtual network in a controlled\r\nfashion (e.g., via a configured router and\/or a security gateway).\r\nAdditional functionality is required to provision virtual networks,\r\nassociating a virtual machine's network interface(s) with the\r\nappropriate virtual network and maintaining that association as the\r\nvirtual machine is activated, migrated, and\/or deactivated.  Use of\r\nan overlay-based approach enables scalable deployment on large\r\nnetwork infrastructures.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7364","errata_url":null}
