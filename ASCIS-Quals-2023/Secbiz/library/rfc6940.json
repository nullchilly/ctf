A\r\nP2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage\r\nand messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form\r\nthe overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session\r\nInitiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other\r\napplications with similar requirements by defining new usages that\r\nspecify the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular\r\napplication.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate\r\nenrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is\r\na fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access\r\nfrom \"client\" nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data\r\nfor others.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":["p2p","dht","p2psip","chord","peer to peer"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6940","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6940"}
