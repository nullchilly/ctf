The document specifies an\r\nend-to-end acknowledgement congestion control mechanism for TCP that\r\nuses participation from both TCP hosts: the TCP data sender and the\r\nTCP data receiver.  The TCP data sender detects lost or Explicit\r\nCongestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP data\r\nreceiver the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse\r\npath from the data receiver to the data sender.  The TCP data receiver sends\r\nroughly one ACK packet for every R data packets received.  This mechanism is\r\nbased on the acknowledgement congestion control in the Datagram Congestion\r\nControl Protocol's (DCCP's) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) 2.  This\r\nacknowledgement congestion control mechanism is being specified for further\r\nevaluation by the network community.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["ackcc"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5690","errata_url":null}
