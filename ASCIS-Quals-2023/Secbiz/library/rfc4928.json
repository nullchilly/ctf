This document makes best practice\r\nrecommendations for anyone defining an application to run over an\r\nMPLS network that wishes to avoid the reordering that can result from\r\ntransmission of different packets from the same flow over multiple\r\ndifferent equal cost paths.  These recommendations rely on inspection\r\nof the IP version number field in packets.  Despite the heuristic\r\nnature of the recommendations, they provide a relatively safe way\r\nto operate MPLS networks, even if future allocations of IP version\r\nnumbers were made for some purpose.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"June 2007","keywords":["[--------|b]","ecmp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7274"],"see_also":["BCP0128"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4928","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4928"}
