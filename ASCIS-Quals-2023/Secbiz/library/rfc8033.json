As more and more\r\ninteractive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video\r\nstreaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high\r\nlatency and latency variation degrade application performance.  There\r\nis a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes\r\nthat can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide\r\ndesirable quality of service to users.\r\n\r\nThis document presents a lightweight active queue management design\r\ncalled \"PIE\" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can\r\neffectively control the average queuing latency to a target value.\r\nSimulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results\r\nhave shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link\r\nutilization under various congestion situations.  The design does not\r\nrequire per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and\r\nis simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":["active queue management","AQM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8033","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8033"}
