As\r\na result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from\r\nempirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This\r\ndocument, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of\r\nexisting literature on discovering and using network topology\r\ninformation for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.  This \r\ndocument is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["Peer-to-Peer","topology estimation","Internet coordinate system"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6029","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6029"}
