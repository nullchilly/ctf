The bindings set up by\r\nthis procedure are used to filter packets with forged source IP\r\naddresses.  This mechanism complements BCP 38 (RFC 2827) ingress\r\nfiltering, providing finer-grained source IP address validation.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["SAVI-DHCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7513","errata_url":null}
