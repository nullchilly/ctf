This\r\ndocument describes the use of keys derived from an IKEv2 security\r\nassociation (SA) as the shared key in OWAMP or TWAMP.  If the shared\r\nkey can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, OWAMP or TWAMP can support\r\ncertificate-based key exchange; this would allow for more operational\r\nflexibility and efficiency.  The key derivation presented in this\r\ndocument can also facilitate automatic key management.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4656","RFC5357"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7717","errata_url":null}
