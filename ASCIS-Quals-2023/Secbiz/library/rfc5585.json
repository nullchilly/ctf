It is intended for those who are adopting, developing,\r\nor deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility\r\nfor transmitting a message, in a way that can be verified by a\r\nrecipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating\r\nsending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A message can\r\ncontain multiple signatures from the same or different organizations\r\ninvolved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level digital\r\nsignature authentication framework for email, using public-key\r\ncryptography, with the domain name service as its key server\r\ntechnology (RFC 4871).  This permits verification of a responsible\r\norganization, as well as the integrity of the message contents.  DKIM\r\nalso enables a mechanism that permits potential email signers to\r\npublish information about their email signing practices; this will\r\npermit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.\r\nDKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global\r\ncontrol of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".  This memo provides information \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2009","keywords":["Email","Electroni Mail","Internet Mail","Message Verification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5585","errata_url":null}
