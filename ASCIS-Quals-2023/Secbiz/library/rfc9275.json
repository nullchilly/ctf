It extends the ALTO cost map and ALTO\r\nproperty map services so that an application can decide to which\r\nendpoint(s) to connect based not only on numerical\/ordinal cost\r\nvalues but also on fine-grained abstract information regarding the\r\npaths. This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted\r\nby specific components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g.,\r\nthey may infer that several paths share common links and prevent\r\ntraffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This extension introduces\r\na new abstraction called the \"Abstract Network Element\" (ANE) to\r\nrepresent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of\r\nANEs. Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph\r\nrepresentation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic\r\noptimization among endpoints.","pub_date":"September 2022","keywords":["network visibility","abstract network element","shared bottleneck"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9275","errata_url":null}
