The\r\nhost may check for link change (i.e., determine whether a link change\r\nhas occurred), and then, based on the result, it can automatically\r\ndecide whether its IP configuration is still valid.  During\r\nlink identity detection, the host may also collect necessary\r\ninformation to initiate a new IP configuration if the\r\nIP subnet has changed.  In this memo, this procedure is called\r\nDetecting Network Attachment (DNA).  DNA schemes should be precise,\r\nsufficiently fast, secure, and of limited signaling.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["dna","detecting attachment links","change detection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4135","errata_url":null}
