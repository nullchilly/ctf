It then expands on the requirements for such a\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nManual configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in\r\nmany such cases.  In other cases, the IP addresses of endpoints\r\nchange, or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static\r\nconfiguration impossible.  The Auto-Discovery VPN solution will\r\naddress these requirements.","pub_date":"September 2013","keywords":["IPsec","Overlay","SDN","IKE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7018","errata_url":null}
