This is sufficient in environments\r\nwhere the location of a Device can be determined based on its IP\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nTwo additional use cases are addressed by this document.  In the\r\nfirst, location configuration requires additional or alternative\r\nidentifiers from the source IP address provided in the request.  In\r\nthe second, an entity other than the Device requests the location of\r\nthe Device.\r\n\r\nThis document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request\r\nmessage to carry Device identifiers.  Privacy and security\r\nconsiderations describe the conditions where requests containing\r\nidentifiers are permitted.
