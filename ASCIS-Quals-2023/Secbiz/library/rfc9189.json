This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 with GOST\r\nalgorithms so that implementers can produce interoperable\r\nimplementations. \r\n\r\nThis specification facilitates implementations that aim to support\r\nthe GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement of\r\nthe cipher suites, signature algorithms, supported groups, and\r\ncertificate types.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":["GOST","cipher suite","TLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9189","errata_url":null}
