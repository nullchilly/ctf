This requires advertising these\r\ncapabilities within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  For that\r\npurpose, this document specifies Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and\r\nIntermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS) traffic engineering\r\nextensions for the advertisement of control plane and data plane\r\ntraffic engineering node capabilities.
