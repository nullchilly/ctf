However, not all\r\ntelephone calls use Internet signaling protocols, and some calls use\r\nthem for only part of their signaling path, while some cannot\r\nreliably deliver SIP header fields end-to-end. This document\r\ndescribes use cases that require the delivery of PASSporT objects\r\noutside of the signaling path, and defines architectures and\r\nsemantics to provide this functionality.","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":["SIP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8816","errata_url":null}
