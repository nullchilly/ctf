In addition to IEEE Std 802.15.4, various link-layer\r\ntechnologies are used as examples, such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave),\r\nBluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE), Digital Enhanced Cordless\r\nTelecommunications - Ultra Low Energy (DECT-ULE), Master-Slave\/Token\r\nPassing (MS\/TP), Near Field Communication (NFC), and Power Line\r\nCommunication (PLC). This document targets an audience who would like\r\nto understand and evaluate running end-to-end IPv6 over the\r\nconstrained-node networks for local or Internet connectivity.","pub_date":"September 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9453","errata_url":null}
