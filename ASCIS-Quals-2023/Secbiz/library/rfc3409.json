The purpose of this document is to support the incorporation of robust header compression algorithms, as specified in the ROHC working group, into different systems such as those specified by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 3GPP Project 2 (3GPP2), European Technical Standards Institute (ETSI), etc.  This document covers only lower layer guidelines for compression of RTP\/UDP\/IP and UDP\/IP headers as specified in [RFC3095].  Both general guidelines and guidelines specific for cellular systems are discussed in this document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
