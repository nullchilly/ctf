This is done using the Alert-Info header\r\nfield.  However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a\r\nspecific network resource with specific rendering properties.  There\r\nis currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the\r\nsemantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the\r\nalerting signal, without being tied to a particular rendering.  To\r\novercome these limitations and support new applications, a new family\r\nof URNs for use in Alert-Info header fields (and situations with\r\nsimilar requirements) is defined in this specification.\r\n\r\nThis document normatively updates RFC 3261, which defines the Session\r\nInitiation Protocol (SIP).  It changes the usage of the Alert-Info\r\nheader field defined in RFC 3261 by additionally allowing its use in\r\nany non-100 provisional response to INVITE.  This document also\r\npermits proxies to add or remove an Alert-Info header field and to\r\nadd or remove Alert-Info header field values.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3261"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7462","errata_url":null}
