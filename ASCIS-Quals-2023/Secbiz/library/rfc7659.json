The new MIB module defined in this document, NATV2-MIB, is\r\nintended to replace module NAT-MIB (RFC 4008).  NATV2-MIB is not\r\nbackwards compatible with NAT-MIB, for reasons given in the text of\r\nthis document.  A companion document deprecates all objects in\r\nNAT-MIB.  NATV2-MIB can be used for the monitoring of NAT instances\r\non a device capable of NAT function.  Compliance levels are defined\r\nfor three application scenarios: basic NAT, pooled NAT, and\r\ncarrier-grade NAT (CGN).","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["MIB","management information base","NATV2-MIB","NAT-MIB","basic nat","pooled nat","carrier-grade nat","CGN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7659","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7659"}
