It provides motivations\r\nfor the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including\r\nthe context information required for all metrics.  The memo first\r\ndefines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for\r\nsample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several\r\nuseful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design.\r\nAdditional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the\r\ndistance between separate occurrences.  We then define a metric\r\noriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP.  Several\r\nexamples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are\r\nincluded.  An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating\r\norder with packet fragmentation.
