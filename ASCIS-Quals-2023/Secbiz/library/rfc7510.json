The MPLS-\r\nin-UDP encapsulation technology must only be deployed within a single\r\nnetwork (with a single network operator) or networks of an adjacent\r\nset of cooperating network operators where traffic is managed to\r\navoid congestion, rather than over the Internet where congestion\r\ncontrol is required.  Usage restrictions apply to MPLS-in-UDP usage\r\nfor traffic that is not congestion controlled and to UDP zero\r\nchecksum usage with IPv6.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["MPLS","UDP","Tunnel","Checksum","encapsulation","multipath","ECMP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7510","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7510"}
