This document defines an optional extension to the\r\nLabel Distribution Protocol (LDP) that enables the binding between\r\nPWs and the underlying Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels.  The\r\nextension applies to both single-segment and multi-segment PWs.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7965","errata_url":null}
