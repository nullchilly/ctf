A node steers a\r\npacket through a controlled set of instructions called \"segments\" by\r\nprepending the packet with an SR header.\r\n\r\nThe segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of SR raises\r\nadditional considerations for connectivity verification and fault\r\nisolation for a Label Switched Path (LSP) within an SR architecture.\r\nThis document illustrates the problem and defines extensions to\r\nperform LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and\r\nIGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":["MPLS","LSP Ping","SPRING","Segment Routing","SR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8690","RFC9214"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8287","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8287"}
