Still, the\r\nsignaling layer protocol above GIST itself may require separate\r\nauthorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a\r\ncertain kind of service or resources.  This document presents a\r\ngeneric model and object formats for session authorization within the\r\nNSIS signaling layer protocols.  The goal of session authorization is\r\nto allow the exchange of information between network elements in\r\norder to authorize the use of resources for a service and to\r\ncoordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes.\r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["[--------]","Next Steps in Signaling","gist","General Internet Signaling Transport"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5981","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5981"}
