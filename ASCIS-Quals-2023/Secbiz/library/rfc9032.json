Routers in a TSCH network transmit Enhanced\r\nBeacon (EB) frames to announce the presence of the network.  This\r\ndocument provides a mechanism by which additional information\r\ncritical for new nodes (pledges) and long-sleeping nodes may be\r\ncarried within the EB in order to conserve use of broadcast\r\nopportunities.","pub_date":"May 2021","keywords":["BRSKI","enroll","zero-touch","DODAG balancing","LLN balancing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9032","errata_url":null}
