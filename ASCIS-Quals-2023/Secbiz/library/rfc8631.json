Often, these sets of resources are referred to as \"Web               \r\nservices\" or \"Web APIs\".  This specification defines link relations\r\nthat represent relationships from Web services or APIs to resources\r\nthat provide documentation, descriptions, metadata, or status\r\ninformation for these resources.  Documentation is primarily intended\r\nfor human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for\r\nautomated consumers.  Metadata provides information about a service's\r\ncontext.  This specification also defines a link relation to identify\r\nstatus resources that are used to represent information about service\r\nstatus.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":["API","Documentation","Description","Metadata","Status"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8631","errata_url":null}
