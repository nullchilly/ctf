Abstract

   This document describes the assignment of one of the reserved label
   values defined in <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a> (MPLS label stack encoding) to the
   'Operation and Maintenance (OAM) Alert Label' that is used by user-
   plane Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) OAM functions
   for identification of MPLS OAM packets.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document describes the assignment of one of the reserved label
   values defined in <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a> (MPLS label stack encoding [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;MPLS label stack encoding&quot;">2</a>]) to the
   'OAM Alert Label' that is used by user-plane MPLS OAM functions for
   identification of MPLS OAM packets as described in the ITU-T
   Recommendation Y.1711 [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>] (on MPLS OAM functions).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. OAM functions</span>

   MPLS OAM (Operation and Maintenance) functions provide necessary
   tools for network operators to operate and maintain the networks.
   MPLS OAM functionality is required at the MPLS layer, and more
   specifically at each MPLS level, independent of OAM functionality
   provided by the lower layers (SONET/SDH, etc.).  The objectives of
   the OAM functions include the following:

   -  Defect and failure detection: Defect/failures affecting the
      transport of user information are detected by continuous or
      periodic checking.  As a result, maintenance event information or
      appropriate alarms will be produced.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3429">RFC 3429</a>           OAM Alert Label for OAM Functions       November 2002</span>


   -  Reporting the defect/failure information: Defect information is
      given to other management entities (e.g., Operation Support
      System) in order to provide the appropriate indications to the
      maintenance staff for maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS)
      level offered to customers.

   -  Defect/failure localization: Determination by internal or external
      test systems of a failed entity is performed if defect information
      is insufficient.

   -  Performance monitoring: Performance (packet losses, transfer
      delay, bit errors, etc.) of the user information transport is
      measured in order to estimate the transport integrity.

   The user-plane MPLS OAM mechanisms as described in the ITU-T
   Recommendation Y.1711 [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>] uses a special label called 'OAM Alert
   Label' to differentiate OAM packets from the normal user packets.
   One of the reserved label values defined in <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a> (MPLS label
   stack encoding [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;MPLS label stack encoding&quot;">2</a>]) is assigned to 'OAM Alert Label'.  A value of 14
   is used for this purpose.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>. MPLS OAM work in ITU-T SG13</span>

   ITU-T Study Group 13, Question 3/13 is progressing work on user-plane
   MPLS OAM and has produced the following documents:

   (1) Recommendation Y.1710 (Requirements for OAM functionality for
       MPLS networks) [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Requirements for OAM functionality for MPLS networks&quot;">3</a>]

   (2) Corrigendum 1 to Recommendation Y.1710 [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]

   (3) Recommendation Y.1711 (OAM mechanisms for MPLS networks) [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>]

   (4) Draft Recommendation Y.1720 (Protection switching for MPLS
       networks) [<a href="#ref-6" title="&quot;Protection switching for MPLS networks&quot;">6</a>] relies on OAM mechanisms in Y.1711, under last call
       as of Nov. 2002.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>. Considerations on penultimate hop popping (PHP)</span>

   In response to concerns raised during IETF meetings and in related
   discussions, this section provides an explanation on how MPLS OAM
   functions defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1711 [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>] are applied to
   MPLS networks where PHP is in effect.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a> Scope of ITU-T Recommendation Y.1711</span>

   The scope of ITU-T Recommendation Y.1711 includes application to both
   non-PHP and PHP cases as quoted below [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>].

   "1 Scope
   This Recommendation provides mechanisms for user-plane OAM (Operation
   and Maintenance) functionality in MPLS networks according to the
   requirements and principles given in Recommendation Y.1710.  OAM
   functions specified in this Recommendation can be applied to both
   non-PHP and PHP cases unless otherwise stated.  The current version
   of this recommendation is designed primarily to support
   point-to-point and multipoint-to-point explicit routed LSPs
   (ER-LSPs)."

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a> Applicability of MPLS OAM to PHP</span>

   There are two cases where PHP is used:

   Case 1: The ultimate node is an MPLS LSR, and implements both MPLS
   control-plane and data-plane, but is not able to perform 2 lookups at
   line rate.  So it asks the penultimate node to pop the top label
   (rather than swapping it), using the MPLS reserved label 3 (implicit
   null label) as per defined in <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;MPLS label stack encoding&quot;">2</a>].

   Case 2: The ultimate node has no MPLS label look up and processing
   capability and does not recognize labeled packets.  This node asks
   for PHP, using the MPLS reserved label 3 (implicit null label) as
   defined in <a href="./rfc3032">RFC 3032</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;MPLS label stack encoding&quot;">2</a>].

   Currently, MPLS OAM functions defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1711
   [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>] can only be applied to Case 1.  The next subsection describes the
   node behavior in Case 1.  Application for Case 2 needs further study.
   Also, application to carrier supporting carrier scenarios is for
   future study.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-5.3" href="#section-5.3">5.3</a> Node behavior when OAM functions are activated</span>

   Where the ultimate LSR is an MPLS LSR and PHP is in effect, the
   penultimate LSR pops the top label and forwards the OAM packet (with
   the OAM label and the OAM payload intact) to the ultimate LSR [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture&quot;">5</a>].

   -  If the ultimate LSR supports MPLS OAM, it understands that a
      received packet with an OAM label on top is an OAM packet, since
      the original top label has been removed by the penultimate LSR.
      It also knows the ingress LSR that originated the MPLS OAM packet
      from the TTSI (Trail Termination Source Identifier) value of the




<span class="grey">Ohta                         Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>

      received MPLS OAM packet.  TTSI is a unique identifier for ingress
      LSR that is contained in MPLS OAM packets (see ITU-T
      Recommendation Y.1711 [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>]).

   -  If the ultimate LSR does not support MPLS OAM, the OAM packet is
      discarded as per <a href="./rfc3031#section-3.18">section&nbsp;3.18 of RFC 3031</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title="&quot;Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture&quot;">5</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   The IANA has reserved the use of the MPLS label value of 14 as the
   'OAM Alert Label'.  See <a href="#section-3">section 3</a> for additional information.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   This document does not raise any security issues that are not already
   present in either the MPLS architecture or in the architecture of the
   network layer protocol contained within the encapsulation.

   OAM functions could enhance the security of MPLS networks.  For
   example, Connectivity Verification (CV) function defined in ITU-T
   Recommendation Y.1711 [<a href="#ref-1" title="&quot;OAM mechanism for MPLS networks&quot;">1</a>] can detect mis-connections, and therefore
   can prevent customers' traffic being exposed to other customers.
