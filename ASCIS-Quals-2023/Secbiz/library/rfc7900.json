However, it is sometimes desirable to\r\nallow multicast traffic whose source is in one VPN to be received by\r\nsystems that are in another VPN.  This is known as a \"Multicast VPN                   \r\n(MVPN) extranet\".  This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by\r\nspecifying the procedures that are necessary in order to provide\r\nextranet MVPN service.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6513","RFC6514","RFC6625"],"updated_by":["RFC8534"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7900","errata_url":null}
