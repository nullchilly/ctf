This document also describes a Fully-Specified\r\nFEC Scheme for the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8)\r\nwhen there is no encoding symbol group.  Finally, in the context of\r\nthe Under-Specified Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme (FEC Encoding\r\nID 129), this document assigns an FEC Instance ID to the special case\r\nof Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8).\r\n\r\nReed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable\r\n(MDS) codes, i.e., they enable a receiver to recover the k source\r\nsymbols from any set of k received symbols.  The schemes described\r\nhere are compatible with the implementation from Luigi Rizzo.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"April 2009","keywords":["[--------]","maximum distance separable","MDS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5510","errata_url":null}
