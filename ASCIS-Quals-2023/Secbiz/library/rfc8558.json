Hardie, Ed."],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"10","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IAB","abstract":"This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path\r\nelements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and\r\nexplicit signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of\r\nwell-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these\r\nare visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes\r\nsetting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals\r\nby those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these\r\nmessages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals.\r\nOften, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the\r\nmessages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that\r\nnetwork elements along the path receive these signals, this document\r\nrecommends explicit signals be used.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8558","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8558"}
