In so doing, this document aims to\r\nclearly distinguish between requirements for pNFS as a whole and\r\nthose specifically directed to the pNFS file layout.  The lack of a\r\nclear separation between the two sets of requirements has been\r\ntroublesome for those specifying and evaluating new layout types.  In\r\nthis regard, this document updates RFC 5661.\r\n","pub_date":"August 2018","keywords":["NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5661"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8434","errata_url":null}
