However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the\r\n6LoWPAN format specification defines how mesh topologies could be\r\nobtained and maintained.  Thus, it should be considered how 6LoWPAN\r\nformation and multi-hop routing could be supported.\r\n\r\nThis document provides the problem statement and design space for\r\n6LoWPAN routing.  It defines the routing requirements for 6LoWPANs,\r\nconsidering the low-power and other particular characteristics of the\r\ndevices and links.  The purpose of this document is not to recommend\r\nspecific solutions but to provide general, layer-agnostic guidelines\r\nabout the design of 6LoWPAN routing that can lead to further analysis\r\nand protocol design.  This document is intended as input to groups\r\nworking on routing protocols relevant to 6LoWPANs, such as the IETF\r\nROLL WG.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; \r\nit is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["WSN","Sensor Network","Wireless Sensor Network","WSN for Wireless Sensor Network","L3 Mesh for Layer 3 Mesh Network","Routing Protocol","Subnet Routing","ieee 802.15.4","LLN","Low Power","radio 802.15.4","powerline","ISA100.11a","RFC 4944"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6606","errata_url":null}
