This method uses a \"peer model\", in which the customers'\r\nedge routers (CE routers) send their routes to the Service\r\nProvider's edge routers (PE routers); there is no \"overlay\" visible\r\nto the customer's routing algorithm, and CE routers at different\r\nsites do not peer with each other.  Data packets are tunneled through\r\nthe backbone, so that the core routers do not need to know the VPN\r\nroutes.
