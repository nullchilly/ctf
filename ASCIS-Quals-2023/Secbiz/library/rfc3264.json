In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer\/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.  The offer\/answer model is used by protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
