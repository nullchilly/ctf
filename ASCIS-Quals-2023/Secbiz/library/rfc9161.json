The EVPN Proxy ARP\/ND\r\nfunction and the ARP\/ND Extended Community help operators of Internet\r\nExchange Points, Data Centers, and other networks deal with IPv4 and\r\nIPv6 address resolution issues associated with large Broadcast\r\nDomains by reducing and even suppressing the flooding produced by\r\naddress resolution in the EVPN network.","pub_date":"January 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7432"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9161","errata_url":null}
