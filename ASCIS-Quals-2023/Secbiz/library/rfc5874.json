This format reports which document has changed and its\r\nformer and new entity tags.  It can report the differences between\r\nversions of the document, using an XML patch format.  It can report\r\nexisting element and attribute content when versions of an XCAP\r\nserver document change.  XCAP diff documents can be delivered to diff\r\nclients using a number of means, including a Session Initiation\r\nProtocol (SIP) event package.
