These abilities have several benefits:\r\nReceivers can provide feedback to Domain Owners about the use of\r\ntheir domains; this feedback can provide valuable insight about the\r\nmanagement of internal operations and the presence of external domain\r\nname abuse.\r\n\r\nDMARC does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of\r\nauthenticated email.  DMARC is a mechanism for policy distribution\r\nthat enables increasingly strict handling of messages that fail\r\nauthentication checks, ranging from no action, through altered\r\ndelivery, up to message rejection.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":["domain","email","security","messaging","dkim","spf","authentication","reporting","conformance"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8553","RFC8616"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7489","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7489"}
