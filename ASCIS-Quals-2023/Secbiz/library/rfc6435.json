The lock\r\nfunction enables an operator to lock a transport path such that it\r\ndoes not carry client traffic, but can continue to carry OAM messages\r\nand may carry test traffic.  The loopback function allows an operator\r\nto set a specific node on the transport path into loopback mode such\r\nthat it returns all received data.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the lock function for MPLS networks and\r\ndescribes how the loopback function operates in MPLS networks.\r\n\r\nThis document updates Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of RFC 6371.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":["[--------]","oam","operations","administration","and maintenance"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6371"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6435","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6435"}
