It can\r\nbe used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated\r\nto it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between\r\ntwo endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.\r\nSTUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special\r\nbehavior from them.\r\n\r\nSTUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool\r\nto be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5389.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["SIPs"],"obsoletes":["RFC5389"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8489","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8489"}
