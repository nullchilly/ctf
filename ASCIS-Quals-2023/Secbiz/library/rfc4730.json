The kpml Event Package may be used to\r\nsupport applications consistent with the principles defined in the\r\ndocument titled \"A Framework for Application Interaction in the\r\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)\".  The event package uses SUBSCRIBE\r\nmessages and allows for XML documents that define and describe filter\r\nspecifications for capturing key presses (DTMF Tones) entered at a\r\npresentation-free User Interface SIP User Agent (UA).  The event\r\npackage uses NOTIFY messages and allows for XML documents to report\r\nthe captured key presses (DTMF tones), consistent with the filter\r\nspecifications, to an Application Server.  The scope of this package\r\nis for collecting supplemental key presses or mid-call key presses\r\n(triggers).
