The bandwidth of such links is sensitive\r\nto the external environment (e.g., climate).  Availability is\r\ntypically used to describe these links when doing network planning.\r\nThis document introduces an optional Bandwidth Availability TLV in\r\nRSVP-TE signaling.  This extension can be used to set up a GMPLS\r\nLabel Switched Path (LSP) in conjunction with the Ethernet\r\nSENDER_TSPEC object.","pub_date":"August 2019","keywords":["GMPLS","RSVP-TE","microwave","variable bandwidth link"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8625","errata_url":null}
