This mechanism is\r\napplicable to the mobile node's inter-MAG (Mobility Access Gateway)\r\nhandover while using a single interface or different interfaces.  The\r\nhandover problem space using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol is\r\nanalyzed and the use of transient binding cache entries at the local\r\nmobility anchor is described.  The specified extension to the Proxy\r\nMobile IPv6 protocol ensures optimized forwarding of downlink as well\r\nas uplink packets between mobile nodes and the network infrastructure\r\nand avoids superfluous packet forwarding delay or even packet loss.\r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["PMIP","handover optimization","handover delay","tBCE","late path switch","forwarding","make-before-break","dual radio handover","single radio handover","transient binding cache entry"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6058","errata_url":null}
