This document explains a\r\nnumber of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as\r\nwell as corresponding trade-offs. The objective is to help embedded\r\ndevelopers with decisions on which TCP features to use.","pub_date":"March 2021","keywords":["constrained node networks","CNNs","HTTP","CoAP","MQTT","6LoWPAN","6Lo","IEEE 802.15.4","Bluetooth Low Energy","Contiki","uIP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9006","errata_url":null}
