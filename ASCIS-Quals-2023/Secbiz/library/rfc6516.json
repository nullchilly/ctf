It also contains an option that\r\nallows UDP-based messages, known as Selective Provider\r\nMulticast Service Interface (S-PMSI) Join messages, to be used to bind\r\nparticular customer multicast flows to particular tunnels through a\r\nservice provider's network.  This document extends the MVPN\r\nspecification (RFC 6513) so that these options can be used when the customer\r\nmulticast flows are IPv6 flows.
