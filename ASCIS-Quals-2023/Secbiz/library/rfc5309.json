It is important to\r\nidentify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies,\r\nflooding link state database packets, and representing the circuit\r\ntopologically.  This document describes a simple mechanism to treat\r\nthe broadcast network as a point-to-point connection from the\r\nstandpoint of IP routing.
