GSM is a second generation mobile network standard.\r\nThe EAP-SIM mechanism specifies enhancements to GSM authentication\r\nand key agreement whereby multiple authentication triplets can be\r\ncombined to create authentication responses and session keys of\r\ngreater strength than the individual GSM triplets.  The mechanism\r\nalso includes network authentication, user anonymity support, result\r\nindications, and a fast re-authentication procedure.
