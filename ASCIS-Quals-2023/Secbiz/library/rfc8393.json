This is achieved by defining a new\r\nNSH \"Next Protocol\" type value of \"None\".\r\n\r\nThis document illustrates some of the functions that may be achieved\r\nor enhanced by this mechanism, but it does not provide an exhaustive\r\nlist of use cases, nor is it intended to be definitive about the\r\nfunctions it describes.  It is expected that other documents will\r\ndescribe specific use cases in more detail and will define the\r\nprotocol mechanics for each use case.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["Service Function Chaining","Network Service Header","Metadata"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8393","errata_url":null}
