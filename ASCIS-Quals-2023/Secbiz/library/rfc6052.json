It defines a well-known prefix\r\nfor use in algorithmic translations, while allowing organizations to\r\nalso use network-specific prefixes when appropriate.  Algorithmic\r\ntranslation is used in IPv4\/IPv6 translators, as well as other types\r\nof proxies and gateways (e.g., for DNS) used in IPv4\/IPv6 scenarios.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["[--------]","address","prefix","transition","translation","NAT","NAT64","BEHAVE","stateless","stateful"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4291"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6052","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6052"}
