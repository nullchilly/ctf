It extends the Common\r\nPolicy authorization framework to provide location-specific access\r\ncontrol.  More specifically, this document defines condition elements\r\nspecific to location information in order to restrict access to data\r\nbased on the current location of the Target.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this document defines two algorithms for reducing the\r\ngranularity of returned location information.  The first algorithm is\r\ndefined for usage with civic location information, whereas the other\r\none applies to geodetic location information.  Both algorithms come\r\nwith limitations.  There are circumstances where the amount of\r\nlocation obfuscation provided is less than what is desired.  These\r\nalgorithms might not be appropriate for all application domains.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":["[--------]","Authorization Policy","Location Privacy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6772","errata_url":null}
