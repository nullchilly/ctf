Lightpath provisioning\r\nin WSONs requires a Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process.\r\nFrom a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the\r\nprocess of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a\r\npath and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light\r\npath computation.  Requirements for PCEP extensions in support of\r\noptical impairments will be addressed in a separate document.","pub_date":"February 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7449","errata_url":null}
