This document\r\nprovides guidelines for the optional functionality of Internet Fax\r\nGateways.  In this context, an \"offramp gateway\" provides facsimile\r\ndata transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an \"onramp\r\ngateway\" provides data transmission from GSTN fax to i-fax.  The\r\nrecommendations in this document apply to the integrated service\r\nincluding Internet Fax terminals, computers with i-fax software on\r\nthe Internet, and GSTN fax terminals on the GSTN.\r\n\r\nThis document supplements the recommendation for minimal features of\r\nan Internet Fax Gateway.  In particular, it covers techniques for\r\ndropping duplicated fax messages, automatic fax re-transmission,\r\nerror, return notice, and log handling, and possible authorization\r\nmethods by DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) for onramp gateways.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2005","keywords":["general switched telephone network acsimile service","gstn fax","internet fax service","i-fax","offramp gateway","onramp gateway"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4161","errata_url":null}
