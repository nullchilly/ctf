A set of Redundant PWs is configured between\r\nProvider Edge (PE) nodes in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW)\r\napplications or between Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes in\r\nMulti-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) applications.\r\n\r\nIn order for the PE\/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use\r\nfor forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is\r\ndefined.  This bit indicates a Preferential Forwarding status with a\r\nvalue of active or standby for each PW in a redundant set.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes\r\nto coordinate a switchover operation of the PW.\r\n\r\nFinally, this document updates RFC 4447 by adding details to the\r\nhandling of the PW status code bits in the PW Status TLV.","pub_date":"February 2013","keywords":["PW redundancy","active PW","standby PW","primary PW","secondary PW","PW precedence"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4447"],"updated_by":["RFC7771"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6870","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6870"}
