Fast handover base\r\noperations do not affect multicast communication and, hence, do not\r\naccelerate handover management for native multicast listeners.  Many\r\nmulticast applications like IPTV or conferencing, though, comprise\r\ndelay-sensitive, real-time traffic and will benefit from fast\r\nhandover completion.  This document specifies extension of the Mobile\r\nIPv6 Fast Handovers (FMIPv6) and the Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile\r\nIPv6 (PFMIPv6) protocols to include multicast traffic management in\r\nfast handover operations.  This multicast support is provided first\r\nat the control plane by management of rapid context transfer between\r\naccess routers and second at the data plane by optional fast traffic\r\nforwarding that may include buffering.  An FMIPv6 access router\r\nindicates support for multicast using an updated Proxy Router\r\nAdvertisements message format.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5568, \"Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers\".","pub_date":"November 2014","keywords":["Multicast","Mobility","IPv6","PIM","MLD","Group Communication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5568"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7411","errata_url":null}
