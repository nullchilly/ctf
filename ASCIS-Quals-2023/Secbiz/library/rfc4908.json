Since the behaviors of fixed and mobile networks\r\ndiffer, distinct architectures for each have been discussed and\r\nproposed.  This document proposes a common architecture for both\r\nmobile and fixed networking environments, using mobile IP (RFC 3775)\r\nand Network Mobility (NEMO; RFC 3963).  The proposed architecture\r\nrequires a modification of mobile IP and NEMO so that multiple Care-of\r\nAddresses (CoAs) can be used.  In addition, multiple Home Agents (HAs)\r\nthat are located in different places are required for redundancy.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2007","keywords":["care-of addresses"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4908","errata_url":null}
