GMPLS has been developed to control and operate different\r\nkinds of network elements, such as conventional routers, switches,\r\nDense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop\r\nMultiplexers (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross-\r\nconnects (OXCs), etc.  These physically diverse devices differ\r\ndrastically from one another in dynamic provisioning ability.  At the\r\nsame time, the need for dynamically provisioned connections is\r\nincreasing because optical networks are being deployed in metro\r\nareas.  As different applications have varied requirements in the\r\nprovisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to\r\ndefine standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance\r\nof networks and application needs can be mapped to each other.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a series of performance metrics to evaluate\r\nthe dynamic Label Switched Path (LSP) provisioning performance in\r\nGMPLS networks, specifically the dynamic LSP setup\/release\r\nperformance.  These metrics can be used to characterize the features\r\nof GMPLS networks in LSP dynamic provisioning.
