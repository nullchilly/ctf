For certain applications the\r\nconfiguration of the PW Type is most easily accomplished by\r\nconfiguring this information at just one PW endpoint.  In any form of\r\nLDP-based signaling, each PW endpoint must initiate the creation of a\r\nunidirectional LSP.  In order to allow the initiation of these two\r\nLSPs to remain independent, a means is needed for allowing the PW endpoint\r\n(lacking a priori knowledge of the PW Type) to initiate the creation of\r\nan LSP.  This document defines a Wildcard PW Type to\r\nsatisfy this need.
