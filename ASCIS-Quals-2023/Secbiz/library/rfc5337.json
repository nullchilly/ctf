However, the existing Draft Standards\r\n(RFC 3461, RFC 3462, RFC 3464) are presently limited to US-ASCII text\r\nin the machine-readable portions of the protocol.  This specification\r\nadds a new address type for international email addresses so an\r\noriginal recipient address with non-US-ASCII characters can be\r\ncorrectly preserved even after downgrading.  This also provides\r\nupdated content return media types for delivery status notifications\r\nand message disposition notifications to support use of the new\r\naddress type.\r\n\r\nThis document experimentally extends RFC 3461, RFC 3464, and RFC\r\n3798.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","EAI","DSN","SMTP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6533"],"updates":["RFC3461","RFC3462","RFC3464","RFC3798"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5337","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5337"}
