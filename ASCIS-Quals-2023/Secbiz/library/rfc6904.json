However, RTP header extensions may\r\ncarry sensitive information for which participants in multimedia\r\nsessions want confidentiality.  This document provides a mechanism,\r\nextending the mechanisms of SRTP, to selectively encrypt RTP header\r\nextensions in SRTP.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 3711, the Secure Real-time Transport\r\nProtocol specification, to require that all future SRTP encryption\r\ntransforms specify how RTP header extensions are to be encrypted.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":["real-time transport protocol","rtp","header extensions","security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3711"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6904","errata_url":null}
