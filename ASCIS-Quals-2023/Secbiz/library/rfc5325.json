Farrell"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"23","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IRTF","abstract":"This document describes the motivation for the development of the\r\nLicklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) designed to provide\r\nretransmission-based reliability over links characterized by\r\nextremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and\/or frequent\r\ninterruptions in connectivity.  Since communication across\r\ninterplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of\r\nenvironment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting \"long-haul\"\r\nreliable transmission in interplanetary space, but it has\r\napplications in other environments as well.\r\n\r\nIn an Interplanetary Internet setting deploying the Bundle protocol,\r\nLTP is intended to serve as a reliable convergence layer over\r\nsingle-hop deep-space radio frequency (RF) links.  LTP does Automatic\r\nRepeat reQuest (ARQ) of data transmissions by soliciting\r\nselective-acknowledgment reception reports.  It is stateful and has no\r\nnegotiation or handshakes.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research\r\nGroup and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its\r\npublication as an RFC were raised.  This memo defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","ltp","round-trip times","long-haul"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5325","errata_url":null}
