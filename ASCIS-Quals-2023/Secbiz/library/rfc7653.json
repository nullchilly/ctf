That mechanism is limited\r\nto queries for DHCPv6 binding data updates prior to the time the\r\nDHCPv6 server receives the Leasequery request.  Continuous update of\r\nan external requestor with Leasequery data is sometimes desired.\r\nThis document expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery protocol and allows\r\nfor active transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding information data via\r\nTCP.  This document also updates DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery (RFC 5460) by\r\nadding new options.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":["DHCP","IPv6","ACTIVELEASEQUERY","DHCPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5460"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7653","errata_url":null}
