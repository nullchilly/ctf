When the data flow\r\npath contains IP tunnel segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect\r\nwithin those tunnel segments.  Therefore, the resulting tunnel\r\nsegments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate the QoS\r\nefforts in the rest of the end-to-end path.  The problem with NSIS\r\nsignaling within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation\r\nthat masks packets' original IP header fields.  Those original IP\r\nheader fields are needed to intercept NSIS signaling messages and\r\nclassify QoS data packets.  This document defines a solution to this\r\nproblem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding\r\nQoS sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS\r\nsignaling into the IP tunnel segments.  This document defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["nsis qos","next steps in signaling"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5979","errata_url":null}
