{"draft":"draft-lepinski-dh-groups-03","doc_id":"RFC5114","title":"Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards","authors":["M. Lepinski","S. Kent"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"23","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"This document describes eight Diffie-Hellman groups that can be used\r\nin conjunction with IETF protocols to provide security for Internet\r\ncommunications.  The groups allow implementers to use the same groups\r\nwith a variety of security protocols, e.g., SMIME, Secure SHell (SSH),\r\nTransport Layer Security (TLS), and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).\r\n\r\nAll of these groups comply in form and structure with relevant\r\nstandards from ISO, ANSI, NIST, and the IEEE.  These groups are\r\ncompatible with all IETF standards that make use of Diffie-Hellman or\r\nElliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography.\r\n\r\nThese groups and the associated test data are defined by NIST on\r\ntheir web site [EX80056A], but have not yet (as of this writing) been\r\npublished in a formal NIST document.  Publication of these groups and\r\nassociated test data, as well as describing how to use Diffie-Hellman\r\nand Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement in all of the\r\nprotocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate development of\r\ninteroperable implementations and support the Federal Information\r\nProcessing Standard (FIPS) validation of\r\nimplementations that make use of these groups.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"January 2008","keywords":["elliptic curve","ike","tls","ssh","smime","x.509"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5114","errata_url":null}
