One MIB module\r\ndefines objects for managing the 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced\r\nMulticast Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D-1998 and P802.1t-2001 (TM).\r\nThe other MIB module defines objects for managing VLANs, as specified\r\nin IEEE 802.1Q-2003, P802.1u (TM), and P802.1v (TM).\r\n\r\nProvisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions\r\nare also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by\r\nsubnetworks other than LAN segments.\r\n\r\nThis memo supplements RFC 4188 and obsoletes RFC 2674.
