Experience\r\nhas shown that extension of protocols without early IETF review can\r\ncarry risk.  The document also recommends that major extensions to or\r\nvariations of IETF protocols only take place through normal IETF\r\nprocesses or in coordination with the IETF.\r\n\r\nThis document is directed principally at other Standards Development\r\nOrganizations (SDOs) and vendors considering requirements for\r\nextensions to IETF protocols.  It does not modify formal IETF\r\nprocesses.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"December 2006","keywords":["[--------|b]","sdo","standards development organization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0125"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4775","errata_url":null}
