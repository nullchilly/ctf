A UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee\r\nuniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs were originally\r\nused in the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open\r\nSoftware Foundation\\'s (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE),\r\nand then in Microsoft Windows platforms.\r\n\r\nThis specification is derived from the DCE specification with the\r\nkind permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group).
