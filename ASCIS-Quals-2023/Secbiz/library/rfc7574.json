PPSPP supports streaming of both prerecorded (on-\r\ndemand) and live audio\/video content.  It is based on the peer-to-\r\npeer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are put on equal\r\nfooting with the servers initially providing the content, to create a\r\nsystem where everyone can potentially provide upload bandwidth.  It\r\nhas been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end\r\nuser and to prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers.\r\nPPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and extensible.  It can\r\nuse different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent\r\nfreeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes\r\n(centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).  It supports\r\nmultiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk\r\naddressing.  Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of\r\nvarious transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using\r\nLow Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT) for congestion control.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["video on demand","live streaming","content integrity protection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7574","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7574"}
