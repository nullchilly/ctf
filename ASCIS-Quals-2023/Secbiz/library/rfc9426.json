BATched Sparse (BATS) code is a class of efficient\r\nlinear network coding scheme with a matrix generalization of fountain\r\ncodes as the outer code and batch-based linear network coding as the\r\ninner code. This document describes a baseline BATS coding scheme for\r\ncommunication through multi-hop networks and discusses the related\r\nresearch issues towards a more sophisticated BATS coding scheme.
