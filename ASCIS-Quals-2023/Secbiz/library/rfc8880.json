However, in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations\r\nsection (Section 8.1), that specification (RFC 7050) indicates that\r\nthe name actually has no particularly special properties that would\r\nrequire special handling.\r\n\r\nConsequently, despite the well-articulated special purpose of the\r\nname, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain\r\nNames registry as a name with special properties.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 7050. It describes the special treatment\r\nrequired and formally declares the special properties of the name. It\r\nalso adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping\r\nnames.","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["IPv6","NAT64","DNS64"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7050"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8880","errata_url":null}
