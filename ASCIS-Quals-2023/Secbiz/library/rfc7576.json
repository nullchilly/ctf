Finally, the document outlines the general features\r\nthat are missing from current network abilities and are needed in the\r\nideal Autonomic Network concept.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the IRTF's Network Management Research\r\nGroup.\r\n","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7576","errata_url":null}
