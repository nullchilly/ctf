IS-IS is specified in International\r\nStandards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support\r\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base\r\nspecification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for\r\nmultiple authentication algorithms.  The base specification only\r\nspecifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords.  This document\r\nreplaces RFC 3567.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an extension to that specification that allows\r\nthe use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in\r\nconjunction with the existing authentication mechanisms.
