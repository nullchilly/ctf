These policies, known as \"Label                   \r\nGeneration Rulesets\" (LGRs), are used for the implementation of\r\nInternationalized Domain Names (IDNs), for example.  The rulesets are\r\nused to implement and share that aspect of policy defining which\r\nlabels and Unicode code points are permitted for registrations, which\r\nalternative code points are considered variants, and what actions may\r\nbe performed on labels containing those variants.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["IDN","LGR","IDN table","variant table"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7940","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7940"}
