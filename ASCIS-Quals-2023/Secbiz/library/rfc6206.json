Dynamically\r\nadjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new\r\ninformation on the scale of link-layer transmission times while\r\nsending only a few messages per hour when information does not\r\nchange.  A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point\r\nselection allow Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically\r\nwith density.  This document describes the Trickle algorithm and\r\nconsiderations in its use.
