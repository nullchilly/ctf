Sparks"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"26","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"Session Initiation Proposal Investigation","abstract":"Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can create\r\nan association between endpoints known as a dialog.  Some of these\r\nmethods can also create a different, but related, association within\r\nan existing dialog.  These multiple associations, or dialog usages,\r\nrequire carefully coordinated processing as they have independent\r\nlife-cycles, but share common dialog state.  Processing multiple\r\ndialog usages correctly is not completely understood.  What is\r\nunderstood is difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nThis memo argues that multiple dialog usages should be avoided.  It\r\ndiscusses alternatives to their use and clarifies essential behavior\r\nfor elements that cannot currently avoid them.\r\n\r\nThis is an informative document and makes no normative statements of\r\nany kind.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2007","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5057","errata_url":null}
