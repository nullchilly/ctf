      <xref target="RFC9300" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9300"/> <xref target="RFC9301" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9301"/>, its
      main operational mechanisms, and its design rationale. Fundamentally, LISP is
      built following a well-known architectural idea: decoupling the overloaded semantics of IP addresses. As pointed out by <contact fullname="Noel Chiappa"/>
        <xref target="RFC4984" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4984"/>, currently, IP addresses identify
      both the topological location of a network attachment point as well
      as the node's identity.  However, nodes and
 routing have fundamentally different requirements.  On one hand,
 routing systems require that addresses be aggregatable and have
 topological meaning; on the other hand, nodes must be identified
 independently of their current location <xref target="RFC4984" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4984"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">LISP creates two separate namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
	Routing Locators (RLOCs). Both are 
	syntactically identical to the current IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  However, EIDs
	are used to uniquely identify nodes irrespective of their topological
	location and are typically routed intra-domain. RLOCs are assigned
	topologically to network attachment points and are typically routed
	inter-domain.  With LISP, the edge of the Internet (where the nodes
	are connected) and the core (where inter-domain routing occurs) can be
	logically separated. LISP-capable routers interconnect the two logical spaces.
	LISP also introduces a database, called the
	Mapping System, to store and retrieve mappings between identity and
	location.  LISP-capable routers exchange packets over the Internet
	core by encapsulating them to the appropriate location.</t>

   Traffic Engineering (TE) mechanisms are pushed to the Mapping System.   
In such a scenario, RLOCs are quasi-static (i.e., low
      churn), hence making the routing system scalable <xref target="Quoitin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Quoitin"/>, while EIDs can roam anywhere with no churn to the

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-1">LISP architecturally splits the core from the edge of the
        Internet by creating two separate namespaces: Endpoint
        Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs). The edge
        consists of LISP sites (e.g., an Autonomous System) that use
        EID addresses. EIDs are IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that uniquely
        identify communication end hosts and are assigned and
        configured by the same mechanisms that exist at the time of
        this writing. EIDs do not contain inter-domain topological
        information, and because of this, EIDs are usually routable at
        the edge (within LISP sites) but not in the core; see
         <xref target="sect-3.5" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.5"/> for discussion of LISP site
        internetworking with non-LISP sites and domains in the
        Internet.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-2">LISP sites (at the edge) are connected to the interconnecting core
	of the Internet by means of LISP-capable routers (e.g., border
	routers).  LISP sites are connected across the interconnecting core of the Internet
	using tunnels between the LISP-capable routers. When packets
	originated from a LISP site are flowing towards the core network, they
	ingress into an encapsulated tunnel via an Ingress Tunnel Router
	(ITR). When packets flow from the core network to a LISP site, they
	egress from an encapsulated tunnel to an Egress Tunnel Router
	(ETR). An xTR is a router that can perform both ITR and ETR
	operations. In this context, ITRs encapsulate packets, while ETRs
	decapsulate them; hence, LISP operates as an overlay on top of the
	current Internet core.</t>

   system becomes reactive, and data plane events (e.g., the arrival of a
   packet with an unknown destination address) may trigger control plane events.
   This on-demand learning of mappings provides many advantages, as
   discussed above, but may also affect the way security is enforced.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">Usually, the data plane is implemented in the fast path of routers to
        provide high-performance forwarding capabilities, while the control plane
        features are implemented in the slow path to offer high flexibility, and a
        performance gap of several orders of magnitude can be observed between the
	slow and fast paths.
	As a consequence, the way to notify the control plane of data plane events must be considered carefully so as not to overload the
	slow path, and rate limiting should be used as specified in <xref target="RFC9300" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9300"/> and <xref target="RFC9301" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9301"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">Care must also be taken not to overload the Mapping System (i.e., the
        control plane infrastructure), as the operations to be performed by the
	Mapping
        System may be more complex than those on the data plane. For that reason,
        <xref target="RFC9300" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9300"/> and <xref target="RFC9301" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9301"/> recommend rate limiting the
	sending of messages to the Mapping System.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-5"> To improve resiliency and reduce the overall number of messages
      exchanged, LISP makes it possible to leak certain information, such

      environments that are not
        fully trusted, like the open Internet, control information gleaned from
	data plane packets must not be used or must be

      (i.e., packets of a flow cross different border routers, depending on
      their direction). This means that intermediate boxes may have an
      incomplete view of the traffic they inspect or manipulate. Moreover,
      LISP-encapsulated packets are routed based on the outer IP address
      (i.e., the RLOC) and can be delivered to an ETR that is not responsible
      for the destination EID of the packet or even delivered to a network element that
      is not an ETR. Mitigation consists of applying appropriate filtering
      techniques on the network elements that can potentially receive
      unexpected LISP-encapsulated packets.</t>

Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to interoperate with Internet sites that may be using either IPv4, IPv6, or both but that are not running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP-speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, normally routes to them are not carried in the global routing system, so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non- LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites.  This document introduces three such mechanisms.  The first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ITR), to act as an intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking hosts.  Second, this document adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP ITRs and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) to substitute routable IP addresses for non-routable EIDs.  Finally, this document introduces the Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (Proxy-ETR) to handle cases where a LISP ITR cannot send packets to non-LISP sites without encapsulation.

The performance improvement is obtained by relaxing the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement for tunnel protocols whose header information is protected on the "inner" packet being carried.  Relaxing this requirement removes the overhead associated with the computation of UDP checksums on IPv6 packets that carry the tunnel protocol packets.  This specification describes how the IPv6 UDP checksum requirement can be relaxed when the encapsulated packet itself contains a checksum.  It also describes the limitations and risks of this approach and discusses the restrictions on the use of this method.</t>

              <t indent="0">When multicast sources and receivers are active at Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) sites, the core network is required to use native multicast so packets can be delivered from sources to group members.  When multicast is not available to connect the multicast sites together, a signal-free mechanism can be used to allow traffic to flow between sites.  The mechanism described in this document uses unicast replication and encapsulation over the core network for the data plane and uses the LISP mapping database system so encapsulators at the source LISP multicast site can find decapsulators at the receiver LISP multicast sites.</t>

              <t indent="0">One of the potential problems with the "map-and-encapsulate" approaches to routing architecture is that there is a significant chance of packets being dropped while a mapping is being retrieved. Some approaches pre-load ingress tunnel routers with at least part of the mapping database. Some approaches try to solve this by providing intermediate "default" routers which have a great deal more knowledge than a typical ingress tunnel router. This document proposes a scheme which does not drop packets yet does not require a great deal of knowledge in any router. However, there are still some issues that need to be worked out.</t>
