GMPLS\r\nsignaling already supports the control of alarm reporting, but not the\r\ncommunication of alarm information.  This document presents both a\r\nfunctional description and GMPLS-RSVP specifics of such an extension.\r\nThis document also proposes modification of the RSVP ERROR_SPEC object.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 3473, \"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label\r\nSwitching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic\r\nEngineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions\", through the addition of new,\r\noptional protocol elements.  It does not change, and is fully\r\nbackward compatible with, the procedures specified in RFC 3473.
