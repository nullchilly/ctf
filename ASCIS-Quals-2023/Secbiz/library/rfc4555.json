MOBIKE\r\nallows the IP addresses associated with IKEv2 and tunnel mode IPsec\r\nSecurity Associations to change.  A mobile Virtual Private Network\r\n(VPN) client could use MOBIKE to keep the connection with the VPN\r\ngateway active while moving from one address to another.  Similarly,\r\na multihomed host could use MOBIKE to move the traffic to a different\r\ninterface if, for instance, the one currently being used stops\r\nworking.
