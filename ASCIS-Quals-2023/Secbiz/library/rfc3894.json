By default, an e-mail message that is processed by a Sieve script is saved in the owner's \"inbox\". Actions such as \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\" cancel this default behavior. \r\n\r\n This document defines a new keyword parameter, \":copy\", to be used with the Sieve \"fileinto\" and \"redirect\" actions.  Adding \":copy\" to an action suppresses cancellation of the default \"inbox\" save.  It allows users to add commands to an existing script without changing the meaning of the rest of the script.
