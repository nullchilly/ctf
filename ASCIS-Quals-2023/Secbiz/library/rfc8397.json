Depending on how nicknames are managed,\r\nthere are two primary alternatives to realize TRILL multilevel: the\r\nunique nickname approach and the aggregated nickname approach as\r\ndiscussed in RFC 8243.  This document specifies a unique nickname\r\napproach.  This approach gives unique nicknames to all TRILL switches\r\nacross the multilevel TRILL campus.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["Aggregated","Global Tree","Local Tree"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8397","errata_url":null}
