In some cases, it can be beneficial to\r\nspeed up the delivery of these items.  The main case is when a new\r\nsynchronization source (SSRC) joins an RTP session and the receivers\r\nneed this source's identity, relation to other sources, or its\r\nsynchronization context, all of which may be fully or partially\r\nidentified using SDES items.  To enable this optimization, this\r\ndocument specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry SDES\r\nitems.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8843","RFC9143"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7941","errata_url":null}
