Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is\r\nencapsulated in a separate object, the QSPEC.  This document defines a\r\ntemplate for the QSPEC including a number of QSPEC parameters.  The QSPEC\r\nparameters provide a common language to be reused in several QOSMs\r\nand thereby aim to ensure the extensibility and interoperability of\r\nQoS NSLP.  While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the parameters\r\nthat can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled\r\nto specific models.  The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an\r\nInitiator QSPEC, which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be\r\ninterpreted by the downstream nodes less the reservation fails,\r\nthereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator is preserved\r\nalong the signaling path.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5975","errata_url":null}
