The document covers practical\r\nexperiences as well as roadblocks and opportunities for this type of\r\na network setup.  The document also makes some recommendations about\r\nwhere such networks are applicable and what should be taken into\r\naccount in the network design.  The document also discusses further\r\nwork that is needed to make IPv6-only networking applicable in all\r\nenvironments.
