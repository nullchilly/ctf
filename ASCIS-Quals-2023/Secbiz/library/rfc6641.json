The DNS SRV Resource Record (RR)\r\nallows a simple way for an organization to publish the root of its\r\nfile system namespace, even to clients that might not be intimately\r\nassociated with such an organization.  The DNS SRV RR can be used to\r\njoin these organization-wide file namespaces together to allow\r\nconstruction of a global, uniform NFS file namespace.
