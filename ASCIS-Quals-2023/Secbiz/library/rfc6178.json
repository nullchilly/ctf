Lack of a formal standard has resulted in different\r\nLER forwarding behaviors for IPv4 packets with header options despite\r\nbeing associated with a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence Class\r\n(FEC).  IPv4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet\r\nare forwarded into an IPv4\/MPLS network without being MPLS-\r\nencapsulated, present a security risk against the MPLS\r\ninfrastructure.  Further, LERs that are unable to MPLS encapsulate\r\nIPv4 packets with header options cannot operate in certain MPLS\r\nenvironments.  While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory to\r\nimplement, it is optional to invoke.
