The\r\nbasic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks\r\nacross an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires\r\nsupport by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the\r\ncustomer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The\r\nalternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4\r\ntunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's\r\nIPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is\r\ntermed \"Gateway-initiated 6rd\" (GI 6rd).  The advantages of this\r\napproach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment\r\nand avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  The\r\nlatter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth\r\nenvironment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":["IPv6 transition"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6654","errata_url":null}
