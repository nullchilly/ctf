The approach described in \r\nthis document allows the VPN service provider to reduce the number \r\nof PE routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring \r\nonly a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when PE routers use ingress replication to\r\ncarry the multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach \r\ndescribed in this document may, under certain circumstances, \r\nreduce bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication \r\nand redistribute the replication load among PE routers.","pub_date":"October 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7024","errata_url":null}
