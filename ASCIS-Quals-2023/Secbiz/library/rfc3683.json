The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications standards in an open fashion.  An important part of this consensus-driven process is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion.  Notably, in a small number of cases, a participant has engaged in a \"denial-of-service\" attack to disrupt the consensus-driven process.  Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks become more common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or eliminates these attacks.  This memo recommends such a practice for use by the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
