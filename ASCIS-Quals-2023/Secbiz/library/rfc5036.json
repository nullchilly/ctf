A fundamental concept in MPLS is\r\nthat two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of\r\nthe labels used to forward traffic between and through them.  This\r\ncommon understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called\r\na label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of\r\nlabel bindings it has made.  This document defines a set of such\r\nprocedures called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs\r\ndistribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed\r\npaths.
