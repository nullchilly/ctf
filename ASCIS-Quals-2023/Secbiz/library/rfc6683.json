The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers\r\nfor FEC protection.  The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D\r\ninterleaved parity code.  The second (enhancement) layer is based on\r\nthe Raptor code.  By offering a layered approach, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC\r\nprotocol offers good protection against both bursty and random packet\r\nlosses at a cost of decent complexity.  This document describes how\r\none can implement the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using the 1-D\r\ninterleaved parity code and Raptor code that have already been\r\nspecified in separate documents.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["DVB","FEC","AL-FEC","IPTV","parity codes","Raptor codes"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6683","errata_url":null}
