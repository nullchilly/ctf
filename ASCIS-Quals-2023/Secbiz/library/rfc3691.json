Certain types of IMAP clients need to release resources associated with the selected mailbox without selecting a different mailbox.  While IMAP4 provides this functionality (via a SELECT command with a nonexistent mailbox name or reselecting the same mailbox with EXAMINE command), a more clean solution is desirable.
