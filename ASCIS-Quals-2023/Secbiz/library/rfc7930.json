This specification extends the\r\nRADIUS-over-TCP experiment (RFC 6613) to permit larger RADIUS\r\npackets.  This specification compliments other ongoing work to permit\r\nfragmentation of RADIUS authorization information.  This document\r\nregisters a new RADIUS code, an action that required IESG approval.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["ABFAB"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6613"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7930","errata_url":null}
