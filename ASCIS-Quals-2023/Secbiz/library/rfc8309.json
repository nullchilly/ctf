Note that service models do not make any\r\nassumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered for\r\na customer; details of how network protocols and devices are\r\nengineered to deliver a service are captured in other modules that\r\nare not exposed through the interface between the customer and the\r\nprovider.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["YANG","NETCONF","RESTCONF","Data Model","SDN","Software Defined Network","Service Orchestrator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8309","errata_url":null}
