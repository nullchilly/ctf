This\r\ndocument adds a new chunk to SCTP for carrying payload data.  This\r\nallows a sender to interleave different user messages that would\r\notherwise result in head-of-line blocking at the sender.  The\r\ninterleaving of user messages is required for WebRTC data channels.\r\n\r\nWhenever an SCTP sender is allowed to send user data, it may choose\r\nfrom multiple outgoing SCTP streams.  Multiple ways for performing\r\nthis selection, called stream schedulers, are defined in this\r\ndocument.  A stream scheduler can choose to either implement, or not\r\nimplement, user message interleaving.","pub_date":"November 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8260","errata_url":null}
