This Feature is a replacement of the ARPANET non-blocking    host interface, which was never implemented, and will be available to    hosts using either the 1822 or 1822L Host Access Protocol.  This RFC    is also being presented as a solicitation of comments on the Short    Blocking Feature, especially from host network software implementers    and maintainers.
