This\r\nwill lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some\r\nInternet paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not\r\nincluded as a possibility in many protocol specifications.  Worse\r\nthan the millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause\r\nserious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed in\r\ntime.","pub_date":"1 April 2020","keywords":["Teleportation","Entanglement","0-RTT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8774","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8774"}
