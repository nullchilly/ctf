The proposed approach is based on\r\nassociating a version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and the\r\ntransport of such a version number in the LISP-specific header of\r\nLISP-encapsulated packets.  LISP Map-Versioning is particularly\r\nuseful to inform communicating Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and\r\nEgress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) about modifications of the mappings used\r\nto encapsulate packets.  The mechanism is transparent to\r\nimplementations not supporting this feature, since in the LISP-\r\nspecific header and in the Map Records, bits used for Map-Versioning\r\ncan be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs that do not support the\r\nmechanism.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9302"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6834","errata_url":null}
