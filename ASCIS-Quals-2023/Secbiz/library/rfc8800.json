The proposed extension\r\nallows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to advertise to a Path\r\nComputation Element (PCE) that a particular LSP belongs to a\r\nparticular Disjoint Association Group; thus, the PCE knows that the\r\nLSPs in the same group need to be disjoint from each other.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["Disjoint","disjointness","association"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8800","errata_url":null}
