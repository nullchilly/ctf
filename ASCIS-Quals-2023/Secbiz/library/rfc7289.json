The CGN\r\ninfrastructure will often form a NAT444 environment as the subscriber\r\nhome network will likely also maintain a subscriber-side NAT\r\nfunction.  Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major driver\r\ncompelling some operators to implement CGN.  Although operators may\r\nwish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near-\r\nterm needs may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone.  This\r\ndocument provides a practical integration model that allows the CGN\r\nplatform to be integrated into the network, meeting the connectivity\r\nneeds of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting\r\nexisting services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN\r\nbrings.  The model included in this document utilizes BGP\/MPLS IP\r\nVPNs, which allow for virtual routing separation, helping ease the\r\nCGN's impact on the network.  This document does not intend to defend\r\nthe merits of CGN.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["NAT444","LSN","Large-Scale NAT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7289","errata_url":null}
