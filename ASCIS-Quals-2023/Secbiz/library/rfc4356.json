This service uses formats and\r\nprotocols that are similar to, but differ in key ways from, those\r\nused in Internet mail.\r\n\r\nOne important difference between MMS and Internet Mail is that MMS\r\nuses headers that start with \"X-Mms-\" to carry a variety of user\r\nagent- and server-related information elements.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies how to exchange messages between these two\r\nservices, including mapping information elements as used in MMS\r\nX-Mms-* headers as well as delivery and disposition reports, to and\r\nfrom that used in SMTP and Internet message headers.
