As most\r\nof the traffic in future networks is expected to be video, we\r\nconsider how to modify the existing video streaming mechanisms.\r\nSeveral important topics related to video distribution over ICN are\r\npresented.  The wide range of scenarios covered includes the\r\nfollowing: evolving Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) to\r\nwork over ICN and leverage the recent ISO\/IEC Moving Picture Experts\r\nGroup (MPEG) standard, layering encoding over ICN, introducing\r\ndistinct requirements for video using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms,\r\nadapting the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) for ICN, creating\r\nmore stringent requirements over ICN because of delay constraints\r\nadded by Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and managing digital\r\nrights in ICN.  Finally, in addition to considering how existing\r\nmechanisms would be impacted by ICN, this document lists some\r\nresearch issues to design ICN-specific video streaming mechanisms.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["ICN","CCN","NDN","DASH","adaptive video streaming","scalable video streaming","IPTV","P2P","DRM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7933","errata_url":null}
