According to the algorithm as originally described, when a\r\nhost's default router list is empty, the host assumes that all\r\ndestinations are on-link.  This is particularly problematic with\r\nIPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link IPv6 connectivity (e.g.,\r\nno default router).  This document describes how making this\r\nassumption causes problems and how these problems outweigh the\r\nbenefits of this part of the conceptual sending algorithm.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2007","keywords":["internet protocol version 6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4943","errata_url":null}
