Failing to respond to queries,\r\nor responding incorrectly, causes both immediate operational problems\r\nand long-term problems with protocol development. \r\n\r\nThis document identifies a number of common kinds of queries to which\r\nsome servers either fail to respond or respond incorrectly.  This\r\ndocument also suggests procedures for zone operators to apply to\r\nidentify and remediate the problem. \r\n\r\nThe document does not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure\r\nof the responses.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["conformance","compliance"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0231"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8906","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8906"}
