IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service-specific\r\nConvergence Sublayers for transmitting upper-layer protocols.  The\r\nPacket CS (Packet Convergence Sublayer) is used for the transport of\r\nall packet-based protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP) and\r\nIEEE 802.3 (Ethernet).  The IP-specific part of the Packet CS enables\r\nthe transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16 Media\r\nAccess Control (MAC) layer.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission\r\nUnit (MTU), and the address assignment procedures for transmitting\r\nIPv4 packets over the IP-specific part of the Packet Convergence\r\nSublayer of IEEE 802.16.
