This response code enables calling parties to\r\nlearn that an intermediary rejected their call attempt. No one will\r\ndeliver, and thus answer, the call. As a 6xx code, the caller will be\r\naware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will\r\nlikely fail. The initial use case driving the need for the 608\r\nresponse code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine. In\r\nthis case, the rejection is by a machine or other process. This\r\ncontrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code in which a human\r\nat the target User Agent Server indicates the user did not want the\r\ncall. In some jurisdictions, this distinction is important. This\r\ndocument also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608\r\nresponses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked\r\ntheir calls in error. This provides a remediation mechanism for legal\r\ncallers that find their calls blocked.","pub_date":"December 2019","keywords":["STIR","SIPCORE","IANA"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8688","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8688"}
