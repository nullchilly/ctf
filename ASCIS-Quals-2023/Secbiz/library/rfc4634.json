The purpose of this document is\r\nto make source code performing these hash functions conveniently\r\navailable to the Internet community.  The sample code supports input\r\nstrings of arbitrary bit length.  SHA-1's sample code from RFC 3174\r\nhas also been updated to handle input strings of arbitrary bit\r\nlength.  Most of the text herein was adapted by the authors from FIPS 180-2.\r\n\r\nCode to perform SHA-based HMACs, with arbitrary bit length text, is also included.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2006","keywords":["fips","federal information processing standard","sha-224","sha-256","sha-384","sha-512"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6234"],"updates":["RFC3174"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4634","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4634"}
