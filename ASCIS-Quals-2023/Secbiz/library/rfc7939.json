It defines a portion of the Management\r\nInformation Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in\r\nthe Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for\r\nconfiguring parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)\r\nprocess on a router.  The extensions described in this document add\r\nobjects and values to support the NHDP optimization specified in RFC\r\n7466.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB,\r\nalso reports state, performance information, and notifications about\r\nNHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to\r\ntroubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor\r\ndiscovery.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["Network Management","Management Information Base","MIB","SMIv2","Routing","Neighbor Discovery","MANET","NHDP-MIB"],"obsoletes":["RFC6779"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7939","errata_url":null}
