This opcode was tested in experiments run\r\nduring 1995 and 1996 for the Topology Based Domain Search (TBDS)\r\nproject.  This project is no longer active and there are no current\r\nplans to restart it.  TBDS was the first known use of multicast\r\ntransport for DNS.  A client multicasts a DNS query using the\r\nDISCOVER opcode and processes the multiple responses\r\nthat may result.  This document defines a Historic Document \r\nfor the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6804","errata_url":null}
