      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss
network impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on November 9-13, 2020. The
workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
operators, network management experts, and Internet technologists
to share their experiences. The meeting was held online given the
ongoing travel and contact restrictions at that time.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">COVID-19 has caused changes in user behavior, which in turn drove 
changes in Internet traffic. These changes in user behavior appeared rather abruptly 
and were significant, in particular during the introduction of initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements. This caused changes in Internet traffic in terms of volume and location, as well as shifts in the types of
applications used. This shift in traffic and user behavior also
created a shift in security practices as well as attack patterns 
that made use of the attack surface, resulting from the shift to
working from home in a global crisis.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">An announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020 requesting
that interested parties submit position papers to the workshop program
committee. A total of 15 position papers were received from 33 authors in total. The papers are listed in <xref target="positionpapers" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>.
In addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
existing work were provided. A number of position papers referred to
parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
conferences.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
papers and other expressions of interest. On the workshop conference calls were 46
participants, listed in <xref target="participants" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">The workshop was held over the course of one week and hosted three sessions covering
i) measurements and observations, ii) operational and security issues, and iii) future consideration
and conclusions. As these three sessions were scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
a positive side effect was that the time in between the sessions could be used for mailing
list discussion and compilation of additional workshop material.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-scope">Scope</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people's lives
as well as societies and economies around the globe. But it also had a big
impact on networking. With large numbers of people working from home
or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives, network
traffic volume has surged. Internet service providers and operators have
reported 20% or more traffic growth in a matter of weeks. Traffic at
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise. Most forms
of network traffic have seen an increase, with conversational
multimedia traffic growing, in some cases, by more than 200%. And user time
spent on conferencing services has risen by an order of magnitude on
some conferencing platforms.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
growth. The situation is not perfect: there have also been some outages,
video quality reduction, and other issues. Nevertheless,
it is interesting to see how the technology, operators, and service
providers have been able to respond to large changes in traffic
patterns.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is, of
course, interesting in its own right. How that impacted the user
experience or the intended function of the services is equally
interesting. Measurements of and reports on Internet traffic in 2020
are therefore valuable. But it would also be interesting to understand
what types of network management and capacity expansion actions were
taken in general. Anecdotal evidence points to Internet and service
providers tracking how their services are used and, in many cases,
adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic patterns, from
dynamic allocation of computing resources to more complex changes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally
to prepare for future situations -- crises or otherwise -- that impact
networking, or to allow us to adjust the technology to be even
better suited to respond to changes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">The scope of this workshop, based on the call for contributions, included:</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-1">The workshop started with a focus on measurements. A large portion of the submitted
papers presented and discussed measurement data, and these submissions provided a good
basis for a better understanding of the situation, covering different angles and
aspects of network traffic and different kinds of networks.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-2">Changes in Internet traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected different networks 
in various ways. Yet all networks saw some form of change, be it a reduction 
in traffic, an increase in traffic, a change in workday and weekend diurnal patterns, or a change in traffic classes. Traffic volume, directionality ratios, and traffic origins 
and destinations were radically different than from before COVID-19.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-3">At a high level, while traffic from home networks increased
  significantly, for the traffic in mobile networks different
  trends were observed. Either the traffic increased as well -- 
  for instance, in locations where use 
  of residential ISP services is less common -- traffic decreased as a result
  of reduced population mobility. This observed traffic decrease in mobile
  networks reflected rather the opposite trend than what was observed in
  residential ISPs.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-4">While diurnal congestion at interconnect points as well in certain last-mile networks was reported, mainly in March,
no persistent congestion was observed. Further, a downward trend in download throughput to certain cloud regions
was measured, which can probably be explained by the increased use of cloud services. This gives another 
indication that the scaling of shared resources in the Internet is working reasonably well enough
to handle even larger changes in traffic as experienced during the first nearly global lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-1">The global pandemic has significantly accelerated the growth of data traffic worldwide.
Based on the measurement data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan educational network,
and a mobile operator, it was observed at the beginning of the workshop <xref target="Feldmann2020" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Feldmann2020"/> that, overall, the
network was able to handle the situation well despite a significant and sudden increase in the traffic
growth rate in March and April. That is, after the lockdown was implemented in March, a traffic increase
of 15-20% was observed at the ISP as well as at the three IXPs.  This traffic growth, which would 
typically occur over a year, took place over a few weeks -- a substantial 
increase. At DE-CIX Frankfurt, the world's largest Internet Exchange Point in terms of data throughput,
the year 2020 saw the largest increase in peak traffic within a single year since the IXP was
founded in 1995. Additionally, mobile traffic has slightly receded. In access networks, the growth rate
of upstream traffic also exceeded the growth in downstream traffic, reflecting increased adoption
and use of videoconferencing and other remote work and school applications.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-2">Most traffic increases happened outside of pre-pandemic peak hours. Before the first COVID-19 lockdowns, the main time
of use was in the evening hours during the week, whereas, since March, it has been spread more equally
across the day. That is, the increase in usage has mainly occurred outside the previous peak usage
times (e.g., during the day while working from home). This means that, for the first time, network
utilization on weekdays resembled that on weekends. The effects of the increased traffic volume could
easily be absorbed, either by using existing reserve capacity or by quickly switching additional bandwidth.
This is one reason why the Internet was able to cope well with the pandemic during the first lockdown period.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-3">Some of the lockdowns were lifted or relaxed around May 2020. As people were allowed to resume some
of their daily activities outside of their home again, as expected, there was a decrease in the traffic
observed at the IXPs and the ISP; instead, mobile traffic began to grow again.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-1">The composition of data traffic has changed since the beginning of the pandemic: the use of
videoconferencing services and virtual private networks (VPNs) for access to company resources
from the home environment has risen sharply. In ISP and IXP networks, it was observed <xref target="Feldmann2020" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Feldmann2020"/>
that traffic associated with web conferencing, video, and gaming increased significantly in March 2020
as a result of the increasing user demand for solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
For example, the relative traffic share of many "essential" applications like VPN and conferencing tools
increased by more than 200%.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-2">Also, as people spent more hours at home, they tended to watch videos or play games, thus increasing entertainment traffic demands.
At the same time, the traffic share for other traffic classes decreased
substantially, e.g., traffic related to education, social media, and, for some periods, content delivery networks (CDNs).
In April and June, web conferencing traffic was still high compared to the pre-pandemic scenario,
while a slight decrease in CDN and social media traffic was observed. During these months, many people
were still working from home, but restrictions had been lifted or relaxed, which likely led to an increase
in in-person social activities and a decrease in online social activities.</t>

            <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2.1-1">Changes in traffic have been observed at university campus networks as well, especially
due to the necessary adoption of remote teaching. The Politecnico di Torino (Italy) deployed its in-house solution for remote teaching, which caused the outgoing 
traffic to grow by 2.5 times, driven by more than 600 daily online classes. Incoming 
traffic instead decreased by a factor of 10 due to the cessation of any in-person 
activity. Based on their measurements, this change in traffic and network usage did not, however, lead to noticeable performance impairments, nor has significantly poor 
performance been observed in students in remote regions of Italy. Outgoing traffic
also increased due to other remote working solutions, such as collaboration platforms,
VPNs, and remote desktops.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2.1-2">Similar changes were observed by measuring REDIMadrid <xref target="Feldmann2020" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Feldmann2020"/>, a European 
educational and research network that connects 16 independent universities and research 
centers in the metropolitan region of Madrid. A drop of up to 55% in traffic volume on 
working days during the pandemic was observed. Similar to findings for ISP/IXP networks, 
it was observed that working days and weekend days are becoming more similar in terms of 
total traffic. The hourly traffic patterns reveal a traffic increase between 9 pm and 7 am.
This could be due to users working more frequently at unusual times but could also potentially be 
caused by overseas students (mainly from Latin America and East Asia as suggested by the 
Autonomous System (AS) numbers from which these connections came) who accessed university network resources 
from their home countries.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2.1-3">Given the fact that the users of the academic network (e.g., students and research staff) 
had to leave campus as a response to lockdown measures, the traffic in-and-out 
(i.e., ingress and egress) ratio also changed drastically. Prior to the lockdown, the incoming 
traffic volume was much larger than the outgoing traffic volume. This changed to a more balanced ratio. 
This change of traffic asymmetry can be explained by the nature of remote work. On the one
hand, users connected to the network services mainly to access resources, hence the increase
in outgoing traffic. On the other hand, all external (i.e., Internet-based) resources 
requested during work were no longer accessed from the educational network but from the
users' homes.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.3-1">Mobile network data usage appeared to decline following the imposition of localized 
lockdown measures as these reduced typical levels of mobility and roaming.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.3-2"><xref target="Lutu2020" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Lutu2020"/> measured the cellular network of O2 UK to evaluate how the changes in 
people's mobility impacted traffic patterns. By analyzing cellular network signaling 
information regarding users' device mobility activity, they observed a decrease of 50% in 
mobility (according to different mobility metrics) in the UK during the lockdown period. 
As they found no correlation between this reduction in mobility and the number of 
confirmed COVID-19 cases, only the enforced government order was effective in significantly 
reducing mobility, and this reduction was more significant in densely populated urban areas 
than in rural areas. For London specifically, it could be observed from the mobile network 
data that approximately 10% of residents temporarily relocated during the lockdown.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.3-3">These mobility changes had immediate implications in the traffic patterns of the cellular 
network. The downlink data traffic volume aggregated for all bearers (including 
conversational voice) decreased for the entire UK by up to 25% during the lockdown period. This 
correlates with the reduction in mobility that was observed countrywide, which likely resulted 
in people relying more on residential broadband Internet access to run download-intensive applications such as video streaming. The observed decrease in the radio cell 
load, with a reduction of approximately 15% across the UK after the stay-at-home order was enacted, 
further corroborates the drop in cellular connectivity usage.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.3-4">The total uplink data traffic volume, on the other hand, experienced little change 
(between -7% and +1.5%) during lockdown. This was mainly due to the increase of 4G voice 
traffic (i.e., Voice over LTE (VoLTE)) across the UK that peaked at 150% after the lockdown compared to the 
national median value before the pandemic, thus compensating for the decrease in data traffic 
in the uplink.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.3-5">Finally, it was also observed that mobility changes have a different impact on network usage 
in geodemographic area clusters. In densely populated urban areas, a significantly higher 
decrease of mobile network usage (i.e., downlink and uplink traffic volume, radio load, and 
active users) was observed compared to rural areas. In the case of London, this 
was likely due to the geodemographics of the central districts, which include many seasonal 
residents (e.g., tourists) and business and commercial areas.</t>

generally translates to poor quality of experience. In a recent Internet Measurement Conference (IMC '20) research paper, 
Fontugne et al. investigated last-mile latency using traceroute data from Reseaux IP Europeens (RIPE) Atlas 
probes located in 646 ASes and looked for recurrent performance degradation <xref target="Fontugne2020-1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Fontugne2020-1"/>. 
They found that, in normal times, Atlas probes experience persistent 
last-mile congestion in only 10% of ASes, but they recorded 55% more congested ASes during the COVID-19 
outbreak. This deterioration caused by stay-at-home measures is particularly marked in 
networks with a very large number of users and in certain parts of the world. They found Japan to be the most 
impacted country in their study, looking specifically at the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corporation Open Computer Network (OCN) but noting similar 
observations for several Japanese networks, including Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ) (AS2497).</t>

In Japan, this was partly due to the deployments originally planned for accommodating the

Also, from the numerous research and operational reports recently published, the pandemic

One possible reason for this in the data is decisions by some ISPs, such

certain areas. This suggests that network capacity was available and that
the correlation between income and download rates was not necessarily due

by strong personal contacts and relationships. But it seems clear that the

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.5-1">There is a concern that we're missing observability for the network as a
whole. Each application provider and operator has their own little lens.
No one has the big-picture view of the network.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.5-2">How much of a safety margin do we need? Some of the resiliency comes from
us not running the network too close to its limit. This allows traffic to
shift and gives headroom for the network to cope. The best-effort nature
of the network may help here. Using techniques to run the network closer to its
limits usually improves performance, but highly optimized networks 
may be less robust.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.5-3">Finally, it was observed that we get what we measure. There may be an
argument for operators to perhaps shift their measurement focus away from
pure capacity to instead measure Quality of Experience (QoE) or resilience. The Internet is a
critical infrastructure, and people are realizing that now. We should use
this as a wake-up call to improve resilience, both in protocol design and
operational practice, not necessarily to optimize for absolute performance
or quality of experience.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-conclusions">Conclusions</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-1">There is a wealth of data about the performance of the Internet during
the COVID-19 crisis. The main conclusion from the various measurements is that
fairly large shifts occurred. 
And those shifts were not merely about
exchanging one application for another; they actually impacted traffic
flows and directions and caused, in many cases, a significant traffic
increase. Early reports also seem to indicate that the shifts have
gone relatively smoothly from the point of view of overall consumer
experience.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">An important but not so visible factor that led to running smoothly was that
many people and organizations were highly motivated to ensure good user
experience. A lot of collaboration happened in the background,
problems were corrected, many providers significantly increased their
capacity, and so on.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-3">On the security front, the COVID-19 crisis showcased the agility with 
which malicious actors can move in response to a shift in user 
Internet usage and the vast potential of the disruption and damage 
that they can inflict. Equally, it showed the agility of defenders when they have access to the tools and information they need to protect
users and networks, and it showcased the power of Indicators of Compromise
when defenders around the world are working together against the same 
problem.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-4">In general, the Internet also seems well suited for
adapting to new situations, at least within some bounds.  The
Internet is designed for flexibility and extensibility, rather than
being optimized for today's particular traffic types. This makes it possible to
use it for many applications and in many deployment situations and to make
changes as needed. The generality is present in many parts of the
overall system, from basic Internet technology to browsers and from name
servers to content delivery networks and cloud platforms. When usage
changes, what is needed is often merely different services, perhaps
some reallocation of resources as well as consequent application and
continuation of existing security defenses, but not fundamental technology or
hardware changes.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-5">On the other hand, this is not to say that no improvements are needed:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.3-6">
          <li pn="section-3.3-6.1">We need a better understanding of the health of the Internet. Going forward,
the critical nature that the Internet plays in our lives means that the
health of the Internet needs to receive significant
attention. Understanding how well networks work is not just a
technical matter; it is also of crucial importance to the people and
economies of the societies using it. Projects and research that
monitor Internet and services performance on a broad scale and
across different networks are therefore important.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.3-6.2">We need to maintain defensive mechanisms to be used in times of crisis.
Malicious cyber actors are continually adjusting their tactics to take
advantage of new situations, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception.
Malicious actors used the strong appetite for COVID-19-related information
as an opportunity to deliver malware and ransomware and to steal user 
credentials. Against the landscape of a shift to working from home and 
an increase in users vulnerable to attack, and as IT departments were 
often overwhelmed by rolling out new infrastructure and devices, sharing  Indicators of Compromise (IoC) was a vital part of the response to COVID-19-related scams and 
attacks.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.3-6.3">We need to ensure that broadband is available to all and that Internet
services equally serve different groups. The pandemic has shown how the
effects of the digital divide can be amplified during a crisis and has
further highlighted the importance of equitable Internet access.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.3-6.4">We need to continue to work on all the other improvements that are seen
as necessary anyway, such as further improvements in security, the ability
for networks and applications to collaborate better, etc.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.3-6.5">We need to ensure that informal collaboration between different parties 
involved in the operation of the network continues and is strengthened
to ensure continued operational resilience.</li>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">While there are frequently virtual participants in IAB workshops, the
IAB had no experience running workshops entirely virtually.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">Feedback on this event format was largely positive, however. It was
particularly useful that as the three sessions were scheduled on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, the time in between the sessions could be used for mailing
list discussion and compilation of additional workshop material.
The positive feedback was likely at least partly due to the fact
that many of the workshop participants knew one another from
previous face-to-face events (primarily IETF meetings).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">The process for sending invitations to the workshop should be improved
for next time, however, as a few invitations were initially lost. In a virtual meeting, it may be more reasonable to invite not just one
person but all coauthors of a paper, for instance. At least for this
workshop, we did not appear to suffer from having too many participants, and
in many cases, there may be some days when a particular participant may
not be able to attend a session.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">   During the early weeks and months of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   significant changes to Internet usage occurred as a result of a
   sudden global shift to people working, studying and quarantining at
   home.  One aspect that this affected was interconnection between
   networks, which this paper studies.  This paper explores some of the
   effects of these changes on Internet interconnection points, in terms
   of utilization, traffic ratios, and other performance characteristics
   such as latency.
