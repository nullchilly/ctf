It has been\r\nargued that dynamic assignment of individual ports between\r\nsubscribers requires the generation of an excessive volume of logs.\r\nThis document suggests a way to achieve dynamic port sharing while\r\nkeeping log volumes low.","pub_date":"January 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7768","errata_url":null}
