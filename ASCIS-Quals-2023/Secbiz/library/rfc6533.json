However, the existing Draft Standards\r\n(RFC 3461, RFC 3464, RFC 6522) are presently limited to ASCII text in\r\nthe machine-readable portions of the protocol.  This specification\r\nadds a new address type for international email addresses so an\r\noriginal recipient address with non-ASCII characters can be correctly\r\npreserved even after downgrading.  This also provides updated content\r\nreturn media types for delivery status notifications and message\r\ndisposition notifications to support use of the new address type.\r\n\r\nThis document extends RFC 3461, RFC 3464, RFC 3798, and RFC 6522.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["[--------]","dsn"],"obsoletes":["RFC5337"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3461","RFC3464","RFC3798","RFC6522"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6533","errata_url":null}
