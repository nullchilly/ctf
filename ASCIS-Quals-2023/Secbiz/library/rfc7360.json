The protocol\r\ntransports data in the clear, although some parts of the packets can\r\nhave obfuscated content.  Packets may be replayed verbatim by an\r\nattacker, and client-server authentication is based on fixed shared\r\nsecrets.  This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer\r\nSecurity (DTLS) protocol may be used as a fix for these problems.  It\r\nalso describes how implementations of this proposal can coexist with\r\ncurrent RADIUS systems.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7360","errata_url":null}
