The goal of this technology is to reduce the\r\npacket loss that happens while routers converge after a topology\r\nchange due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through\r\nuse of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to\r\nuse until the distributed network convergence process completes.\r\nThis simple approach does not require any support from other routers.\r\nThe extent to which this goal can be met by this specification is\r\ndependent on the topology of the network.
