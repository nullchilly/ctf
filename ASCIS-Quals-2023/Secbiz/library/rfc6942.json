This document specifies\r\nDiameter support for ERP.  It defines a new Diameter ERP application\r\nto transport ERP messages between an ER authenticator and the ER\r\nserver, and a set of new Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) that can be\r\nused to transport the cryptographic material needed by the\r\nre-authentication server.","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6942","errata_url":null}
