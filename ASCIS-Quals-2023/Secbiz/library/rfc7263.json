RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive routing for\r\nrouting messages.  The new optional extension provides a shorter\r\nroute for responses, thereby reducing overhead on intermediate peers.\r\nThis document also describes potential cases where this extension can\r\nbe used.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["P2P"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7263","errata_url":null}
