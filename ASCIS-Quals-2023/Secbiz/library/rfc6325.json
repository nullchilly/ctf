They achieve\r\nthese goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a\r\nheader that includes a hop count.\r\n\r\nRBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as\r\nwell as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes.  They are as invisible to\r\ncurrent IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate\r\nthe bridge spanning tree protocol.\r\n\r\nThe design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of\r\nmulti-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast\r\ngroups.  It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges\r\nto be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the\r\nnumber of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be\r\nsubstantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["[--------]","TRILL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6327","RFC6439","RFC7172","RFC7177","RFC7357","RFC7179","RFC7180","RFC7455","RFC7780","RFC7783","RFC8139","RFC8249","RFC8361","RFC8377"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6325","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6325"}
