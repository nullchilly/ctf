Further, these\r\nproperties are presented as maps, similar to the network and cost\r\nmaps in the base ALTO Protocol. While supporting the endpoints and\r\nrelated Endpoint Property Service defined in RFC 7285, the ALTO\r\nProtocol is extended in two major directions. First, from endpoints\r\nrestricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and\r\nextensible set of objects; second, from properties for specific\r\nendpoints to entire entity property maps. These extensions introduce\r\nadditional features that allow entities and property values to be\r\nspecific to a given information resource. This is made possible by a\r\ngeneric and flexible design of entity and property types.","pub_date":"July 2022","keywords":["ALTO"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9240","errata_url":null}
