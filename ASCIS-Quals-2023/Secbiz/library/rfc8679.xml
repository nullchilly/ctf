	This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting IP/MPLS services and MPLS transport tunnels against egress node and egress link failures. For each type of egress failure, it defines the roles of Point of Local Repair (PLR), protector, and backup egress router and the procedures of establishing a bypass tunnel from a PLR to a protector. It describes the behaviors of these routers in handling an egress failure, including local repair on the PLR and context-based forwarding on the protector. The framework can be used to develop egress protection mechanisms to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to an egress failure and control-plane protocols converge on the topology changes due to the egress failure.

       In MPLS networks, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) are widely used as transport tunnels to carry IP and MPLS services across MPLS domains. Examples of MPLS services are Layer 2 VPNs, Layer 3 VPNs, hierarchical LSPs, and others. In general, a tunnel may carry multiple services of one or multiple types, if the tunnel satisfies both individual and aggregate requirements (e.g., Class of Service (CoS) and QoS) of these services. The egress router of the tunnel hosts the service instances of the services. An MPLS service instance forwards service packets via an egress link to the service destination, based on a service label. An IP service instance does the same, based on an IP service address. The egress link is often called a Provider Edge - Customer Edge (PE-CE) link or Attachment Circuit (AC).

      <t pn="section-1-2">
       Today, local-repair-based fast reroute mechanisms (see <xref target="RFC4090" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4090"/>, <xref target="RFC5286" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5286"/>, <xref target="RFC7490" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7490"/>, and
<xref target="RFC7812" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7812"/>) have been widely deployed to protect MPLS tunnels against transit link/node failures, with traffic restoration time in the order of tens of milliseconds. Local repair refers to the scenario where the router upstream to an anticipated failure, a.k.a., PLR, pre-establishes a bypass tunnel to the router downstream of the failure, a.k.a., Merge Point (MP), pre-installs the forwarding state of the bypass tunnel in the data plane, and uses a rapid mechanism (e.g., link-layer Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), and others) to locally detect the failure in the data plane. When the failure occurs, the PLR reroutes traffic through the bypass tunnel to the MP, allowing the traffic to continue to flow to the tunnel's egress router.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">
       This document specifies a fast reroute framework for egress node and egress link protection. Similar to transit link/node protection, this framework also relies on a PLR to perform local failure detection and local repair. In egress node protection, the PLR is the penultimate hop router of a tunnel. In egress link protection, the PLR is the egress router of the tunnel. The framework further uses a so-called "protector" to serve as the tail end of a bypass tunnel. The protector is a router that hosts "protection service instances" and has its own connectivity or paths to service destinations. When a PLR does local repair, the protector performs "context label switching" for rerouted MPLS service packets and "context IP forwarding" for rerouted IP service packets, to allow the service packets to continue to reach the service destinations. 
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">
       This framework considers an egress node failure as a failure of a tunnel and a failure of all the services carried by the tunnel as service packets that can no longer reach the service instances on the egress router. Therefore, the framework addresses egress node protection at both the tunnel level and service level, simultaneously. Likewise, the framework considers an egress link failure as a failure of all the services traversing the link and addresses egress link protection at the service level.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">
       This framework requires that the destination (a CE or site) of a service <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be dual-homed or have dual paths to an MPLS network, via two MPLS edge routers. One of the routers is the egress router of the service's transport tunnel, and the other is a backup egress router that hosts a "backup service instance". In the "co-located" protector mode in this document, the backup egress router serves as the protector; hence, the backup service instance acts as the protection service instance. In the "centralized" protector mode (<xref target="centralized" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.12"/>), the protector and the backup egress router are decoupled, and the protection service instance and the backup service instance are hosted separately by the two routers.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">
       The framework is described by mainly referring to point-to-point (P2P) tunnels. However, it is equally applicable to point-to-multipoint (P2MP), multipoint-to-point (MP2P), and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels, as the sub-LSPs of these tunnels can be viewed as P2P tunnels.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">
       The framework is a multi-service and multi-transport framework. It assumes a generic model where each service is comprised of a common set of components, including a service instance, a service label, a service label distribution protocol, and an MPLS transport tunnel. The framework also assumes that the service label is downstream assigned, i.e., assigned by an egress router. Therefore, the framework is generally applicable to most existing and future services. However, there are services with certain modes, where a protector is unable to pre-establish the forwarding state for egress protection, or a PLR is not allowed to reroute traffic to other routers in order to avoid traffic duplication, e.g., the broadcast, multicast, and unknown unicast traffic in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Ethernet VPN (EVPN). These cases are left for future study. Services that use upstream-assigned service labels are also out of scope of this document and left for future study.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-8">
       The framework does not require extensions for the existing signaling and
label distribution protocols (e.g., RSVP, LDP, BGP, etc.) of MPLS tunnels. It
assumes that transport tunnels and bypass tunnels are to be established by using the
generic procedures provided by the protocols. On the other hand, it does not
preclude extensions to the protocols that may facilitate the procedures. One
example of such extension is <xref target="RFC8400" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8400"/>. The framework does see the need for extensions of IGPs and service label distribution protocols in some procedures, particularly for supporting protection establishment and context label switching. This document provides guidelines for these extensions, but it leaves the specific details to separate documents.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-1-9">
       The framework is intended to complement control-plane convergence and
global repair. Control-plane convergence relies on control protocols to react
on the topology changes due to a failure. Global repair relies on an ingress
router to remotely detect a failure and switch traffic to an alternative
path. An example of global repair is the BGP prefix independent convergence
mechanism <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BGP-PIC"/> for BGP-established services. Compared with these mechanisms, this framework is considered faster in traffic restoration, due to the nature of local failure detection and local repair. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that the framework be used in conjunction with control-plane convergence or global repair, in order to take the advantages of both approaches. That is, the framework provides fast and temporary repair, while control-plane convergence or global repair provides ultimate and permanent repair.

It is an IP address that is logically owned by both the egress router and the protector. For the egress router, it indicates the protector. For the protector, it indicates the egress router, particularly the egress router's forwarding context.

If the service is an IP service, P installs an IP route in an IP forwarding table corresponding to E's IP address space.

	     The first approach is called "proxy mode". It requires E and P, but not the PLR, to have the knowledge of the egress protection schema. E and P advertise the context ID as a virtual proxy node (i.e., a logical node) connected to the two routers, with the link between the proxy node and E having more preferable IGP and TE metrics than the link between the proxy node and P. Therefore, all egress-protected tunnels destined for the context ID will automatically follow the IGP or TE paths to E. Each PLR will no longer view itself as a penultimate hop but rather as two hops away from the proxy node, via E. The PLR will be able to find a bypass path via P to the proxy node, while the bypass tunnel is actually terminated by P.

advertises the context ID as an IP address. P advertises the context ID and the
context label by using a "context ID label binding" advertisement. In both
the routing domain and TE domain, the context ID is only reachable via
E. Therefore, all egress-protected tunnels destined for the context ID will
have E as the tail end. Based on the "context ID label binding" advertisement, the
PLR can establish an egress-protection bypass tunnel in several manners (<xref target="bypass-estb" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.9"/>). The "context ID label binding" advertisement is

The correctness of the egress-protected tunnels and the bypass tunnels relies on the path computations for the anycast IP address performed by the ingress routers and PLR. Therefore, care <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be taken for the applicability of this approach to a network.

        There are two approaches for setting up the bypass forwarding state on the egress router, depending on whether the egress router knows the service label allocated by the backup egress router. The difference is that one approach requires the protector to perform context label switching, and the other one does not. Both approaches are equally supported by this framework.

Therefore, the protector <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform context label switching, and the bypass tunnel <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be destined for the context ID of the protected egress {E, P} and established as described in <xref target="bypass-estb" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.9"/>.

In this case, the backup egress router serves as the protector for egress link protection, regardless of the protector of egress node protection, which will be the same router in the co-located protector mode but a different router in the centralized protector mode. The egress router sets up the bypass forwarding state as a label swap from the incoming service label to the service label of the backup egress router (i.e., protector), followed by a push with the outgoing label (or label stack) of the egress link protection bypass tunnel. The bypass tunnel is a regular tunnel destined for an IP address of the protector, instead of the context ID of the protected egress {E, P}. The protector simply forwards rerouted service packets based on its own service label rather than performing context label switching. In this approach, only the co-located protector mode is applicable.

       In this example, the core network is IPv4 and MPLS. Both of the IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs consist of sites 1 and 2. Site 1 is connected to PE1, and site 2 is dual-homed to PE2 and PE3. Site 1 includes an IPv4 subnet 203.0.113.64/26 and an IPv6 subnet 2001:db8:1:1::/64. Site 2 includes an IPv4 subnet 203.0.113.128/26 and an IPv6 subnet 2001:db8:1:2::/64. PE2 is the primary PE for site 2, and PE3 is the backup PE. Each of PE1, PE2, and PE3 hosts an IPv4 VPN instance and an IPv6 VPN instance. The PEs use BGP to exchange VPN prefixes and VPN labels between each other. In the core network, R1 and R2 are transit routers, OSPF is used as the routing protocol, and RSVP-TE is used as the tunnel signaling protocol.

       Using the framework in this document, the network assigns PE3 to be the protector of PE2 to protect the VPN traffic in the direction from site 1 to site 2.

(If the core network is IPv6, the context ID would be an IPv6 address.) The IPv4 and IPv6 VPN instances on PE3 serve as protection instances for the corresponding VPN instances on PE2. On PE3, context label 100 is assigned to the context ID, and a label table pe2.mpls is created to represent PE2's label space. PE3 installs label 100 in its MPLS forwarding table, with the next hop pointing to the label table pe2.mpls. PE2 and PE3 are coordinated to use the proxy mode to advertise the context ID in the routing domain and the TE domain.

       PE2 uses the label allocation mode per Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) for both of its IPv4 and IPv6 VPN instances. It assigns label 9000 to the IPv4 VRF, and label 9001 to the IPv6 VRF. For the IPv4 prefix 203.0.113.128/26 in site 2, PE2 advertises it with label 9000 and NEXT_HOP 198.51.100.1 to PE1 and PE3 via BGP.

PE1 then uses RSVP to signal the tunnel, with the context ID 198.51.100.1 as the destination, with the "node protection desired" flag set in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE of the RSVP Path message. Once the tunnel comes up, PE1 maps the VPN prefixes 203.0.113.128/26 and 2001:db8:1:2::/64 to the tunnel and installs a route for each prefix in the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 VRF. The next hop of route 203.0.113.128/26 is a push of the VPN label 9000, followed by a push of the outgoing label of the egress-protected tunnel.

The next hops must not use any path traversing PE2. Note that the protection VRFs are a logical concept, and they may simply be PE3's own VRFs if they satisfy the requirement.

       The framework in this document involves rerouting traffic around an egress node or link failure, via a bypass path from a PLR to a protector, and ultimately to a backup egress router. The forwarding performed by the routers in the data plane is anticipated, as part of the planning of egress protection.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-12-2">
       Control-plane protocols <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used to facilitate the provisioning of the egress protection on the routers.  In particular, the framework requires a service label distribution protocol between an egress router and a protector over a secure session.  The security properties of this provisioning and label distribution depend entirely on the underlying protocol chosen to implement these activities. Their associated security considerations apply. This framework introduces no new security requirements or guarantees relative to these activities.
      </t>
      <t pn="section-12-3">
       Also, the PLR, protector, and backup egress router are located close to the protected egress router, which is normally in the same administrative domain.  If they are not in the same administrative domain, a certain level of trust <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be established between them in order for the protocols to run securely across the domain boundary.  The basis of this trust is the security model of the protocols (as described above), and further security considerations for inter-domain scenarios should be addressed by the protocols as a common requirement.

      <t pn="section-12-4">
       Security attacks may sometimes come from a customer domain. Such attacks are not introduced by the framework in this document and may occur regardless of the existence of egress protection. In one possible case, the egress link between an egress router and a CE could become a point of attack.  An attacker that gains control of the CE might use it to simulate link failures and trigger constant and cascading activities in the network. If egress link protection is in place, egress link protection activities may also be triggered. As a general solution to defeat the attack, a damping mechanism <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the egress router to promptly
   suppress the services associated with the link or CE.  The egress router would stop advertising the services, essentially detaching them from the network and eliminating the effect of the simulated link failures.

              <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments".  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.  A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain.  SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.</t>
              <t>SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  The segment to process is on the top of the stack.  Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.</t>
              <t>SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.  The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t>

              <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).

            <abstract>
              <t>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop. Given the large scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after failure in a time period that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. In this document we proposed an architecture by which traffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in a timeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The objective is achieved through organizing the forwarding data structures in a hierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum possible number of routes. The proposed technique achieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment, complete automation, and zero management and provisioning effort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP-PIC are hinged on the existence of more than one path whether as ECMP or primary-backup.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to establish backup label-switched path (LSP) tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels.  These mechanisms enable the re-direction of traffic onto backup LSP tunnels in 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a failure.</t>
              <t>Two methods are defined here.  The one-to-one backup method creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point of local repair.  The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a potential failure point; by taking advantage of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel can protect a set of LSPs that have similar backup constraints.  Both methods can be used to protect links and nodes during network failure.  The described behavior and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement either method or both and to interoperate in a mixed network.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes the use of loop-free alternates to provide local protection for unicast traffic in pure IP and MPLS/LDP networks in the event of a single failure, whether link, node, or shared risk link group (SRLG).  The goal of this technology is to reduce the packet loss that happens while routers converge after a topology change due to a failure.  Rapid failure repair is achieved through use of precalculated backup next-hops that are loop-free and safe to use until the distributed network convergence process completes. This simple approach does not require any support from other routers. The extent to which this goal can be met by this specification is dependent on the topology of the network.

            <abstract>
              <t>This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires (PWs) transported by IP/MPLS tunnels against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit (AC) failure, egress provider edge (PE) failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure.  Operating on the basis of multihomed customer edge (CE), redundant PWs, upstream label assignment, and context-specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed by the router upstream adjacent to a failure.  The router can restore a PW in the order of tens of milliseconds, by rerouting traffic around the failure to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.</t>
