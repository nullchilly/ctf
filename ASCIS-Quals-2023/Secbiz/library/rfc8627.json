These FEC\r\nrepair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the\r\nsource RTP stream(s) that carries the source packets.  RTP source\r\npackets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the\r\nsource and repair packets that were received.  The non-interleaved\r\nand interleaved parity codes that are defined in this specification\r\noffer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses,\r\nrespectively, at a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that\r\nare defined in this document address scalability issues experienced\r\nwith the earlier specifications and offer several improvements.  Due\r\nto these changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible\r\nwith earlier specifications; however, endpoints that do not implement\r\nthis specification can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair\r\npackets.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":["FEC","forward error correction"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8627","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8627"}
