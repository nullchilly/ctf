Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment. This document replaces RFC 3010 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.
