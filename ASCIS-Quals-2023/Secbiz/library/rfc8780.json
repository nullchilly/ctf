From a path\r\ncomputation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of\r\ndetermining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and\r\nforms an additional routing constraint to optical path computation.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["Wavelength Allocation","Transparent Optical Networks","Fixed DWDM Grid"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8780","errata_url":null}
