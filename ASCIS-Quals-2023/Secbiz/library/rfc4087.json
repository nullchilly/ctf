Extension MIB modules may be designed for managing protocol-specific objects.\r\nLikewise, extension MIB modules may be designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB module does not support tunnels over non-IP networks.  Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIB modules.  This memo obsoletes RFC 2667.
