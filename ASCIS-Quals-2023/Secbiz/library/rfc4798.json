This\r\napproach relies on IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE), which are Dual\r\nStack in order to connect to IPv6 islands and to the MPLS core, which is only\r\nrequired to run IPv4 MPLS.  The 6PE routers exchange the IPv6\r\nreachability information transparently over the core using the\r\nMultiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4.  In doing\r\nso, the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE\r\nrouter so that dynamically established IPv4-signaled MPLS Label\r\nSwitched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel\r\nconfiguration.
