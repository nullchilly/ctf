It aims to be an alternative\r\nand, over time, successor to the widely deployed iCalendar data\r\nformat. It also aims to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to\r\nprocess. In contrast to the jCal format, which is also based on JSON,\r\nJSCalendar is not a direct mapping from iCalendar but defines the\r\ndata model independently and expands semantics where appropriate.","pub_date":"July 2021","keywords":["JSON","iCalendar","calendar","events","date","time"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8984","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8984"}
