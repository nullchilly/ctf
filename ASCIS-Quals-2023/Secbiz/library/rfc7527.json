That specification mentions a\r\nhardware-assisted mechanism to detect looped back DAD messages.  If\r\nhardware cannot suppress looped back DAD messages, a software\r\nsolution is required.  Several service provider communities have\r\nexpressed a need for automated detection of looped back Neighbor\r\nDiscovery (ND) messages used by DAD.  This document includes\r\nmitigation techniques and outlines the Enhanced DAD algorithm to\r\nautomate the detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages used by DAD.\r\nFor network loopback tests, the Enhanced DAD algorithm allows IPv6 to\r\nself-heal after a loopback is placed and removed.  Further, for\r\ncertain access networks, this document automates resolving a specific\r\nduplicate address conflict.  This document updates RFCs 4429, 4861,\r\nand 4862.","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":["Automated DAD","loopback detection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4429","RFC4861","RFC4862"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7527","errata_url":null}
