The model underlying this structure is one\r\nof well-defined (PRCs) and instances of these\r\nclasses (PRIs) residing in a virtual information store called the\r\nPolicy Information Base (PIB).\r\n\r\nOne way to provision policy is by means of the (COPS) protocol with\r\nthe extensions for provisioning.  This protocol supports multiple\r\nclients, each of which may provision policy for a specific policy\r\ndomain such as QoS, virtual private networks, or security.\r\n\r\nAs described in COPS usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), each\r\nclient supports a non-overlapping and independent set of PIB\r\nmodules.  However, some PRovisioning Classes are common to all\r\nsubject-categories (client-types) and need to be present in\r\neach.","pub_date":"February 2003","keywords":["  "],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC3318","errata_url":null}
