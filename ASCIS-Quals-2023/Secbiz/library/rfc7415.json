A loss-based solution\r\nto remedy known vulnerabilities of the SIP 503 (Service Unavailable)\r\noverload control mechanism has already been proposed.  Using the same\r\nsignaling, this document proposes a rate-based control scheme to\r\ncomplement the loss-based control scheme.","pub_date":"February 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7415","errata_url":null}
