In some\r\ncases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all\r\nthat is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a\r\nsituation referred to as 'non-interactive emergency calls', where,\r\nunlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media\r\nsuch as voice or video or text.  This document describes use of a SIP\r\nMESSAGE transaction that includes a container for the data based on\r\nthe Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  That type of emergency request\r\ndoes not establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE,\r\nwhich does.  Any device that needs to initiate a request for\r\nemergency services without an interactive media channel would use the\r\nmechanisms in this document.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["CAP","Common Alerting Protocol","Non-Interactive Emergency calls"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8876","errata_url":null}
