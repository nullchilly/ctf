The\r\nfeedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion\r\ncontrol algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to\r\nthe sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the\r\nsender needs to perform congestion control.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["Congestion control","feedback message","RTP","RTCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8888","errata_url":null}
