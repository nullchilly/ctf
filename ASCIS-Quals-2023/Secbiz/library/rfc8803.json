A Transport Converter may provide conversion service\r\nfor one or more TCP extensions. The conversion service is provided by\r\nmeans of the 0-RTT TCP Convert Protocol (Convert).\r\n\r\nThis protocol provides 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time) conversion\r\nservice since no extra delay is induced by the protocol compared to\r\nconnections that are not proxied. Also, the Convert Protocol does not\r\nrequire any encapsulation (no tunnels whatsoever).\r\n\r\nThis specification assumes an explicit model, where the Transport\r\nConverter is explicitly configured on hosts. As a sample\r\napplicability use case, this document specifies how the Convert\r\nProtocol applies for Multipath TCP.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":["Hybrid access","aggregation","transport evolution","future internet","extension","Trafic Steering","ATSSS","Multipath TCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8803","errata_url":null}
