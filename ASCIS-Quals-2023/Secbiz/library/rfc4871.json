The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit\r\na signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus\r\nprotecting message signer identity and the integrity of the messages\r\nthey convey while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it\r\nis known today.  Protection of email identity may assist in the\r\nglobal control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".
