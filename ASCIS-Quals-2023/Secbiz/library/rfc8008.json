The document also provides guidelines for the\r\nCDNI FCI protocol.  It further defines a Base Advertisement Object,\r\nthe necessary registries for capabilities and footprints, and\r\nguidelines on how these registries can be extended in the future.","pub_date":"December 2016","keywords":["CDNI","CDN Interconnect","Request Routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9388"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8008","errata_url":null}
