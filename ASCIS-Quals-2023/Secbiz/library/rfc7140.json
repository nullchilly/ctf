That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP from the\r\napplication\/customer at the root node travels downstream to each leaf\r\nnode, exactly as if it were traveling downstream along a P2MP LSP to\r\neach leaf node.  Upstream traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf\r\nnode travels upstream along the tree to the root, as if it were\r\nunicast to the root.  Direct communication among the leaf nodes is\r\nnot allowed.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":["P2MP LSP","MP2MP LSP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7358"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7140","errata_url":null}
