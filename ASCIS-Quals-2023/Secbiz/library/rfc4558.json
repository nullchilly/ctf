Furthermore, when\r\nlink level failure detection is performed by some means other than\r\nexchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of a Node-ID based Hello session is\r\noptimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for Resource\r\nreSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  Nonetheless, this\r\nimplied behavior is unclear, and this document formalizes use of\r\nthe Node-ID based RSVP Hello session in some scenarios.  The procedure\r\ndescribed in this document applies to both Multi-Protocol Label\r\nSwitching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) capable nodes.
