In particular, multihoming with all-active forwarding is not\r\nsupported, and there's no existing solution to leverage\r\nMultipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for\r\noptimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames.  Furthermore, the\r\nprovisioning of VPLS, even in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery,\r\nrequires network operators to specify various network parameters on\r\ntop of the access configuration.  This document specifies the\r\nrequirements for an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution, which addresses the\r\nabove issues.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["ethernet l2vpn"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7209","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7209"}
