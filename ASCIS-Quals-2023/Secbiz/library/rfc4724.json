An End-of-RIB\r\nmarker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence\r\ninformation.  A new BGP capability, termed \"Graceful Restart\r\nCapability\", is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express\r\nits ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.  Finally,\r\nprocedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information\r\nacross a TCP session termination\/re-establishment.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all\r\nrouters, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state\r\nduring BGP restart and those without (although the latter need to\r\nimplement only a subset of the mechanisms described in this\r\ndocument).
