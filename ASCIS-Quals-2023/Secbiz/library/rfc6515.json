{"draft":"draft-ietf-l3vpn-mvpn-infra-addrs-05","doc_id":"RFC6515","title":"IPv4 and IPv6 Infrastructure Addresses in BGP Updates for Multicast VPN","authors":["R. Aggarwal","E. Rosen"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"8","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks","abstract":"To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) service, Provider Edge routers\r\noriginate BGP Update messages that carry Multicast-VPN (\"MCAST-VPN\")\r\nBGP routes; they also originate unicast VPN routes that carry\r\nMVPN-specific attributes.  These routes encode addresses from the\r\ncustomer's address space, as well as addresses from the provider's\r\naddress space.  These two address spaces are independent, and the\r\naddress family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the two spaces may or may not be the\r\nsame.  These routes always contain an \"address family\" field that\r\nspecifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether\r\nthey are IPv6 addresses.  However, there is no field that explicitly\r\nspecifies the address family of the provider addresses.  To ensure\r\ninteroperability, this document specifies that provider IPv4 addresses\r\nare always encoded in these update messages as 4-octet addresses,\r\nand that the distinction between IPv4 and IPv6 is signaled solely by\r\nthe length of the address field.  Specific cases are explained in\r\ndetail.  This document updates RFC 6514.
