Network virtualization is following a similar path\r\nas previously taken by cloud computing.  Specifically, cloud\r\ncomputing popularized migration of computing functions (e.g.,\r\napplications) and storage from local, dedicated, physical resources\r\nto remote virtual functions accessible through the Internet.  In a\r\nsimilar manner, network virtualization is encouraging migration of\r\nnetworking functions from dedicated physical hardware nodes to a\r\nvirtualized pool of resources.  However, network virtualization can\r\nbe considered to be a more complex problem than cloud computing as it\r\nnot only involves virtualization of computing and storage functions\r\nbut also involves abstraction of the network itself.  This document\r\ndescribes current research and engineering challenges in network\r\nvirtualization including the guarantee of quality of service,\r\nperformance improvement, support for multiple domains, network\r\nslicing, service composition, device virtualization, privacy and\r\nsecurity, separation of control concerns, network function placement,\r\nand testing.  In addition, some proposals are made for new activities\r\nin the IETF and IRTF that could address some of these challenges.\r\nThis document is a product of the Network Function Virtualization\r\nResearch Group (NFVRG).","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8568","errata_url":null}
