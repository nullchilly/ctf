As BGP is extended to support new Address Family\r\nIdentifiers (AFIs), Subsequent AFIs (SAFIs), and other features,\r\nthere is a need to extend the maximum message size beyond 4,096\r\noctets.  This document updates the BGP specification by extending the\r\nmaximum message size from 4,096 octets to 65,535 octets for all\r\nmessages except for OPEN and KEEPALIVE messages.","pub_date":"October 2019","keywords":["border gateway protocol","address family identifiers","afi"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4271"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8654","errata_url":null}
