      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">In some application scenarios, it may be desirable to send multiple
      differently encoded versions of the same media source in different RTP
      streams. This is called simulcast. This document describes how to
      accomplish simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in the Session
      Description Protocol (SDP).  The described solution uses an RTP/RTCP
      identification method to identify RTP streams
      belonging to the same media source and makes an extension to SDP to
      indicate that those RTP streams are different simulcast formats of that
      media source. The SDP extension consists of a new media-level SDP
      attribute that expresses capability to send and/or receive simulcast RTP
      streams.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Most of today's multiparty video-conference solutions make use of
      centralized servers to reduce the bandwidth and CPU consumption in the
      endpoints. Those servers receive RTP streams from each participant and
      send some suitable set of possibly modified RTP streams to the rest of
      the participants, which usually have heterogeneous capabilities (screen
      size, CPU, bandwidth, codec, etc.). One of the biggest issues is how to
      perform RTP stream adaptation to different participants' constraints
      with the minimum possible impact on both video quality and server
      performance.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Simulcast is defined in this memo as the act of simultaneously
      sending multiple different encoded streams of the same media source --
      e.g., the same video source encoded with different video-encoder types or
      image resolutions. This can be done in several ways and for different
      purposes. This document focuses on the case where it is desirable to
      provide a media source as multiple encoded streams over <xref target="RFC3550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3550">RTP</xref> towards an intermediary so that the
      intermediary can provide the wanted functionality by selecting which RTP
      stream(s) to forward to other participants in the session, and more
      specifically how the identification and grouping of the involved RTP
      streams are done.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The intended scope of the defined mechanism is to support negotiation
      and usage of simulcast when using SDP offer/answer and media transport
      over RTP. The media transport topologies considered are point-to-point
      RTP sessions, as well as centralized multiparty RTP sessions, where a
      media sender will provide the simulcasted streams to an RTP middlebox or
      endpoint, and middleboxes may further distribute the simulcast streams
      to other middleboxes or endpoints. Simulcast could be used point to point between
      middleboxes as part of a distributed multiparty scenario. Usage of
      multicast or broadcast transport is out of scope
      and left for future extensions.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This document describes a few scenarios that motivate the use of
      simulcast and also defines the needed RTP/RTCP and SDP signaling for
      it.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-use-cases">Use Cases</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">The use cases of simulcast described in this document relate to a
      multiparty communication session where one or more central nodes are
      used to adapt the view of the communication session towards individual
      participants and facilitate the media transport between participants.
      Thus, these cases target the RTP mixer type of topology.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">There are two principal approaches for an RTP mixer to provide this
      adapted view of the communication session to each receiving
      participant:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3-3">
        <li pn="section-3-3.1">Transcoding (decoding and re-encoding) received RTP streams with
          characteristics adapted to each receiving participant. This often
          includes mixing or composition of media sources from multiple
          participants into a mixed media source originated by the RTP mixer.
          The main advantage of this approach is that it achieves
	  close-to-optimal adaptation to individual receiving
	  participants. The main
          disadvantages are that it can be very computationally expensive to
          the RTP mixer, typically degrades media Quality of Experience (QoE)
          such as creating end-to-end delay for the receiving participants, and
          requires the RTP mixer to have access to media content.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-3.2">Switching a subset of all received RTP streams or substreams to
          each receiving participant, where the used subset is typically
          specific to each receiving participant. The main advantages of this
          approach are that it is computationally cheap to the RTP mixer, has
          very limited impact on media QoE, and does not require the RTP mixer
	  to have (full) access to media content. The main disadvantage is
	  that it can be difficult to combine a subset of received RTP streams into a
          perfect fit for the resource situation of a receiving participant. It
          is also a disadvantage that sending multiple RTP streams consumes
          more network resources from the sending participant to the RTP
          mixer.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">The use of simulcast relates to the latter approach, where it is more
      important to reduce the load on the RTP mixer and/or minimize QoE impact
      than to achieve an optimal adaptation of resource usage.</t>

            sampled, in spatial as well as temporal domain. For video
            streams, spatial sampling affects image resolution, and temporal
            sampling affects video frame rate. For audio, spatial sampling
            relates to the number of audio channels, and temporal sampling
            affects audio bandwidth. This may be used to suit different
            rendering capabilities or needs at the receiving endpoints.</dd>

        </dl>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-3">Letting the sending participant create a simulcast of a few
        differently configured RTP streams per media source can be a good
        trade-off when using an RTP switch as middlebox, instead of sending a
        single RTP stream and using an RTP mixer to create individual
        transcodings to each receiving participant.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-4">This requires that the receiving participants can be categorized in
        terms of available resources and that the sending participant can
        choose a matching configuration for a single RTP stream per category
        and media source. For example, a set of receiving participants differ
        only in screen resolution; some are able to display video with at most
        360p resolution, and some support 720p resolution. A sending
        participant can then reach all receivers with best possible resolution
        by creating a simulcast of RTP streams with 360p and 720p resolution
        for each sent video media source.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-5">The maximum number of simulcasted RTP streams that can be sent is

      using the "a=rid" line. Examples of such restrictions are maximum
      bitrate, maximum spatial video resolution (width and height), maximum
      video frame rate, etc. Each rid-id may also be restricted to use only a
      subset of the RTP payload types in the associated SDP media description.
      Those RTP payload types can have their own configurations and parameters

      stream is separated by a semicolon (";"). When a simulcast stream has
      multiple rid-ids that are separated by a comma (","), they describe
      alternative representations for that particular simulcast RTP stream.
      Thus, the "send" part shown above is interpreted as an intention to send two

      sent as two alternatives, identified and restricted according to rid-ids

        However, in centralized conferencing, the RTP sender usually does not

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">This section discusses what the different entities in a simulcast
      media path can expect to happen on the RTP level. This is explored from
      source to sink by starting in an endpoint with a media source that is
      simulcasted to an RTP middlebox. That RTP middlebox sends media sources
      to other RTP middleboxes (cascaded middleboxes), as well as
      selecting some simulcast format of the media source and sending it to
      receiving endpoints. Different types of RTP middleboxes and their usage
      of the different simulcast formats results in several different
      behaviors.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-1">The most straightforward simulcast case is the RTP streams being
        emitted from the endpoint that originates a media source. When
        simulcast has been negotiated in the sending direction, the endpoint
        can transmit up to the number of RTP streams needed for the negotiated
        simulcast streams for that media source. Each RTP stream (SSRC) is
        identified by associating it (<xref target="sec-relating" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.5"/>) with
        an RtpStreamId SDES item, transmitted in RTCP and possibly also as an
        RTP header extension. In cases where multiple media sources have been
        negotiated for the same RTP session and thus <xref target="RFC8843" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8843">BUNDLE</xref> is used, the MID SDES item will also be
	sent, similarly to the RtpStreamId.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.1-2">Each RTP stream might not be continuously transmitted due to any of
        the following reasons: temporarily paused using <xref target="RFC7728" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7728">Pause/Resume</xref>, sender-side application logic
        temporarily pausing it, or lack of network resources to transmit this
        simulcast stream. However, all simulcast streams that have been
        negotiated have active and maintained SSRCs (at least in regular RTCP
        reports), even if no RTP packets are currently transmitted. The
        relation between an RTP stream (SSRC) and a particular simulcast
        stream is not expected to change, except in exceptional situations
        such as SSRC collisions. At SSRC changes, the usage of MID and
        RtpStreamId should enable the receiver to correctly identify the RTP
        streams even after an SSRC change.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-1">RTP streams in a multiparty RTP session can be used in multiple
        different ways when the session utilizes simulcast at least on the
        media-source-to-middlebox legs. This is to a large degree due to the
        different RTP middlebox behaviors, but also the needs of the
        application. This text assumes that the RTP middlebox will select a
        media source and choose which simulcast stream for that media source
        to deliver to a specific receiver. In many cases, at most one
        simulcast stream per media source will be forwarded to a particular
        receiver at any instant in time, even if the selected simulcast stream
        may vary. For cases where this does not hold due to application needs,
        the RTP stream aspects will fall under the middlebox-to-middlebox
        case (<xref target="sec-rtp-box-box" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-2">The selection of which simulcast streams to forward towards the
        receiver is application specific. However, in conferencing
        applications, active speaker selection is common. In case the number
        of media sources possible to forward, N, is less than the total number
        of media sources available in a multimedia session, the current and
        previous speakers (up to N in total) are often the ones forwarded. To
        avoid the need for media-specific processing to determine the current
        speaker(s) in the RTP middlebox, the endpoint providing a media source
        may include metadata, such as the <xref target="RFC6464" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6464">RTP header
        extension for client-to-mixer audio level indication</xref>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-3">The possibilities for stream switching are media type specific, but
        for media types with significant interframe dependencies in the
        encoding, like most video coding, the switching needs to be made at
        suitable switching points in the media stream that breaks or otherwise
        deals with the dependency structure. Even if switching points can be
        included periodically, it is common to use mechanisms like <xref target="RFC5104" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5104">Full Intra Requests</xref> to request switching
        points from the endpoint performing the encoding of the media
        source.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2-4">Inclusion of the RtpStreamId SDES item for an SSRC in the
	middlebox-to-receiver direction should only occur when use of
	RtpStreamId has
        been negotiated in that direction. It is worth noting that one can
        signal multiple RtpStreamIds when simulcast signaling indicates only
        a single simulcast stream, allowing one to use all of the RtpStreamIds
        as alternatives for that simulcast stream. One reason for including
        the RtpStreamId in the middlebox-to-receiver direction for an RTP
        stream is to let the receiver know which restrictions apply to the
        currently delivered RTP stream. In case the RtpStreamId is negotiated
        to be used, it is important to remember that the used identifiers will
        be specific to each signaling session. Even if the central entity can
        attempt to coordinate, it is likely that the RtpStreamIds need to be
        translated to the leg-specific values. The below cases will assume
	that RtpStreamId is not used in the mixer to receiver
        direction.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-1">This section discusses the behavior in cases where the RTP
          middlebox behaves like the media-switching mixer in
          RTP topologies (<xref target="RFC7667" sectionFormat="of" section="3.6.2" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7667#section-3.6.2" derivedContent="RFC7667"/>). The
	  fundamental aspect
          here is that the media sources delivered from the middlebox will be
          the mixer's conceptual or functional ones. For example, one media
          source may be the main speaker in high-resolution video, while a
          number of other media sources are thumbnails of each
          participant.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-2">The above results in the RTP stream produced by the mixer being
          one that switches between a number of received incoming RTP streams
          for different media sources and in different simulcast versions. The
          mixer selects the media source to be sent as one of the RTP streams
          and then selects among the available simulcast streams for the most
          appropriate one. The selection criteria include available bandwidth
          on the mixer-to-receiver path and restrictions based on the
          functional usage of the RTP stream delivered to the receiver. As an
          example of the latter, it is unnecessary to forward a full HD video
          to a receiver if the display area is just a thumbnail. Thus,
          restrictions may exist to not allow some simulcast streams to be
          forwarded for some of the mixer's media sources.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-3">This will result in a single RTP stream being used for each of
          the RTP mixer's media sources. At any point in time, this RTP stream
	  is a selection of one particular RTP stream arriving to the mixer,
          where the RTP header-field values are rewritten to provide a
          consistent, single RTP stream. If the RTP mixer doesn't receive any
          incoming stream matched to this media source, the SSRC will not
          transmit but be kept alive using RTCP. The SSRC and thus RTP stream
          for the mixer's media source is expected to be long-term stable. It
          will only be changed by signaling or other disruptive events. Note
          that although the above talks about a single RTP stream, there can
          in some cases be multiple RTP streams carrying the selected
          simulcast stream for the originating media source, including
          redundancy or other auxiliary RTP streams.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-4">The mixer may communicate the identity of the originating media
          source to the receiver by including the Contributing Source (CSRC) field with the
          originating media source's SSRC value. Note that due to the
          possibility that the RTP mixer switches between simulcast versions
          of the media source, the CSRC value may change, even if the media
          source is kept the same.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-5">It is important to note that any MID SDES item from the
          originating media source needs to be removed and not be associated
          with the RTP stream's SSRC. That is, there is nothing in the
          signaling between the mixer and the receiver that is structured
          around the originating media sources, only the mixer's media
          sources. If they were associated with the SSRC, the receiver
          would likely believe that there has been an SSRC collision and
          the RTP stream is spurious, because it doesn't carry the identifiers used
          to relate it to the correct context. However, this is not true for
          CSRC values, as long as they are never used as an SSRC. In these cases,
          one could provide CNAME and MID as SDES items. A receiver could use
          this to determine which CSRC values that are associated with the
          same originating media source.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.1-6">If RtpStreamIds are used in the scenario described by this
          section, it should be noted that the RtpStreamId on a particular
          SSRC will change based on the actual simulcast stream selected for
          switching. These RtpStreamId identifiers will be local to this leg's
          signaling context. In addition, the defined RtpStreamIds and their
          parameters need to cover all the media sources and simulcast streams
          received by the RTP mixer that can be switched into this media
          source, sent by the RTP mixer.</t>

          for this type of RTP middlebox result in each originating
          media source having a corresponding media source on the leg
          between the middlebox and the receiver. A Selective Forwarding
          Middlebox (SFM) could go as far as exposing all the simulcast
          streams for a media source; however, this section will focus on
          having a single simulcast stream that can contain any of the
          simulcast formats. This section will assume that the SFM projection
          mechanism works on the media-source level and maps one of the media
          source's simulcast streams onto one RTP stream from the SFM to the
          receiver.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.2-2">This usage will result in the individual RTP stream(s) for
          one media source being able to switch between being active and
	  paused, based on
          the subset of media sources the SFM wants to provide the receiver
          for the moment. With SFMs, there exist no reasons to use CSRC to
          indicate the originating stream, as there is a one-to-one
	  media-source mapping. If the application requires knowing the
	  simulcast
          version received to function well, then RtpStreamId should be
          negotiated on the SFM to receiver leg. Which simulcast stream that
          is being forwarded is not made explicit unless RtpStreamId is used
          on the leg.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.2-3">Any MID SDES items being sent by the SFM to the receiver are only
          those agreed between the SFM and the receiver, and no MID values
          from the originating side of the SFM are to be forwarded.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-6.2.2-4">An SFM could expose corresponding RTP streams for all the media
          sources and their simulcast streams and then, for any media source
          that is to be provided, forward one selected simulcast stream.
          However, this is not recommended, as it would unnecessarily increase
          the number of RTP streams and require the receiver to timely detect
          switching between simulcast streams. The above usage requires the
          same SFM functionality for switching, while avoiding the
          uncertainties of timely detecting that an RTP stream ends. The
          benefit would be that the received simulcast stream would be
          implicitly provided by which RTP stream would be active for a media
          source. However, using RtpStreamId to make this explicit also
          exposes which alternative format is used. The conclusion is that
          using one RTP stream per simulcast stream is unnecessary. The issue
          with timely detecting end of streams, independent of whether they are
          stopped temporarily or long term, is that there is no explicit
          indication that the transmission has intentionally been stopped. The
          RTCP-based <xref target="RFC7728" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7728">pause and resume
	  mechanism</xref>
          includes a PAUSED indication that provides the last RTP sequence
          number transmitted prior to the pause. Due to usage, the timeliness
          of this solution depends on when delivery using RTCP can occur in
          relation to the transmission of the last RTP packet. If no explicit
          information is provided at all, then detection based on
	  nonincreasing RTCP SR field values and timers need to be used to
          determine pause in RTP packet delivery. As a result, when the last
	  RTP packet arrives (if it arrives), one usually
	  cannot determine that this will be the last. That it was the last is
          something that one learns later.</t>

This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.  RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.  The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes.  There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.

              <t indent="0">Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF. It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

This document describes how a receiver in a multimedia conversation can pause and resume incoming data from a sender by sending real-time feedback messages when using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for real- time data transport.  This document extends the Codec Control Message (CCM) RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback package by explicitly allowing and describing specific use of existing CCMs and adding a group of new real-time feedback messages used to pause and resume RTP data streams.

              <t indent="0">This memo captures and expands upon the basic framework defined in RFC 2833, but retains only the most basic event codes.  It sets up an IANA registry to which other event code assignments may be added. Companion documents add event codes to this registry relating to modem, fax, text telephony, and channel-associated signalling events. The remainder of the event codes defined in RFC 2833 are conditionally reserved in case other documents revive their use.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document provides a number of clarifications to the original document.  However, it specifically differs from RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all compliant implementations support the DTMF events.  Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support.  This memo adds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework: subdivision of long events into segments, reporting of multiple events in a single packet, and the concept and reporting of state events.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document specifies a payload format for generic Forward Error Correction (FEC) for media data encapsulated in RTP.  It is based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format described in this document allows end systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt to different media and channel characteristics. It enables complete recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical parts of the payload depending on the packet loss situation.  This scheme is completely compatible with non-FEC-capable hosts, so the receivers in a multicast group that do not implement FEC can still work by simply ignoring the protection data.  This specification obsoletes RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  The FEC specified in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 2733 and RFC 3009.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets. Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

This is especially true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns can vary greatly between receivers.

This document defines the semantics for grouping redundant streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework.

              <t indent="0">Source Description (SDES) items are normally transported in the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP).  In some cases, it can be beneficial to speed up the delivery of these items.  The main case is when a new synchronization source (SSRC) joins an RTP session and the receivers need this source's identity, relation to other sources, or its synchronization context, all of which may be fully or partially identified using SDES items.  To enable this optimization, this document specifies a new RTP header extension that can carry SDES items.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes from source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic codes (Flexible FEC, or "FLEX                         FEC"), where a number of FEC repair packets are generated from a set of source packets from one or more source RTP streams.  These FEC repair packets are sent in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source RTP stream(s) that carries the source packets.  RTP source packets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed using the source and repair packets that were received.  The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes that are defined in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of complexity.  The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document address scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications and offer several improvements.  Due to these changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible with earlier specifications; however, endpoints that do not implement this specification can still work by simply ignoring the FEC repair packets.</t>
