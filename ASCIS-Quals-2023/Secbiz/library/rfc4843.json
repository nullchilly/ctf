Dupont"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"14","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash\r\nIdentifiers (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address-\r\nlike identifiers.  These identifiers are intended to be used as\r\nendpoint identifiers at applications and Application Programming\r\nInterfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the\r\nIP layer, i.e., locators.  They are designed to appear as application\r\nlayer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not\r\nappear in actual IPv6 headers.  To make them more like vanilla IPv6\r\naddresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level.\r\nConsequently, while they are considered non-routable addresses from\r\nthe IPv6 layer point-of-view, all existing IPv6 applications are\r\nexpected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current\r\nIPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nThis document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of the\r\nIPv6 addressing space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash\r\nIdentifiers.  By default, the prefix will be returned to IANA in\r\n2014, with continued use requiring IETF consensus.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"April 2007","keywords":["[--------|e]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC7343"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4843","errata_url":null}
