The Ethernet on top\r\nof IEEE 802.16 is realized by bridging connections that IEEE 802.16\r\nprovides between a base station and its associated subscriber\r\nstations.  Due to the resource constraints of radio transmission\r\nsystems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16 Media Access Control\r\n(MAC) functionality for the realization of an Ethernet, the\r\ntransmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 may considerably\r\nbenefit by adding IP-specific support functions in the Ethernet over\r\nIEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with standard IP\r\nover Ethernet behavior.
