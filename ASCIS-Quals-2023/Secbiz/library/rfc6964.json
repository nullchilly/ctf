These sites range in size from small\r\nhome\/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but\r\nshare the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal\r\nrouting and addressing services for most applications.  As more and\r\nmore IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end-user devices\r\nwithin such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6\r\nfunctionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance\r\nfor deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the\r\nIntra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).","pub_date":"May 2013","keywords":["IPv6","IPv4","IPv6\/IPv4","IPv6-in-IPv4","tunnel","automatic","isatap","enterprise","site"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6964","errata_url":null}
