As work\r\nis being done to expand the transports to include secure transports,\r\nsuch as the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol and Transport Layer Security\r\n(TLS), using a subsystem will enable consistent design and modularity\r\nof such Transport Models.  This document identifies and describes\r\nsome key aspects that need to be considered for any Transport Model\r\nfor SNMP.
