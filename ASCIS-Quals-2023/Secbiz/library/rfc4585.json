Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the\r\nReal-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception\r\nstatistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior\r\nin the mid-term.  This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error\r\nrepair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms).  This document\r\ndefines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables\r\nreceivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the\r\nsenders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient\r\nfeedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented.  This early\r\nfeedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for\r\nRTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.
