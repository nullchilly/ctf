This\r\ndocument updates RFC 5444 by providing rules and recommendations for\r\nhow the multiplexer operates and how protocols can use the\r\npacket\/message format.  In particular, the mandatory rules prohibit a\r\nnumber of uses that have been suggested in various proposals and that\r\nwould have led to interoperability problems, to the impediment of\r\nprotocol extension development, and\/or to an inability to use optional\r\ngeneric parsers.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["MANET"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5444"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8245","errata_url":null}
