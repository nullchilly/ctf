The\r\nadditional security mechanisms are provided by the transport protocol\r\nsupporting PCEP; therefore, they do not affect the flexibility and\r\nextensibility of PCEP.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 5440 in regards to the PCEP initialization\r\nphase procedures.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["PCE","PCEP","PCEPS","security","authentication","encryption","TLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5440"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8253","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8253"}
