Using the model, it\r\nprovides a methodology to compute end-to-end latency and backlog\r\nbounds for various queuing methods. The methodology can be used by\r\nthe management and control planes and by resource reservation\r\nalgorithms to provide bounded latency and zero congestion loss for\r\nthe DetNet service.","pub_date":"November 2022","keywords":["DetNet","bounded latency","zero congestion loss"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9320","errata_url":null}
