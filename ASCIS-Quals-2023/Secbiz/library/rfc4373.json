The protocol frames a sequenced\r\nset of update operations within a pair of LDAP extended operations\r\nto notify the server that the update operations in the framed set\r\nare related in such a way that the ordering of all operations can be\r\npreserved during processing even when they are sent asynchronously\r\nby the client.  Update operations can be grouped within a single\r\nprotocol message to maximize the efficiency of client-server\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThe protocol is suitable for efficiently making a substantial set\r\nof updates to the entries in an LDAP server.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2005","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4373","errata_url":null}
