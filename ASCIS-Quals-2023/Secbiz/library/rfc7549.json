Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different\r\noperators and will have its own characteristics that can be different\r\nfrom other traffic legs in the same call.  A traffic leg might be\r\nassociated with multiple SIP dialogs, e.g., in case a Back-to-Back\r\nUser Agent (B2BUA) that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located\r\nwithin the traffic leg.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a new SIP URI parameter, 'iotl' (an\r\nabbreviation for Inter-Operator Traffic Leg).  The parameter can be\r\nused in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with the\r\naddress, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address,\r\nrepresents the end of a specific traffic leg (or multiple traffic\r\nlegs).","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":["3GPP","IMS","NNI","IOTL","CSCF","RAVEL","TRF","operator","transit"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7549","errata_url":null}
