The protocol defined herein allows negotiation of resources between an RSIP host and gateway, so that the host can lease some of the gateway's addressing parameters in order to establish a global network presence.  This protocol is designed to operate on the application layer and to use its own TCP or UDP port.  In particular, the protocol allows a gateway to allocate addressing and control parameters to a host such that a flow policy can be enforced at the gateway.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
