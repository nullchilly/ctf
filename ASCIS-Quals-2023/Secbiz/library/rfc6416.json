This document obsoletes RFC\r\n3016.  It contains a summary of changes from RFC 3016 and discusses\r\nbackward compatibility to RFC 3016.  It is a necessary revision of\r\nRFC 3016 in order to correct misalignments with the 3GPP Packet-\r\nswitched Streaming Service (PSS) specification regarding the RTP\r\npayload format for MPEG-4 Audio.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of directly mapping MPEG-4 Audio\/Visual bitstreams\r\nonto RTP packets, this document provides specifications for the use\r\nof RTP header fields and also specifies fragmentation rules.  It also\r\nprovides specifications for Media Type registration and the use of\r\nthe Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The audio payload format\r\ndescribed in this document has some limitations related to the\r\nsignaling of audio codec parameters for the required multiplexing\r\nformat.  Therefore, new system designs should utilize RFC 3640, which\r\ndoes not have these restrictions.  Nevertheless, this revision of RFC\r\n3016 is provided to update and complete the specification and to\r\nenable interoperable implementations.
