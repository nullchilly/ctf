			the following two attributes are defined for IP service provided to

        <dd pn="section-1-2.2">The ability to maintain an ongoing transport interaction 
			by keeping the same local endpoint IP address throughout the lifetime of the IP 
			socket despite the mobile host changing its point of attachment within the IP 
			network topology. The IP address of the host may change after closing the IP socket 
			and before opening a new one, but that does not jeopardize the ability of applications 
			using these IP sockets to work flawlessly. Session continuity is essential for mobile 
			hosts to maintain ongoing flows without any interruption.</dd>
        <dt pn="section-1-2.3">IP Address Reachability</dt>
        <dd pn="section-1-2.4">The ability to maintain the same IP address 
			for an extended period of time. The IP address stays the same across 
			independent sessions, even in the absence of any session. The 
			IP address may be published in a long-term registry (e.g., DNS) and 
			is made available for serving incoming (e.g., TCP) connections. IP 
			address reachability is essential for mobile hosts to use 
			specific/published IP addresses.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t pn="section-1-3">Mobile IP is designed to provide both session continuity and IP 
			address reachability to mobile hosts. Architectures using these 
			protocols (e.g., 3GPP, 3GPP2, WiMAX) ensure that any mobile host 
			attached to a compliant network can enjoy these benefits. Any 
			application running on these mobile hosts is subjected to the same 
			treatment with respect to session continuity and IP address 
			reachability.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">Achieving session continuity and IP address reachability with 
			Mobile IP incurs some cost. Mobile IP forces the mobile host's 
			IP traffic to traverse a centrally located router (Home Agent,  HA), 
			which incurs additional transmission latency and use of additional 
			network resources, adds to the network's operating and capital expenditures, and decreases the 
			reliability of the network due to the introduction of a single point of 
			failure <xref target="RFC7333" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7333"/>. Therefore, session continuity 
			and IP address reachability <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be provided only when necessary.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">In reality, not every application may need 
			these benefits. IP address reachability is required for applications 
			running as servers (e.g., a web server running on the mobile host), but
			a typical client application (e.g., web browser) does not necessarily 
			require IP address reachability. Similarly, session continuity is not 
			required for all types of applications either. Applications performing 
			brief communication (e.g., text messaging) can survive without having session 
			continuity support.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">Furthermore, when an application needs session continuity, it may be 
			able to satisfy that need by using a solution above the IP layer, such 
			as Multipath TCP <xref target="RFC6824" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6824"/>, SIP mobility <xref target="RFC3261" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3261"/>, or an application-layer mobility solution. These 
			higher-layer solutions are not subject to the same issues that arise 
			with the use of Mobile IP since they can use the most direct data 
			path between the endpoints. But, if Mobile IP is being applied to the 
			mobile host, the higher-layer protocols are rendered useless because 
			their operation is inhibited by Mobile IP. Since Mobile IP ensures 
			that the IP address of the mobile host remains fixed (despite the location 
			and movement of the mobile host), the higher-layer protocols never 
			detect the IP-layer change and never engage in mobility management.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">This document proposes a solution for applications running on 
			mobile hosts to indicate when establishing the network connection ('on 
			demand') whether they need session continuity or IP 
			address reachability. The network protocol stack on the mobile host, in 
			conjunction with the network infrastructure, provides the required 
			type of service. It is for the benefit of both the users and the 
			network operators not to engage an extra level of service unless it is 
			absolutely necessary. It is expected that applications and networks 
			compliant with this specification will utilize this solution to use 
			network resources more efficiently.</t>

	services on the mobile operator. When expensive 
	services are limited, malicious applications may exhaust them, preventing other 
	applications on the same mobile host from being able to use them.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-2"> Mobile hosts that enable such service options should provide capabilities for

	attackers even if the traffic that is used with these addresses is encrypted.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-4">To avoid profiling an application according to the type of IP address,
	it is expected that prefixes provided by the mobile operator are associated with 
	various types of addresses over time. As a result, the type of address
	cannot be associated with the prefix, making application profiling based on the

              <t>The IPv6 default address selection document (RFC 3484) describes the rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API. However, no such socket API exists in the basic (RFC 3493) or advanced (RFC 3542) IPv6 socket API documents.  This document fills that gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source address selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify address selection based on the source address preference in accordance with the socket-level options that modify the default source address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication.  It also specifies socket options and flags for selecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source addresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>Network-based mobility management enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling.  The network is responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.  The mobility entities in the network are responsible for tracking the movements of the host and initiating the required mobility signaling on its behalf.  This specification describes a network-based mobility management protocol and is referred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables an IPv4 device to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device. This document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>

              <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet.  The protocol provides for registering the care-of address with a home agent.  The home agent sends datagrams destined for the mobile node through a tunnel to the care-of address.  After arriving at the end of the tunnel, each datagram is then delivered to the mobile node.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document specifies Mobile IPv6, a protocol that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet.  Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.  This document obsoletes RFC 3775. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.</t>
              <t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.  This  document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) at the network layer.  The hierarchical structure in traditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally deployed mobility anchors.  As some wireless networks are evolving away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not need to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal route.  The motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement are also described.</t>

      <t pn="section-appendix.a-1">The following are some suggestions of possible extensions to the socket API

      <t pn="section-appendix.a-2"><xref target="RFC5014" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5014"/> introduced the ability of applications 
		to influence the source address selection with the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCE 
		option at the IPPROTO_IPV6 level. This option is used with setsockopt() 
		and getsockopt() calls to set/get address selection preferences.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-3">One alternative is to extend the definition of the IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCE 
		option with flags that express the invoker's desire. An "OnDemand" field could 
		contain one of the following values: FIXED_IP_ADDRESS, SESSION_LASTING_IP_ADDRESS,
		NON_PERSISTENT_IP_ADDRESS, or GRACEFUL_REPLACEMENT_IP_ADDRESS.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-4">Another alternative is to define a new socket function used by the invoker
		to convey its desire. This enables the implementation of two behaviors of
		socket functions: the existing setsockopt() is a function that returns after 
		executing, and the new setsc() (Set Service Continuity) is a function that may
		initiate a request for the desired service, and wait until the network responds 
		with the allocated resources, before returning to the invoker.</t>
      <t pn="section-appendix.a-5">After obtaining an IP address with the desired behavior, the application can 
		call the bind() socket function to associate that received IP address with the
