It has primarily been\r\nused to carry voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed\r\nfor data-centric services.\r\n\r\nDECT ULE is a recent addition to the DECT interface primarily\r\nintended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as sensor\r\ndevices, smart meters, home automation, etc.  As the DECT ULE\r\ninterface inherits many of the capabilities from DECT, it benefits\r\nfrom operation that is long-range and interference-free, worldwide-\r\nreserved frequency band, low silicon prices, and maturity.  There is\r\nan added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE,\r\nsuch as for Internet of Things applications.\r\n\r\nThis document describes how IPv6 is transported over DECT ULE using\r\nIPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN)\r\ntechniques.","pub_date":"May 2017","keywords":["6LoWPAN","ETSI","IoT","and Internet of Things"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8105","errata_url":null}
