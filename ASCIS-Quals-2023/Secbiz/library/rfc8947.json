Such\r\ndevices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated\r\nfashion. With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using\r\nrandom assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable.\r\nTherefore, an allocation mechanism is required. This document\r\nproposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to\r\nlink-layer address assignments where preassigned link-layer address\r\nassignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or are\r\nunnecessary.","pub_date":"December 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8947","errata_url":null}
