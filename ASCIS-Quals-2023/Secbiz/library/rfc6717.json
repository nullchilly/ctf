These certificates may be\r\nused for many of the same purposes as X.509 certificates acquired by\r\nother means, but if a Kerberos infrastructure already exists, then\r\nthe overhead of using kx509 may be much less.\r\n\r\nWhile not standardized, this protocol is already in use at several\r\nlarge organizations, and certificates issued with this protocol are\r\nrecognized by the International Grid Trust Federation.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for \r\ninformational purposes.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["Kerberos","X.509","kx509","KCA","kca-service","kca_service"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6717","errata_url":null}
