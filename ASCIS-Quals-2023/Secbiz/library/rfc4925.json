The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable\r\nvendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary,\r\nexisting standard protocols to resolve a selected set of \"IPv4\/IPv6\"\r\nand \"IPv6\/IPv4\" transition problems.  This document describes the\r\nspecific problems (\"Hubs and Spokes\" and \"Mesh\") that will be solved\r\nby the standards developed by the Softwires Working Group.  Some\r\nrequirements (and non-requirements) are also identified to better\r\ndescribe the specific problem scope.
