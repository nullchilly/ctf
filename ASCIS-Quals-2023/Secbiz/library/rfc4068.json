During handover, there is a period during which the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This \"handover latency\" resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration, and Binding\r\nUpdate, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP.  Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non-real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well.  This\r\ndocument specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures.  This document does not address improving the\r\nlink switching latency.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2005","keywords":["internet protocol version 6","access router","mobile node","mn"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5268"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4068","errata_url":null}
