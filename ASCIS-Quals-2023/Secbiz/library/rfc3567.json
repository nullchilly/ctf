IS-IS is specified in International Standards Organization (ISO) 10589, with extensions to support Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) described in RFC 1195.  The base specification includes an authentication mechanism that allows for multiple authentication algorithms.  The base specification only specifies the algorithm for cleartext passwords. This document proposes an extension to that specification that allows the use of the HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm to be used in conjunction with the existing authentication mechanisms.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
