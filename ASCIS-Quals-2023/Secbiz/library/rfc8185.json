A fast protection mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs is\r\nneeded to protect against the failure of an Attachment Circuit (AC),\r\nthe failure of a Provider Edge (PE), or a failure in the Packet\r\nSwitched Network (PSN).  The framework and typical scenarios of dual-\r\nhoming PW local protection are described in RFC 8184.  This document\r\nproposes a dual-homing coordination mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs that is\r\nused for state exchange and switchover coordination between the dual-\r\nhoming PEs for dual-homing PW local protection.","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":["mpls","mpls-tp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8185","errata_url":null}
