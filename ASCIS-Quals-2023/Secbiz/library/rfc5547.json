SDP is\r\nextended to describe the attributes of the files to be transferred.\r\nThe offerer can describe either the files it wants to send or the\r\nfiles it would like to receive.  The answerer can either accept or\r\nreject the offer separately for each individual file.  The transfer\r\nof one or more files is initiated after a successful negotiation.\r\nThe Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is defined as the default\r\nmechanism to actually carry the files between the endpoints.  The\r\nconventions on how to use MSRP for file transfer are also provided in\r\nthis document.
