As networks grow and become interconnected,\r\nincluding connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to\r\npredict the path that SIP signaling will take between clients and,\r\ntherefore, impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the requirements for adding an indicator to\r\nthe SIP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks the PDU\r\nas a candidate for logging.  Such a marking will typically be applied\r\nas part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not\r\nused in regular client signaling.  However, such a marking can be\r\ncarried end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session\r\noriginates and terminates in different networks.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["logme","troubleshooting","debug","logging"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8123","errata_url":null}
