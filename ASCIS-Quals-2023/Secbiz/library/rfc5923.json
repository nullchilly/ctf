Because the\r\nconnection is essentially aliased for requests going in the backwards\r\ndirection, reuse is predicated upon both the communicating endpoints\r\nauthenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through Transport\r\nLayer Security (TLS).  For this reason, we only consider connection\r\nreuse for TLS over TCP and TLS over Stream Control Transmission\r\nProtocol (SCTP).  This document also provides guidelines on\r\nconnection reuse and virtual SIP servers and the interaction of\r\nconnection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP.
