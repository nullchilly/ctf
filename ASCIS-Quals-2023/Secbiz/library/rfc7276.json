Over the years, various OAM tools have been\r\ndefined for various layers in the protocol stack.\r\n\r\nThis document summarizes some of the OAM tools defined in the IETF in\r\nthe context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP),\r\npseudowires, and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL).\r\nThis document focuses on tools for detecting and isolating failures in\r\nnetworks and for performance monitoring.\r\nControl and management aspects of OAM are outside the scope of this\r\ndocument.  Network repair functions such as Fast Reroute (FRR) and\r\nprotection switching, which are often triggered by OAM protocols, are\r\nalso out of the scope of this document.\r\n\r\nThe target audience of this document includes network equipment\r\nvendors, network operators, and standards development organizations.\r\nThis document can be used as an index to some of the main OAM tools \r\ndefined in the IETF.  At the end of the document, a list of the OAM\r\ntoolsets and a list of the OAM functions are presented as a summary.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7276","errata_url":null}
