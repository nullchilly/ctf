It defines a SCHC Compound Acknowledgement (ACK)\r\nmessage format and procedure, which are intended to reduce the number\r\nof response transmissions (i.e., SCHC ACKs) in the ACK-on-Error Mode,\r\nby accumulating bitmaps of several windows in a single SCHC message\r\n(i.e., the SCHC Compound ACK). \r\n\r\nBoth the message format and procedure are generic, so they can be\r\nused, for instance, by any of the four Low-Power Wide Area Network\r\n(LPWAN) technologies defined in RFC 8376, which are Sigfox, Long\r\nRange Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), Narrowband Internet of Things\r\n(NB-IoT), and IEEE 802.15.4w.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":["SCHC","LPWAN","IoT","Fragmentation","Reliable Delivery","Link Layer Protocols","Cross-Layer Protocols","Adaptation Layer","Acknowledgment","Sigfox","LoRaWAN","NB-IoT","Compound ACK"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8724","RFC9363"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9441","errata_url":null}
