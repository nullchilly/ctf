The simplification is\r\nachieved by avoiding the emulation of telephony and its model of\r\nthe intelligent network.  'Simple SIP' relies on powerful\r\ncomputing endpoints.  Simple SIP desktop applications can be combined\r\nwith rich Internet applications (RIAs).  Significant telephony features\r\nmay also be implemented in the endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis approach for SIP reduces the number of SIP standards with which\r\nto comply -- from roughly 100 currently, and still growing, to about 11.\r\n\r\nReferences for NAT traversal and for security are also provided.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2009","keywords":["session initiation protocol","rich internet application","ria"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5638","errata_url":null}
