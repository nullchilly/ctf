When a multicast\r\ndata packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set\r\nof egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent.  The ingress\r\nrouter then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header.  The BIER\r\nheader contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one\r\negress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of\r\negress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in\r\nthe BIER header.  The details of the encapsulation depend on the type\r\nof network used to realize the multicast domain.  This document\r\nspecifies a BIER encapsulation that can be used in an MPLS network\r\nor, with slight differences, in a non-MPLS network.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8296","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8296"}
