RFC 2389 established a\r\nmechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  The number\r\nof extensions, both those supported by the mechanism and some that\r\nare not, continues to increase.  An IANA registry of FTP Command and\r\nFeature names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of\r\nnames and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes\r\nthat registry.
