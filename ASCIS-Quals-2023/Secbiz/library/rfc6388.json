Multipoint\r\nLDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs without\r\ninteracting with or relying upon any other multicast tree\r\nconstruction protocol.  Protocol elements and procedures for this\r\nsolution are described for building such LSPs in a\r\nreceiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for\r\nmultipoint LSPs, for example IP multicast or support\r\nfor multicast in BGP\/MPLS Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).\r\nSpecification of how such applications can use an LDP signaled \r\nmultipoint LSP is outside the scope of this document.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"November 2011","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7358"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6388","errata_url":null}
