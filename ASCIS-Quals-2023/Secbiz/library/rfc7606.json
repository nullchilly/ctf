This document partially revises the\r\nerror handling for UPDATE messages and provides guidelines for the\r\nauthors of documents defining new attributes.  Finally, it revises\r\nthe error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes.\r\n\r\nThis document updates error handling for RFCs 1997, 4271, 4360, 4456,\r\n4760, 5543, 5701, and 6368.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["BGP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1997","RFC4271","RFC4360","RFC4456","RFC4760","RFC5543","RFC5701","RFC6368"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7606","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7606"}
