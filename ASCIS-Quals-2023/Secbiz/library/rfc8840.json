The ICE\r\nextension for Incremental Provisioning of Candidates (Trickle ICE)\r\ndefines a mechanism that allows ICE Agents to shorten session\r\nestablishment delays by making the candidate gathering and\r\nconnectivity checking phases of ICE non-blocking and by executing\r\nthem in parallel. \r\n\r\nThis document defines usage semantics for Trickle ICE with the\r\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The document also defines a new\r\nSIP Info Package to support this usage together with the\r\ncorresponding media type.  Additionally, a new Session Description\r\nProtocol (SDP) \"end-of-candidates\" attribute and a new SIP option tag\r\n\"trickle-ice\" are defined.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["ICE","trickle","SIP","SDP","NAT"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8840","errata_url":null}
