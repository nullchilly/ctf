This requires messages to be\r\ncryptographically protected using a shared secret between\r\nparticipating nodes.  This document compares group keying for RSVP\r\nwith per-neighbor or per-interface keying, and discusses the\r\nassociated key provisioning methods as well as applicability and\r\nlimitations of these approaches.  This document also discusses\r\napplicability of encrypting RSVP messages.
