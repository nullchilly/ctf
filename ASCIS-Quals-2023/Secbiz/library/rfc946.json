{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC0946","title":" Telnet terminal location number option ","authors":["R. Nedved"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"4","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Legacy","abstract":"    Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged    in from usually including information about telephone extension and    office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically    locating people and\/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed    and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing    network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location    Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this    mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is    not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option    (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal    location information between hosts in a localized community.  This RFC    proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
