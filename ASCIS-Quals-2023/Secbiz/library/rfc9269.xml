      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">A 4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane to establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data delivery. In the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for the delivery of multimedia content to a mobile terminal, where each user is receiving a separate stream from the server. From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this approach is inefficient. Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides capabilities for delivering contents to multiple users simultaneously, but its deployment is very limited or at an experimental stage due to numerous challenges. The focus of this document is to list the options for using Information-Centric Networking (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate the experimental setups for its further evaluation. The experimental setups discussed provide guidance for using ICN either natively or with an existing mobility protocol stack. With further investigations based on the listed experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as network-layer multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized data delivery using local caching at the edge may provide a viable alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile networks.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">4G mobile technology is built as an all-IP network using routing protocols (OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, etc.) to establish network routes. The stickiness of an IP address to a device is the key to getting connected to a mobile network. The same IP address is maintained through the session until the device gets detached or moves to another network.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Key protocols used in 4G networks are the General Packet Radio Service Tunneling Protocol (GTP), DIAMETER, and other protocols that are built on top of IP. One of the biggest challenges with IP-based routing in 4G is that it is not optimized for data transport. As an alternative to IP routing, this document presents and lists the possible options for integration of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) in 3GPP 4G mobile networks, offering an opportunity to leverage inherent ICN capabilities such as in-network caching, multicast, anchorless mobility management, and authentication. This document also discusses how those options affect mobile providers and end users.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The goal of the proposed experiments is to present possibilities to create simulated environments for evaluation of the benefits of ICN protocol deployment in a 4G mobile network in different scenarios that have been analyzed in this document.
The consensus of the Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG) is to publish this document in order to facilitate experiments to show deployment options and qualitative and quantitative benefits of ICN protocol deployment in 4G mobile networks.

The mapping of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to CoS takes place at Layer 2/3 switching and routing elements. 3GPP has a specified QoS Class Identifier (QCI), which represents different types of content and equivalent mappings to the DSCP at the transport layer <xref target="TS23.401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS23.401"/>.

While the technology exists to address the issue of possible multicast delivery, there are many difficulties related to multicast protocol implementations on the RAN side of the network. By using eMBMS <xref target="EMBMS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EMBMS"/>, multicast routing can be enabled in mobile backhaul between an eNodeB and Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW); however, for radio interface it requires broadcast, which implies that we need a dedicated radio channel. Implementation of eMBMS in RAN is still lagging behind due to complexities related to client mobility, handovers, and the fact that the potential gain to Service Providers may not justify the investment, which explains the prevalence of unicast delivery in mobile networks. Techniques to handle multicast (such as LTE-B or eMBMS) have been designed to handle pre-planned content delivery, such as live content, which contrasts user behavior today, largely based on a content (or video) on-demand model.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">To ease the burden on the bandwidth of the Service Gateway interface (SGi), caching is introduced in a similar manner as with many enterprises. In mobile networks, whenever possible, cached data is delivered. Caching servers are placed at a centralized location, typically in the Service Provider's Data Center, or in some cases lightly distributed in packet core locations with the PGW nodes close to the Internet and IP services access (SGi). This is a very inefficient concept because traffic must traverse the entire backhaul path for the data to be delivered to the end user. Other issues, such as out-of-order delivery, contribute to this complexity and inefficiency, which needs to be addressed at the application level.

This has been considered by 3GPP <xref target="EPCCUPS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EPCCUPS"/> and is also described in <xref target="SDN5G" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SDN5G"/>.

The TCL helps determine the type of transport (such as ICN or IP) as well as the type of radio interface (LTE, Wi-Fi, or both) used to send and receive traffic based on preference (e.g., content location, content type, content publisher, congestion, cost, or QoS).

(SGW/PGW). The mobile terminal attaches to the Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW) using
an IP address. Also, the data transport between Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW) and

Tunneling Protocol - User Plane (GTP-U) extension header option to encapsulate
ICN payload in a GTP tunnel. However, as this design runs ICN as an IP
overlay, the mobile backhaul can be deployed using native IP. The proposal
describes a mechanism where the GTP-U tunnel can be terminated by hairpinning
the packet before it reaches the SGW if an ICN-enabled node is deployed in the
mobile backhaul (that is, between eNodeB and SGW). This could be useful when
an ICN data packet is stored in the ICN node (such as repositories and caches) in
the tunnel path so that the ICN node can reply without going all the way
through the mobile core. While a GTP-U extension header is used to carry
mobile-terminal-specific ICN payload, they are not visible to the transport,
including the SGW. On the other hand, the PGW can use the mobile terminal-specific
ICN header extension and ICN payload to set up an uplink transport towards a
content provider in the Internet. In addition, the design assumes a proxy
function at the edge to perform ICN data retrieval on behalf of a non-ICN end
device.</t>

(for example, SGW/PGW). The IPv6 backhaul routes the packets within the mobile

	Mobility management at the Layer 3 makes its access agnostic and transparent to the end device or the application. The solution discusses handling mobility without having to depend on core network functions (e.g., MME); however, a location update to the core network may still be required to support legal compliance requirements such as lawful intercept and emergency services. These aspects are open for further study.

Among the features of ICN design, Interest aggregation and content caching are not applicable to control plane signaling messages. Control plane messages are originated and consumed by the applications, and they cannot be shared.

There can be an API to exchange parameters required for transport selection. Southbound interactions of the TCL will be either to IP or to ICN at the network layer.

                            In the HTTP case, the TCL can maintain a pending request mapping table to map, returning responses to the originating HTTP request. The common API will provide a "connection" abstraction for this HTTP mode of operation, returning the response over said connection abstraction (akin to the TCP socket interface) while implementing a reliable transport connection semantic over the ICN from the mobile terminal to the receiving mobile terminal or the PGW. If the HTTP protocol stack remains unchanged, therefore utilizing the TCP protocol for transfer, the TCL operates in local TCP termination mode, retrieving the HTTP packet through said local termination.

When MT is attached to PGW with ICN identity and communicates with an ICN-enabled CDN provider, it will use ICN primitives to fetch the data. On the other hand, for an MT attached with an ICN identity, if PGW must communicate with an IP-enabled CDN provider, it will have to use an ICN-IP interworking gateway to perform conversion between ICN and IP primitives for data retrieval. In the case of CUPS implementation with an offload close to the edge, this interworking gateway can be collocated with the UPF at the offload site to maximize the path optimization. Further study is required to understand how this ICN-to-IP (and vice versa) interworking gateway would function.

Details for secure MT authentication, key exchange, ciphering, and integrity protection messages are given in the 3GPP call flow <xref target="TS23.401" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS23.401"/>.

In case of provider-owned backhaul, the Service Provider may require implementing a security mechanism in the backhaul network.

More details of mobile backhaul security are provided in 3GPP network security specifications <xref target="TS33.310" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS33.310"/> and <xref target="TS33.320" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS33.320"/>.

If we encrypt user-plane payload metadata, then it might be difficult to perform routing based on contents and it may not work because we need decryption keys at every forwarder to route the content. The content itself can be encrypted between publisher and consumer to ensure privacy. Only the user with the right decryption key shall be able to access the content.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-1">In this document, we have discussed 4G networks and the experimental setups to study the advantages of the potential use of ICN for efficient delivery of contents to mobile terminals. We have discussed different options to try and test ICN and dependencies such as ICN functionalities and changes required in different 4G network elements. In order to further explore potential use of ICN, one can devise an experimental setup consisting of 4G network elements and deploy ICN data transport in the user plane. Different options can be overlay, dual transport (IP + ICN), hICN, or natively (by integrating ICN with CDN, eNodeB, SGW, PGW, and a transport network). Note that, for the scenarios discussed above, additional study is required for lawful interception, billing/mediation, network slicing, and provisioning APIs.

The key aspect for ICN is in its seamless integration in 4G and 5G networks with tangible benefits so we can optimize content delivery using a simple and scalable architecture. The authors will continue to explore how ICN forwarding in edge computing could be used for efficient data delivery from the mobile edge.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-3">Based on our study of control plane signaling, it is not beneficial to deploy ICN with existing protocols unless further changes are introduced in the control protocol stack itself.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-4">As a starting step towards use of ICN in the user plane, it is proposed to incorporate protocol changes in MT, an eNodeB, and SGW/PGW for data transport. ICN has inherent capabilities for mobility and content caching, which can improve the efficiency of data transport for unicast and multicast delivery. The authors welcome contributions and suggestions, including those related to further validations of the principles by implementing prototypes and/or proof of concepts in the lab and in the production environment.</t>

Towards this end, we review the ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered in previous performance evaluation studies. We discuss a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address. This includes general aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance, real-time communication efficiency, energy consumption frugality, and disruption and delay tolerance. We detail ICN-specific aspects as well, such as information security and trust, persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in Information-Centric Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data Networking (NDN), which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect of caches in addition to memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should be subject to explicitly unfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed to achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document defines a convergence layer for Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) and Named Data Networking (NDN) over IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs). A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks. In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide states local to the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by short local identifiers.</t>
