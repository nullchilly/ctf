This usage\r\nrequires that IKEv2 be extended with Fibre-Channel-specific\r\nsecurity protocols, transforms, and name types.  This document\r\nspecifies these IKEv2 extensions and allocates identifiers for them.\r\nUsing new IKEv2 identifiers for Fibre Channel security protocols\r\navoids any possible confusion between IKEv2 negotiation for IP\r\nnetworks and IKEv2 negotiation for Fibre Channel.
