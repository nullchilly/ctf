In some cases, the cable modem\r\nconnection is the bottleneck (lowest speed) link between the customer\r\nand the Internet.  As a result, the impact of buffering and\r\nbufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user\r\nexperience.  The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification introduces\r\nrequirements for cable modems to support an Active Queue Management\r\n(AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact that\r\nbuffering has on latency-sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk\r\nthroughput performance.  In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0\r\nspecifications have also been amended to contain similar\r\nrequirements.  This document describes the requirements on AQM that\r\napply to DOCSIS equipment, including a description of the\r\n\"DOCSIS-PIE\" algorithm that is required on DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":["latency","access network","bufferbloat"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8034","errata_url":null}
