        The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the
        responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC
        Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.
        Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series
        Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship
        between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
        and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained
        with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", documented in RFC 5620; and
        obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references to the 
        IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and
        related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.</t>

    Model (Version 1)", documented in <xref target="RFC5620" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5620"/>, and

    the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated,

     The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned
     with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor
     succession, RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is
     also sensitive to the concerns of the IETF LLC about providing the
     necessary services in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

      <t pn="section-1-3">
     The previous RFC Editor model <xref target="RFC5620" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5620"/> was first
     approved by the IAB in October 2008, and our understanding of the model has
     evolved with our experience since. During the implementation of
     version 1 of the model <xref target="RFC5620" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5620"/>, it was quickly
     realized that the role of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) and the
     oversight responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In
     order to gain experience with "running code", a transitional RSE was
     hired who analyzed the managerial environment and provided
     recommendations. This was followed by the appointment of an acting

RFC 8729 does not explore the internal organization of the RFC
Editor. However, RFC 8729 envisions changes in the RFC Editor
organizational structure. There have been several iterations on
efforts to improve and clarify this structure.  These have been
led by the IAB, in consultation with the community and many
leadership bodies within the community.  This first resulted in
the publication of <xref target="RFC5620" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5620"/> and then in further
discussions leading to the publication of <xref target="RFC6635" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6635"/>.  Some of the details on
this evolution can be found below.  In undertaking this
evolution, the IAB considered changes that increase flexibility
and operational support options, provide for the orderly
succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the
RFC Series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely
processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and
increasing cost transparency. The model set forth below describes
the internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining
consistent with RFC 8729.

    diligence in its supervision of the RSOC,  the RSOC should be
    allowed the latitude to do its job without undue interference

          <li pn="section-3.1-5.1">perform annual reviews of the RSE and report the result of

   strategies and options.  During the creation of what became <xref target="RFC6635" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6635"/>, it was
   expected that the RSOC would describe the process it ultimately
   selected to the community.  The RSOC did involve the community in
   interim considerations when that was likely to be of value. Following
   completion of the selection process, the RSOC will determine the best
   way to share information learned and experience gained with the
   community and determine how to best preserve that information for
   future use.

   The RSOC will operate under the authority of the IAB, with the IAB 
   retaining final responsibility.  The IAB will delegate authority and
   responsibility to the RSOC as appropriate and as RSOC and RSE
   relationships evolve.  The RSOC will include people who are not
   current IAB members.  Currently, this is aligned with the IAB
   program structure.   The IAB will designate the
   membership of the RSOC with the following goals: preserving effective
   stability; keeping it small enough to be effective, and keeping it large enough
   to provide general Internet community expertise, specific IETF
   expertise, publication expertise, and stream expertise.  Members
   serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are expected to bring a balance
   between short- and long-term perspectives.  Specific input about, and
   recommendations of, members will be sought from the streams, the
   IETF LLC, and the RSE.</t>
          <t pn="section-3.1.1-2">In addition to the members from outside of the IAB appointed to the
   RSOC, IAB members may participate as full members of the RSOC.  Under
   most circumstances, there will be a specific individual IAB member
   appointed by the IAB as the program lead, who will be a full member of
   the RSOC.  This member's role is distinct from any RSOC-internal
   organizational roles, such as would be created by the RSOC choosing to
   appoint a chair from among its members.  Other IAB members may choose
   to be full members of the RSOC, with the consent of the IAB.  This
   consent is primarily concerned with avoiding overpopulating the RSOC
   and providing it with relatively stable membership, which will work
   best if it is not too large a committee.</t>
          <t pn="section-3.1.1-3">The IETF LLC will appoint an individual to serve as its liaison to
   the RSOC.  The RSE and the IETF LLC Liaison will serve as
   non-voting ex officio members of the RSOC.  Either or both can be
   excluded from its discussions if necessary.</t>

        <t pn="section-4.3-1">The RFC Series Editor and the RFC Production Center and
Publisher facilities work with the various streams to produce
RFCs.  Disagreements may arise between these entities during the
execution of the RFC Editor operations. In particular, different
streams may disagree with each other, or disagree with the RFC
Editor function. Potentially, even the RSOC or the IETF LLC
could find themselves in disagreement with some aspect of the RFC
Editor operations.  Note that disagreements between an author and
the RFC Production Center are not cross-entity issues, and they
are to be resolved by the RSE, in accordance with the rest of
this document.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-2">
        If such cross-entity disagreements arise, the community would
        generally hope that they can be resolved politely and directly.
        However, this is not always possible. At that point, any relevant
        party would first formally request a review and reconsideration
        of the decision. If the party still disagrees after the
        reconsideration, that party may ask the RSE to decide or,
        especially if the RSE is involved, the party may ask the IAB
        Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) to mediate or
        appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although he or she
        not is obligated to do so. All parties should work informally and
        in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.  As noted
        below, any such issues that involve contractual matters must be
        brought to the attention of the IETF LLC.  If the IAB Chair is
        asked to assist in resolving the matter, the Chair may ask for
        advice or seek assistance from anyone the Chair deems helpful.
        The Chair may also alert any appropriate individuals or
        organizations to the existence of the issue.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-3">
  If such a conclusion is not possible through the above less formal
  processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC
  Series Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice
  to the RSE or more general advice to the parties involved
  and may ask the RSE to defer a decision until it formulates
  its advice. However, if a timely decision cannot be reached
  through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement, the
  RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are
  needed to ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Editor
  function; those decisions are final.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-4">
  The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure
  the functioning of the process, and only while there is an
  evaluation of current policies to determine whether they are
  appropriately implemented in the decision or need
  adjustment. In particular, it should be noted that final
  decisions about the technical content of individual documents
  are the exclusive responsibility of the stream approvers from
  which those documents originate, as shown in the illustration
  in <xref target="model-figure" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>.


        </t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-5">
  If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC
  review and decision making may be required.  If so, the
  RSE must present the issues involved to the community
          so that the community is aware of the situation.  The RSE
          will then report the issue to the RSOC for formal resolution

      documents needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any
      associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
