The\r\noverall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo\r\ndescribes the requirements for the signaling applied within the PCN-domain:\r\n(1) PCN-feedback-information is carried from the PCN-egress-node to\r\nthe Decision Point; (2) the Decision Point may ask the PCN-ingress-node to\r\nmeasure, and report back, the rate of sent PCN-traffic between that\r\nPCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node.  The Decision Point may be either\r\ncollocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node (in the first case,\r\n(2) is not required).  The signaling requirements pertain in particular to two\r\nedge behaviors, Controlled Load (CL) and Single Marking (SM).
