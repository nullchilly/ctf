Interested\r\nparties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other\r\ngeolocation data sources and procedures.  This format intentionally\r\nonly allows specifying coarse-level location.\r\n\r\nSome technical organizations operating networks that move from one\r\nconference location to the next have already experimentally published\r\nsmall geolocation feeds.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a currently deployed format. At least one\r\nconsumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation\r\ndata pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to\r\ninform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["geo-location","geolocation","addresses"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8805","errata_url":null}
