For\r\nease of reference, this document collects most of such ABNF changes\r\nin one place.\r\n\r\nThis document also suggests a set of standard patterns for adding\r\noptions and extensions to several existing IMAP commands defined in\r\nRFC 3501.  The patterns provide for compatibility between existing\r\nand future extensions.\r\n\r\nThis document updates ABNF in RFCs 2088, 2342, 3501, 3502, and 3516.  It\r\nalso includes part of the errata to RFC 3501.  This document doesn't\r\nspecify any semantic changes to the listed RFCs.
