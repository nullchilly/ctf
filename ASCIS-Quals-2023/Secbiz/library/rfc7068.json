Otherwise, it must continue\r\nto expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter messages,\r\npossibly resulting in a progressively severe overload condition.  The\r\nexisting Diameter mechanisms are not sufficient for managing overload\r\nconditions.  This document describes the limitations of the existing\r\nmechanisms.  Requirements for new overload management mechanisms are\r\nalso provided.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7068","errata_url":null}
