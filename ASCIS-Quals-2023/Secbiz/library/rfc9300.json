LISP defines two namespaces: Endpoint\r\nIdentifiers (EIDs), which identify end hosts; and Routing Locators\r\n(RLOCs), which identify network attachment points. With this, LISP\r\neffectively separates control from data and allows routers to create\r\noverlay networks. LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets\r\naccording to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.\r\n\r\nLISP requires no change to either host protocol stacks or underlay\r\nrouters and offers Traffic Engineering (TE), multihoming, and\r\nmobility, among other features.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6830.","pub_date":"October 2022","keywords":["LISP data plane"],"obsoletes":["RFC6830"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9300","errata_url":null}
