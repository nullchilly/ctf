Akyol"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"10","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Multiprotocol Label Switching","abstract":" This document describes Time To Live (TTL) processing in hierarchical Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks and is motivated by the need to formalize a TTL-transparent mode of operation for an MPLS label-switched path.  It updates RFC 3032, \"MPLS Label Stack Encoding\". TTL processing in both Pipe and Uniform Model hierarchical tunnels are specified with examples for both \"push\" and \"pop\" cases.  The document also complements RFC 3270, \"MPLS Support of Differentiated Services\" and ties together the terminology introduced in that document with TTL processing in hierarchical MPLS networks.
