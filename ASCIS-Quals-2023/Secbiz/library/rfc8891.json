The algorithm is an\r\nupdated version of an older block cipher with a block length of n=64\r\nbits described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830). This document is intended\r\nto be a source of information about the updated version of the 64-bit\r\ncipher. It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet\r\napplications by providing information for developers and users of the\r\nGOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for\r\nencryption and decryption.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["Magma","Block Cipher"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5830"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8891","errata_url":null}
