As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude is allowed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal nature.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
