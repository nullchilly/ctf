A node commonly\r\nreceives recursive DNS server configuration information from all\r\nconnected networks.  Some of the recursive DNS servers might have\r\ninformation about namespaces other servers do not have.  When a\r\nmulti-interfaced node needs to utilize DNS, the node has to choose\r\nwhich of the recursive DNS servers to use.  This document describes\r\nDHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that can be used to configure nodes with\r\ninformation required to perform informed recursive DNS server\r\nselection decisions.
