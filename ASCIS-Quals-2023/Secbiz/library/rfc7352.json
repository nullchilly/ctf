This test adds the ability to detect\r\nduplications.  The main application for this new test is handling\r\nduplicate deliveries commonly caused by mailing list subscriptions or\r\nredirected mail addresses.  The detection is normally performed by\r\nmatching the message ID to an internal list of message IDs from\r\npreviously delivered messages.  For more complex applications, the\r\n\"duplicate\" test can also use the content of a specific header field\r\nor other parts of the message.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["sieve","duplicate deliveries"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7352","errata_url":null}
