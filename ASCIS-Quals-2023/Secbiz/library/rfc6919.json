Many IETF documents have found that\r\nthese words cannot accurately capture the nuanced requirements of\r\ntheir specification.  This document defines additional key words that\r\ncan be used to address alternative requirements scenarios.  Authors\r\nwho follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase near the\r\nbeginning of their document:\r\n\r\nThe key words \"MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU WON\\'T)\", \"SHOULD CONSIDER\",\r\n\"REALLY SHOULD NOT\", \"OUGHT TO\", \"WOULD PROBABLY\", \"MAY WISH TO\",\r\n\"COULD\", \"POSSIBLE\", and \"MIGHT\" in this document are to be\r\ninterpreted as described in RFC 6919.","pub_date":"1 April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6919","errata_url":null}
