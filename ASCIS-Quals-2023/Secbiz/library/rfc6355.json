DUID-UUIDs are derived from the already-standardized\r\nUniversally Unique IDentifier (UUID) format.  DUID-UUID\r\nmakes it possible for devices to use UUIDs to identify themselves to\r\nDHC servers and vice versa.  UUIDs are globally unique and readily\r\navailable on many systems, making them convenient identifiers to\r\nleverage within DHCP.
