{"draft":"draft-irtf-tmrg-metrics-11","doc_id":"RFC5166","title":"Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control Mechanisms","authors":["S. Floyd, Ed."],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"23","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IRTF","abstract":"This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an\r\nevaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the\r\nInternet.  These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport\r\nprotocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level\r\ncongestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms\r\nin the router.  This document is the first in a series of documents\r\naimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of\r\ntransport protocols.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group\r\n(TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the\r\nResearch Group (RG).  As the document tries to make clear, there is\r\nnot necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the\r\nIETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or\r\nany other community) about the metrics that congestion control\r\nmechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs\r\nbetween throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and\r\nthe like.  However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that\r\ncongestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of\r\ntrade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of\r\noptimizing for a single metric.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2008","keywords":["transport protocol","transport modeling research group","tmrg"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5166","errata_url":null}
