Application-specific adaptations extend that framework.\r\nPrevious work has focused on HTTP and work for SMTP is in progress.\r\nThese protocols differ fundamentally in the way data flows, and it\r\nturns out that existing OPES requirements and IAB considerations for\r\nOPES need to be reviewed with regards to how well they fit for SMTP\r\nadaptation.  This document analyzes aspects about the integrity of\r\nSMTP and mail message adaptation by OPES systems and about privacy and\r\nsecurity issues when the OPES framework is adapted to SMTP.  It also lists\r\nrequirements that must be considered when creating the \"SMTP\r\nadaptation with OPES\" document.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this document is to capture this information before the\r\ncurrent OPES working group shuts down.  This is to provide input for\r\nsubsequent working groups or individual contributors that may pick up\r\nthe OPES\/SMTP work at a later date.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2007","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4902","errata_url":null}
