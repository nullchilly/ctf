In order for the home agent to be able to initiate\r\ninteractions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this document\r\ndefines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6.  Flow\r\nbindings initiated by a home agent are supported for mobile nodes\r\nenabled by both IPv4 and IPv6.","pub_date":"February 2014","keywords":["MIPv6","Flow mobility"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7109","errata_url":null}
