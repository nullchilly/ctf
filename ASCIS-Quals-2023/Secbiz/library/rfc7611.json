This technique works effectively as long\r\nas the VRF that exports the route is not on the same Provider Edge\r\n(PE) router as the VRF(s) that imports the route.  However, due to\r\nthe constraints of BGP, it does not work if the two are on the same\r\nPE.  This document describes a modification to BGP allowing this\r\ntechnique to work when the VRFs are on the same PE and to be used in\r\na standard manner throughout an autonomous system.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":["BGP","VPN","L3VPN","Extranet","Well-known","Reserved"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7611","errata_url":null}
