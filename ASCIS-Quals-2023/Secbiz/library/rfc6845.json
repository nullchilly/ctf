Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as Link\r\nState Advertisement (LSA) database synchronization are performed\r\nusing the broadcast model, but the network is represented using the\r\npoint-to-multipoint model in the router-LSAs of the routers connected\r\nto it.  This allows an accurate representation of the cost of\r\ncommunication between different routers on the network, while\r\nmaintaining the network efficiency of broadcast operation.  This\r\napproach is relatively simple and requires minimal changes to OSPF.\r\n\r\nThis document updates both OSPFv2 (RFC 2328) and OSPFv3 (RFC 5340).  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":["[--------]","OSPF","P2MP","Broadcast","Interface"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2328","RFC5340"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6845","errata_url":null}
