Dual-Stack Lite requires pre-configuration of the Dual-Stack\r\nLite Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) tunnel information on\r\nthe Basic Bridging BroadBand (B4) element.  In many networks, the\r\ncustomer profile information may be stored in Authentication,\r\nAuthorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, while client\r\nconfigurations are mainly provided through the Dynamic Host\r\nConfiguration Protocol (DHCP).  This document specifies a new Remote\r\nAuthentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute to carry the\r\nDual-Stack Lite AFTR tunnel name; the RADIUS attribute is defined\r\nbased on the equivalent DHCPv6 OPTION_AFTR_NAME option.  This RADIUS\r\nattribute is meant to be used between the RADIUS server and the\r\nNetwork Access Server (NAS); it is not intended to be used directly\r\nbetween the B4 element and the RADIUS server.
