The API aims to enable interactions between applications\r\nand the multihoming shim layer for advanced locator management, and\r\naccess to information about failure detection and path exploration.\r\n\r\nThis document is based on an assumption that a multihomed host is\r\nequipped with a conceptual sub-layer (hereafter called \"shim sub-\r\nlayer\") inside the IP layer that maintains mappings between\r\nidentifiers and locators.  Examples of the shim are Shim6 and the\r\nHost Identity Protocol (HIP).  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational \r\npurposes.","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["Shim6","HIP","identifier\/locator split"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6316","errata_url":null}
