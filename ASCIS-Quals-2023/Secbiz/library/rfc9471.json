If message\r\nsize constraints prevent the inclusion of all glue records for\r\nin-domain name servers, the server must set the TC (Truncated) flag\r\nto inform the client that the response is incomplete and that the\r\nclient should use another transport to retrieve the full response.\r\nThis document updates RFC 1034 to clarify correct server behavior.","pub_date":"September 2023","keywords":["Glue Record","In-Domain Name Server","Sibling Domain Name Server"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1034"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9471","errata_url":null}
