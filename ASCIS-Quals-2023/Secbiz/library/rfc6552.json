An OF states the outcome of the process\r\nused by a RPL node to select and optimize routes within a RPL\r\nInstance based on the Information Objects available; an OF is not an\r\nalgorithm.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a basic Objective Function that relies only\r\non the objects that are defined in the RPL and does not use any\r\nprotocol extensions.
