A number of differing functional approaches have\r\nbeen developed for this, each having their own specific\r\ncharacteristics.  As these approaches share a similar functional\r\narchitecture and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo\r\nspecifies a DHCPv6 option, whereby a single instance of Customer\r\nPremises Equipment (CPE) can interwork with all of the standardized\r\nand proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6\r\nservices by providing a prioritization mechanism.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":["Provisioning","Softwire","IPv4 over IPv6","IPv4 service continuity","IPv4 address depletion","MAP","MAP-T","MAP-E","DS-Lite","Lightweight 4 over 6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8026","errata_url":null}
