As\r\ndefined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This\r\ndocument defines how Sieve can plug into points in IMAP where\r\nmessages are created or changed, adding the option of user-defined or\r\ninstallation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features\r\nsuch as notifications).  Because this requires future Sieve\r\nextensions to specify their interactions with this one, this document\r\nupdates the base Sieve specification, RFC 5228.
