This profile allows clients\r\n(especially those that are constrained in memory, bandwidth,\r\nprocessing power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and\r\nSubmission to access and submit mail.  This includes the ability to\r\nforward received mail without needing to download and upload the\r\nmail, to optimize submission, and to efficiently resynchronize in\r\ncase of loss of connectivity with the server.\r\n\r\nThe Lemonade Profile relies upon several extensions to IMAP, Sieve,\r\nand Mail Submission protocols.  The document also defines a new IMAP\r\nextension and registers several new IMAP keywords.
