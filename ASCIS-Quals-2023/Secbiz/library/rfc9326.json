This document introduces a\r\nnew IOAM option type (denoted IOAM-Option-Type) called the \"IOAM\r\nDirect Export (DEX) Option-Type\". This Option-Type is used as a\r\ntrigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally aggregated\r\nwithout being pushed into in-flight data packets. The exporting\r\nmethod and format are outside the scope of this document.","pub_date":"November 2022","keywords":["IOAM","Telemetry"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9326","errata_url":null}
