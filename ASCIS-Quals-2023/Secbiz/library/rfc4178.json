GSS-API peers can use this negotiation\r\nmechanism to choose from a common set of security mechanisms.  If per-message integrity services are available on the established\r\nmechanism context, then the negotiation is protected against an\r\nattacker that forces the selection of a mechanism not desired by the\r\npeers.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism replaces RFC 2478 in order to fix defects in that\r\nspecification and to describe how to inter-operate with\r\nimplementations of that specification that are commonly deployed on the\r\nInternet.
