The memo describes a possible\r\ndeployment model where resource-constrained devices sign message\r\nobjects, discusses the availability of cryptographic libraries for\r\nresource-constrained devices, and presents some preliminary\r\nexperiences with those libraries for message signing on resource-\r\nconstrained devices.  Lastly, the memo discusses trade-offs involving\r\ndifferent types of security approaches.","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["IoT","security","integrity","signing","ECC","CoAP","asymmetric","cryptography"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8387","errata_url":null}
