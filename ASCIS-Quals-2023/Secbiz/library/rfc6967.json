This host\r\nidentifier could be used by a remote server to sort packets according\r\nto the sending host.  The host identifier must be unique to each host\r\nunder the same shared IP address.\r\n\r\nThis document analyzes a set of potential solutions for revealing a\r\nhost identifier and does not recommend a particular solution,\r\nalthough it does highlight the hazards of some approaches.","pub_date":"June 2013","keywords":["NAT","Host Identifier"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6967","errata_url":null}
