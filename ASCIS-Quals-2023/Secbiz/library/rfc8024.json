Separately,\r\nnetwork access nodes such as Passive Optical Network (PON) Optical\r\nLine Terminations (OLTs) have evolved to support first-mile access\r\nprotection, where one or more physical OLTs provide first-mile\r\ndiversity to the customer edge.  Multihoming support is needed on the\r\nMPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services.\r\nThis document describes the Multi-Chassis PON (MC-PON) protection\r\narchitecture in MPLS and also specifies the Inter-Chassis\r\nCommunication Protocol (ICCP) extension to support it.","pub_date":"November 2016","keywords":["PON Protection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8024","errata_url":null}
