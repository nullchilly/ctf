As defined and widely deployed today, BGP\r\nhas no mechanisms to distribute alternate paths that are not\r\nconsidered best path between its speakers.  This behavior results in a number\r\nof disadvantages for new applications and services.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this document is to observe that by simply\r\nadding a new session between a route reflector and its client, the Nth best\r\npath can be distributed.  This document also compares existing solutions\r\nand proposed ideas that enable distribution of more paths than just\r\nthe best path.\r\n\r\nThis proposal does not specify any changes to the BGP protocol\r\ndefinition.  It does not require a software upgrade of provider edge (PE)\r\nrouters acting as route reflector clients.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6774","errata_url":null}
