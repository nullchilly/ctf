An in-service, on-demand path segment monitoring\r\nfunction of a transport path is indispensable, particularly when the\r\nservice monitoring function is activated only between endpoints.\r\nHowever, the current segment monitoring approach defined for MPLS\r\n(including the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)) in RFC 6371\r\n\"Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework for MPLS-Based\r\nTransport Networks\" has drawbacks.  This document provides an\r\nanalysis of the existing MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms for the path segment\r\nmonitoring and provides requirements to guide the development of new\r\nOAM tools to support Hitless Path Segment Monitoring (HPSM).","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["HPSM","MPLS","MPLS Transport Profile","mpls-tp","OAM","monitoring","Hitless Path Segment Monitoring","Path Segment Monitoring","HPSM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8256","errata_url":null}
