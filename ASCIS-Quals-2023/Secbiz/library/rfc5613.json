OSPF routers\r\nexchange information on a link using packets that follow a\r\nwell-defined fixed format.  The format is not flexible enough to\r\nenable new features that need to exchange arbitrary data.  This\r\ndocument describes a backward-compatible technique to perform\r\nlink-local signaling, i.e., exchange arbitrary data on a link.  This\r\ndocument replaces the experimental specification published in RFC 4813\r\nto bring it on the Standards Track.","pub_date":"August 2009","keywords":["[--------]","open shortest path first","intra-domain routing"],"obsoletes":["RFC4813"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5613","errata_url":null}
