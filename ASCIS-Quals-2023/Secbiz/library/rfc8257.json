DCTCP extends the\r\nExplicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the\r\nfraction of bytes that encounter congestion rather than simply\r\ndetecting that some congestion has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the\r\nTCP congestion window based on this estimate.  This method achieves\r\nhigh-burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow-\r\nbuffered switches.  This memo also discusses deployment issues\r\nrelated to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP, discusses\r\nthe lack of a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver, and\r\npresents some possible mitigations.  This memo documents DCTCP as\r\ncurrently implemented by several major operating systems.  DCTCP, as\r\ndescribed in this specification, is applicable to deployments in\r\ncontrolled environments like data centers, but it must not be\r\ndeployed over the public Internet without additional measures.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["TCP","ECN","DCTCP","congestion control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8257","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8257"}
