Specifically, this document defines a\r\ngeneral \"LOCATOR\" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP\r\nhost to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be\r\nreached.  This document also defines elements of procedure for\r\nmobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically\r\nchanges the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While\r\nthe same LOCATOR parameter can also be used to support end-host\r\nmultihoming, detailed procedures are left for further study.  This memo defines\r\nan Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2008","keywords":["[--------]","hip","multihoming extensions","mobility extentions","locator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8046"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5206","errata_url":null}
