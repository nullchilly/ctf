Since there may be an\r\ninterruption in the forwarding operation during a reset, it is\r\nuseful to know how long a device takes to resume the forwarding\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset (and\r\nreset time) during benchmarking of forwarding devices and provides\r\nclarity and consistency in reset test procedures beyond what is\r\nspecified in RFC 2544.  Therefore, it updates RFC 2544.  This document\r\nalso defines the benchmarking term \"reset time\" and, only in this,\r\nupdates RFC 1242.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2011","keywords":["operation redundancy failover"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1242","RFC2544"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6201","errata_url":null}
