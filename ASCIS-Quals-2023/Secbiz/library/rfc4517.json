The comparison semantics for values of a\r\nsyntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided\r\nthrough separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an\r\nargument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This\r\ndocument defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in\r\ndefining attributes for LDAP directories.
