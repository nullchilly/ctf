Hardaker"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"65","pub_status":"DRAFT STANDARD","status":"INTERNET STANDARD","source":"Integrated Security Model for SNMP","abstract":"This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network\r\nManagement Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport Layer\r\nSecurity protocol or the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\r\nprotocol.  The TLS and DTLS protocols provide authentication and\r\nprivacy services for SNMP applications.  This document describes how\r\nthe TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of an\r\nSNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an\r\ninteroperable way.\r\n\r\nThis Transport Model is designed to meet the security and operational\r\nneeds of network administrators.  It supports the sending of SNMP\r\nmessages over TLS\/TCP and DTLS\/UDP.  The TLS mode can make use of\r\nTCP's improved support for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode\r\nprovides potentially superior operation in environments where a\r\nconnectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is preferred.  Both TLS and DTLS\r\nintegrate well into existing public keying infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis document also defines a portion of the Management Information\r\nBase (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular,\r\nit defines objects for managing the TLS Transport Model for SNMP. \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["[--------]","dtls","datagram transport layer security","tls transport model","tlstm","SNMP-TLS-TM-MIB"],"obsoletes":["RFC5953"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8996"],"see_also":["STD0078"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6353","errata_url":null}
