LCT is specifically designed to support protocols using\r\nIP multicast, but it also provides support to protocols that use\r\nunicast.  LCT is compatible with congestion control that provides\r\nmultiple rate delivery to receivers and is also compatible with\r\ncoding techniques that provide reliable delivery of content.
