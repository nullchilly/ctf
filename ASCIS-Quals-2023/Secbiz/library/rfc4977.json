Currently, two mobility\r\nmanagement protocols are defined for IPv4 and IPv6.  Deploying both\r\nin a dual stack mobile node introduces a number of problems.\r\nDeployment and operational issues motivate the use of a single\r\nmobility management protocol.  This document discusses such\r\nmotivations.  The document also discusses requirements for the Mobile\r\nIPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol so that they can\r\nsupport mobility management for a dual stack node.
