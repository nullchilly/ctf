This document defines a\r\nset of security requirements for time protocols, focusing on the\r\nPrecision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).\r\nThis document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol\r\npractices, the performance implications of external security\r\npractices on time protocols, and the dependencies between other\r\nsecurity services and time synchronization.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["ptp","precision time protocol","ntp","network time protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7384","errata_url":null}
