This permits it to support much larger Layer 2 topologies,\r\nwith faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh\r\ntopology.  Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical\r\nconnectivity membership, which includes point-to-point,\r\npoint-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint variations.  This\r\nmemo documents the IS-IS changes required to support this IEEE\r\nprotocol and provides some context and examples.
