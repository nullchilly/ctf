Intermediate\r\nnodes are expected to be able to look up that address in their\r\nrouting tables.  However, this\r\nis not possible if the route to the root node is a BGP\r\nroute and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core.  This document\r\nspecifies procedures that enable an\r\nMP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these\r\nprocedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by an\r\naddress that is known to the intermediate nodes and is on the path to\r\nthe true root node.
