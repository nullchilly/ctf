Existing specifications allow a mobile access gateway\r\n(MAG) to separate its control and user plane using the Alternate\r\nCare-of Address mobility option for IPv6 or Alternate IPv4 Care-of\r\nAddress option for IPv4.  However, the current specification does not\r\nprovide any mechanism allowing the local mobility anchor (LMA) to\r\nperform an analogous functional split.  To remedy that shortcoming,\r\nthis document specifies a mobility option enabling an LMA to provide\r\nan alternate LMA address to be used for the bidirectional user-plane\r\ntraffic between the MAG and LMA.  With this new option, an LMA will\r\nbe able to use an IP address for its user plane that is different\r\nthan the IP address used for the control plane.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["Control and User Plane Split","Control and User Plane Separation","LMA User-Plane Address Mobility Option"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7389","errata_url":null}
