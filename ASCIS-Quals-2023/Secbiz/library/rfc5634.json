{"draft":"draft-ietf-dccp-quickstart-05","doc_id":"RFC5634","title":"Quick-Start for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)","authors":["G. Fairhurst","A. Sathiaseelan"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"22","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"Datagram Congestion Control Protocol","abstract":"This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the\r\nDatagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport\r\nprotocol that allows the transmission of congestion-controlled,\r\nunreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended for applications such as\r\nstreaming media, Internet telephony, and online games.  In DCCP, an\r\napplication has a choice of congestion control mechanisms, each\r\nspecified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID).  This document\r\nspecifies general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and\r\nspecific procedures for the use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID 2,\r\nCCID 3, and CCID 4.  Quick-Start enables a DCCP sender to cooperate\r\nwith Quick-Start routers along the end-to-end path to determine an\r\nallowed sending rate at the start of a connection and, at times, in\r\nthe middle of a DCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application-\r\nlimited period).  The present specification is provided for use in\r\ncontrolled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be\r\nintended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global\r\nInternet.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"August 2009","keywords":["[--------]","ccid","congestion control identifier","ccid 2","ccid 3","ccid 4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5634","errata_url":null}
