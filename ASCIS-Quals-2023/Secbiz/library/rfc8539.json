Softwires are an example of such a service.  For DHCPv4\r\nover DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire\r\nmechanisms and deployment scenarios (e.g., RFC 7596 or RFC 7597), the\r\noperator needs to know the IPv6 address that the client will use as\r\nthe source of an IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnel.  This address, in\r\nconjunction with the client's IPv4 address, and (in some deployments)\r\nthe Port Set ID are used to create a binding table entry in the\r\noperator's softwire tunnel concentrator.  This memo defines a DHCPv6\r\noption to convey IPv6 parameters for establishing the softwire tunnel\r\nand a DHCPv4 option (to be used only with DHCP 4o6) to communicate\r\nthe source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and\r\nserver.  It is designed to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address\r\nallocation process.\r\n\r\n\"DHCPv6 Options for Configuration of Softwire Address and Port-Mapped                 \r\nClients\" (RFC 7598) describes a deterministic DHCPv6-based mechanism\r\nfor provisioning softwires.  This document updates RFC 7598, allowing\r\nOPTION_S46_BR (90) to be enumerated in the DHCPv6 client's Option\r\nRequest Option (ORO) request and to appear directly within subsequent\r\nmessages sent by the DHCPv6 server.","pub_date":"March 2019","keywords":["Provisioning","Softwire","DHCP 4o6","IPv4 over IPv6","IPv4 service continuity","IPv4 address depletion","IPv4 over IPv6","MAP","Lightweight 4over6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7598"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8539","errata_url":null}
