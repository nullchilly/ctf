These new attributes allow for\r\nimproved data traffic identification, support of ECN, and minimal\r\nDiameter filter administration.\r\n\r\nRFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) that\r\naccommodates extensions for classification, conditions, and actions.\r\nIt, however, does not support traffic identification for packets using\r\nExplicit Congestion Notification as defined in RFC 3168 and does not\r\nprovide specific actions when the flow(s) described by the\r\nFilter-Rule are congested.\r\n\r\nFurther, a Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact\r\nnumber of flows.  Flow count and other associated data (e.g., packets)\r\nare not captured by accounting applications, leaving administrators\r\nwithout useful information regarding the effectiveness or\r\nappropriateness of the filter definition.\r\n\r\nThe optional attributes defined in this document are forward and\r\nbackwards compatible with RFC 5777.","pub_date":"October 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7660","errata_url":null}
