The document\r\nenumerates the cases where RPL Packet Information (RPI) Option Type\r\n(RFC 6553), RPL Source Route Header (RFC 6554), and IPv6-in-IPv6\r\nencapsulation are required in the data plane. This analysis provides\r\nthe basis upon which to design efficient compression of these\r\nheaders. This document updates RFC 6553 by adding a change to the RPI\r\nOption Type. Additionally, this document updates RFC 6550 by defining\r\na flag in the DODAG Information Object (DIO) Configuration option to\r\nindicate this change and updates RFC 8138 as well to consider the new\r\nOption Type when the RPL Option is decompressed.","pub_date":"April 2021","keywords":["RPL Option","6LoWPAN","RFC 6553"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6553","RFC6550","RFC8138"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9008","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9008"}
