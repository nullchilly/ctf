Many protocols and technologies were not designed\r\nto enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy\r\nextensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6,\r\nhave been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic\r\nprinciples to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what\r\nmakes for a good transition plan.","pub_date":"May 2017","keywords":["transition plan"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8170","errata_url":null}
