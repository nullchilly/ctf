The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the SNMP protocol standards over time.  The major portions of the architecture are an SNMP engine containing a Message Processing Subsystem, a Security Subsystem and an Access Control Subsystem, and possibly multiple SNMP applications which provide specific functional processing of management data.
