The original Abstract follows.\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation\r\nProtocol (SIP).  This extension provides the ability for the called\r\nSIP user agent to identify from whom the call was diverted and why\r\nthe call was diverted.\r\nThe extension defines a general header, Diversion, which conveys the\r\ndiversion information from other SIP user agents and proxies to the\r\ncalled user agent.\r\n\r\nThis extension allows enhanced support for various features,\r\nincluding Unified Messaging, Third-Party Voicemail, and Automatic\r\nCall Distribution (ACD).  SIP user agents and SIP proxies that\r\nreceive diversion information may use this as supplemental\r\ninformation for feature invocation decisions.  This document \r\ndefines a Historic Document for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5806","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5806"}
