    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance
      guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and
      bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e.,
      "jitter"). As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to
      the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical
      network, additional security measures may be needed to secure the
      intended operation of these novel service properties.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2"> This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from
      the perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component
      designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats
      and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service
      properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and
      packet arrival-time violation detection.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-3">This document also addresses security considerations specific to the
      IP and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security
      Considerations sections of those documents.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">A deterministic IP network ("<xref target="RFC8655" format="title" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Deterministic Networking Architecture"/>" <xref target="RFC8655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8655"/>) can carry data flows for real-time applications with
        extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. The bounds on latency defined by DetNet
        (as described in <xref target="RFC9016" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9016"/>) include both worst-case latency
        (Maximum Latency, <xref target="RFC9016" section="5.9.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9016#section-5.9.2" derivedContent="RFC9016"/>) and worst-case jitter (Maximum
        Latency Variation, <xref target="RFC9016" section="5.9.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9016#section-5.9.3" derivedContent="RFC9016"/>). Data flows with deterministic
        properties are well established for Ethernet networks (see Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN),
          <xref target="IEEE802.1BA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE802.1BA"/>); DetNet brings these capabilities to the IP
        network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Deterministic IP networks have been successfully deployed in real-time Operational
        Technology (OT) applications for some years; however, such networks are typically isolated
        from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low. An
        example of such an isolated network is a network deployed within an aircraft, which is "air
        gapped" from the outside world. DetNet specifies a set of technologies that enable creation
        of deterministic flows on IP-based networks of a potentially wide area (on the scale of a
        corporate network), potentially merging OT traffic with best-effort Information Technology
        (IT) traffic, and placing OT network components into contact with IT network components,
        thereby exposing the OT traffic and components to security threats that were not present in
        an isolated OT network. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">These DetNet (OT-type) technologies may not have previously been deployed on a wide area
        IP-based network that also carries IT traffic, and thus they can present security
        considerations that may be new to IP-based wide area network designers; this document
        provides insight into such system-level security considerations. In addition, designers of
        DetNet components (such as routers) face new security-related challenges in providing DetNet
        services, for example, maintaining reliable isolation between traffic flows in an
        environment where IT traffic co-mingles with critical reserved-bandwidth OT traffic; this
        document also examines security implications internal to DetNet components. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet because many of the use cases that
        are enabled by DetNet <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578"/> include control of physical
        devices (power grid devices, industrial controls, building controls, etc.) that can have
        high operational costs for failure and present potentially attractive targets for cyber
        attackers. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet is to provide a
        "converged network", i.e., one that includes both IT traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing
        potentially sensitive OT devices to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually
        because they were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT network,
        for example <xref target="ARINC664P7" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ARINC664P7"/>). Security considerations for OT
        networks are not a new area, and there are many OT networks today that are connected to wide
        area networks or the Internet; this document focuses on the issues that are specific to the
        DetNet technologies and use cases. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">Given the above considerations, securing a DetNet starts with a scrupulously well-designed
        and well-managed engineered network following industry best practices for security at both
        the data plane and controller plane, as well as for any Operations, Administration, and
        Maintenance (OAM) implementation; this is the assumed starting point for the considerations
        discussed herein. Such assumptions also depend on the network components themselves
        upholding the security-related properties that are to be assumed by DetNet system-level
        designers; for example, the assumption that network traffic associated with a given flow can
        never affect traffic associated with a different flow is only true if the underlying
        components make it so. Such properties, which may represent new challenges to component
        designers, are also considered herein. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">Starting with a "well-managed network", as noted above, enables us to exclude some of the
        more powerful adversary capabilities from the Internet Threat Model of <xref target="BCP72" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BCP72"/>, such as the ability to arbitrarily drop or delay any or all traffic.
        Given this reduced attacker capability, we can present security considerations based on
        attacker capabilities that are more directly relevant to a DetNet.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">In this context, we view the "conventional" (i.e., non-time-sensitive) network design and
        management aspects of network security as being primarily concerned with preventing denial
        of service, i.e., they must ensure that DetNet traffic goes where it's supposed to and that
        an external attacker can't inject traffic that disrupts the delivery timing assurance of the
        DetNet. The time-specific aspects of DetNet security presented here take up where those
        "conventional" design and management aspects leave off. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-9">However, note that "conventional" methods for mitigating (among all the others)
        denial-of-service attacks (such as throttling) can only be effectively used in a DetNet when
        their use does not compromise the required time-sensitive or behavioral properties required
        for the OT flows on the network. For example, a "retry" protocol is typically not going to
        be compatible with a low-latency (worst-case maximum latency) requirement; however, if in a
        specific use case and implementation such a retry protocol is able to meet the timing
        constraints, then it may well be used in that context. Similarly, if common security
        protocols such as TLS/DTLS or IPsec are to be used, it must be verified that their
        implementations are able to meet the timing and behavioral requirements of the
        time-sensitive network as implemented for the given use case. An example of "behavioral
        properties" might be that dropping of more than a specific number of packets in a row is not
        acceptable according to the service level agreement.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-10">The exact security requirements for any given DetNet are necessarily specific to the use
        cases handled by that network. Thus, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the specific
        security requirements of their use cases, for example, those outlined in the DetNet Use
        Cases <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578"/> and the Security Considerations sections of
        the DetNet documents applicable to the network technologies in use, for example, <xref target="RFC8939" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8939"/> for an IP data plane and <xref target="RFC8964" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8964"/> for an MPLS data plane. Readers can find a general introduction to the
        DetNet Architecture in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8655"/>, the DetNet Data Plane in
          <xref target="RFC8938" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8938"/>, and the Flow Information Model in <xref target="RFC9016" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9016"/>.</t>

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-13">This document includes sections considering DetNet component design as well as system
        design. The latter includes a taxonomy and analysis of threats, threat impacts and
        mitigations, and an association of attacks with use cases (based on <xref target="RFC8578" sectionFormat="of" section="11" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8578#section-11" derivedContent="RFC8578"/>). </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-14">This document is based on the premise that there will be a very broad range of DetNet
        applications and use cases, ranging in size and scope from individual industrial machines to
        networks that span an entire country <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578"/>. Thus, no
        single set of prescriptions (such as exactly which mitigation should be applied to which
        segment of a DetNet) can be applicable to all of them, and indeed any single one that we
        might prescribe would inevitably prove impractical for some use case, perhaps one that does
        not even exist at the time of this writing. Thus, we are not prescriptive here; we are
        stating the desired end result, with the understanding that most DetNet use cases will
        necessarily differ from each other, and there is no "one size fits all". </t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-1">A DetNet system security designer relies on the premise that any resources allocated to
            a resource-reserved (OT-type) flow are inviolable; in other words, there is no physical
            possibility within a DetNet component that resources allocated to a given DetNet flow
            can be compromised by any type of traffic in the network. This includes malicious
            traffic as well as inadvertent traffic such as might be produced by a malfunctioning
            component, or due to interactions between components that were not sufficiently tested
            for interoperability. From a security standpoint, this is a critical assumption, for
            example, when designing against DoS attacks. In other words, with correctly designed
            components and security mechanisms, one can prevent malicious activities from impacting
            other resources.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-2">However, achieving the goal of absolutely inviolable flows may not be technically or
            economically feasible for any given use case, given the broad range of possible use
            cases (e.g., <xref target="RFC8578" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8578"/>) and their associated security considerations as
            outlined in this document. It can be viewed as a continuum of security requirements,
            from isolated ultra-low latency systems that may have little security vulnerability
            (such as an industrial machine) to broadly distributed systems with many possible attack
            vectors and OT security concerns (such as a utility network). Given this continuum, the
            design principle employed in this document is to specify the desired end results,
            without being overly prescriptive in how the results are achieved, reflecting the

            cases. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-3">For example, the component may include traffic shaping and policing at the ingress to
            prevent corrupted, malicious, or excessive packets from entering the network, thereby

            component may include integrity protection for some or all of the header fields such as
            those used for flow ID, thereby decreasing the likelihood that a packet whose flow ID
            has been compromised might be directed into a different flow path. The component may
            verify every single packet header at every forwarding location, or only at certain
            points. In any of these cases, the component may use dynamic performance analytics
              (<xref target="DpaMitigation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.7"/>) to cause action to be initiated to
            address the situation in an appropriate and timely manner, either at the data plane or
            controller plane, or both in concert. The component's software and hardware may include
            measures to ensure the integrity of the resource allocation/deallocation process. Other
            design aspects of the component may help ensure that the adverse effects of malicious
            traffic are more limited, for example, by protecting network control interfaces or
            minimizing cascade failures. The component may include features specific to a given use

            similar intended functionality, but designed for highly secure or otherwise critical
            applications, perhaps at substantially higher cost. Any given component is designed for
            some set of use cases and accordingly will have certain limitations on its security
            properties and vulnerabilities. It is thus the responsibility of the system designer to
            assure themselves that the components they use in their design are capable of satisfying

            compromised and thus may incidentally match the flow ID of another ("victim") DetNet
            flow, resulting in additional unauthorized traffic on the victim, the documentation

            cause starvation of the other flows. Thus, simply providing and enforcing the calculated

          part of a flow) based exclusively on statistical path usage metrics, or due to malicious
          activity, it is possible that the new path would have a latency that is outside the

        of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field of the Type of Service (IPv4) and
        Traffic Class (IPv6) bytes for flow identification. However, the DetNet interpretation of
        the DSCP value for OT traffic is not equivalent to the per-hop behavior (PHB) selection
        behavior as defined by Diffserv. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">Thus, security considerations for DetNet have some aspects in common with Diffserv, in fact
        overlapping 100% with respect to IP IT traffic. Security considerations for these aspects
        are part of the existing literature on IP network security, specifically the Security
        Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/> and <xref target="RFC2475" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2475"/>. However, DetNet also introduces timing and other

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">In the case of DetNet OT traffic, the DSCP value is interpreted differently than in
        Diffserv and contributes to determination of the service provided to the packet. In DetNet,
        there are similar consequences to Diffserv for lack of detection of, or incorrect handling
        of, packets with mismarked DSCP values, and many of the points made in the Diffserv Security
        discussions (<xref target="RFC2475" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2475#section-6.1" derivedContent="RFC2475"/>,

        relevant to DetNet OT traffic though perhaps in modified form. For example, in DetNet, the
        effect of an undetected or incorrectly handled maliciously mismarked DSCP field in an OT
        packet is not identical to affecting the PHB of that packet, since DetNet does not use the
        PHB concept for OT traffic. Nonetheless, the service provided to the packet could be
        affected, so mitigation measures analogous to those prescribed by Diffserv would be
        appropriate for DetNet. For example, mismarked DSCP values should not cause failure of
        network nodes. The remarks in <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/> regarding IPsec and
        Tunneling Interactions are also relevant (though this is not to say that other sections are
        less relevant). </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">In this discussion, interpretation (and any possible intentional re-marking) of the DSCP
        values of packets destined for DetNet OT flows is expected to occur at the ingress to the
        DetNet domain; once inside the domain, maintaining the integrity of the DSCP values is
        subject to the same handling considerations as any other field in the packet.</t>

            DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the flow. Alternatively, the

            DetNet flow. The potential consequence is that the DetNet flow resource allocation

          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.2.3-1">DetNet components are expected to split their resources between DetNet flows in a way
            that prevents traffic from one DetNet flow from affecting the performance of other
            DetNet flows and also prevents non-DetNet traffic from affecting DetNet flows. However,
            perhaps due to implementation constraints, some resources may be partially shared, and
            an attacker may try to exploit this property. For example, an attacker can inject
            traffic in order to exhaust network resources such that DetNet packets that share
            resources with the injected traffic may be dropped or delayed. Such injected traffic may
            be part of DetNet flows or non-DetNet traffic.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-5.2.3-2">Another example of a Resource Segmentation attack is the case in which an attacker is
            able to overload the exception path queue on the router, i.e., a "slow path" typically
            taken by control or OAM packets that are diverted from the data plane because they
            require processing by a CPU. DetNet OT flows are typically configured to take the "fast
            path" through the data plane to minimize latency. However, if there is only one queue
            from the forwarding Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to the exception
            path, and for some reason the system is configured such that any DetNet packets must be
            handled on this exception path, then saturating the exception path could result in the
            delaying or dropping of DetNet packets. </t>

                example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a higher value S+C, where C
                is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker creates a false illusion that the attacked

                favor of the attacked path. Once the flow from the compromised path is favored by

                is now possible for the attacker to either replace en route packets with malicious

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-1">When designing security for a DetNet, as with any network, it may be prohibitively
        expensive or technically infeasible to thoroughly protect against every possible threat.
        Thus, the security designer must be informed (for example, by an application domain expert
        such as a product manager) regarding the relative significance of the various threats and
        their impact if a successful attack is carried out. In this section, we present an example
        of a possible template for such a communication, culminating in a table (<xref target="ThreatIndustryMapping" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Table 2"/>) that lists a set of threats under
        consideration, and some values characterizing their relative impact in the context of a
        given industry. The specific threats, industries, and impact values in the table are
        provided only as an example of this kind of assessment and its communication; they are not
        intended to be taken literally.</t>

        assume that the associated mitigation is not present or has failed. Mitigations are
        discussed in <xref target="ThreatMitigation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-3"> In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be measured in loss
        of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information. In the case of OT or time
        sensitive networks (though not to the exclusion of IT or non-time-sensitive networks), the
        impact of an exploit can also include failure or malfunction of mechanical and/or other
        physical systems. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-4">DetNet raises these stakes significantly for OT applications, particularly those that may

      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-6">Aspects of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects of Failure,
        Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of failure summarizes the
        seriousness of the impact. The impact of a resulting failure can affect many different
        metrics that vary greatly in scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of variables,
        only the following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, Effect on a Single
        Organization, and Effect on Multiple Organizations. Recovery outlines how long it would take
        for an affected use case to get back to its pre-failure state (Recovery Time Objective, RTO)
        and how much of the original service would be lost in between the time of service failure
        and recovery to original state (Recovery Point Objective, RPO). DetNet dependence maps how
        much the following DetNet service objectives contribute to impact of failure: time
        dependency, data integrity, source node integrity, availability, and latency/jitter.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-6-7">The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use cases, there may be
        a multitude of specific applications in which DetNet is used. For simplicity, this section
        attempts to average the varied impacts of different applications. This section does not
        address the overall risk of a certain impact that would require the likelihood of a failure
        happening. </t>

              header has been modified (maliciously or otherwise) and if so, take some appropriate
              action (as discussed in <xref target="DpaMitigation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.7"/>). The decision
              on where in the network to apply integrity protection is part of the DetNet system
              design, and the implementation of the protection method itself is a part of a DetNet
              component design.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1.2.2">The most common technique for detecting header modification is
            the use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) (see <xref target="TechnologySpecificThreats" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 10"/> for
            examples). The MAC can be distributed either in line (included in
            the same packet) or via a side channel. Of these, the in-line
            method is generally preferred due to the low latency that may be
            required on DetNet flows and the relative complexity and
            computational overhead of a sideband approach. </t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1.2.3"> There are different levels of security available for integrity
            protection, ranging from the basic ability to detect if a header
            has been corrupted in transit (no malicious attack) to stopping a
            skilled and determined attacker capable of both subtly modifying
            fields in the headers as well as updating an unkeyed
            checksum. Common for all are the 2 steps that need to be performed
            in both ends. The first is computing the checksum or MAC. The
            corresponding verification step must perform the same steps before
            comparing the provided with the computed value. Only then can the
            receiver be reasonably sure that the header is authentic.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1.2.4"> The most basic protection mechanism consists of computing a
            simple checksum of the header fields and providing it to the next
            entity in the packets path for verification. Using a MAC combined
            with a secret key provides the best protection against
            Modification and Replication attacks (see Sections <xref target="ModificationThreat" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="5.2.2"/> and <xref target="ReplicationThreat" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="5.2.4"/>). This MAC usage
            needs to be part of a security association that is established and
            managed by a security association protocol (such as IKEv2 for
            IPsec security associations). Integrity protection in the
            controller plane is discussed in <xref target="ControllerProtectSection" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.6"/>. The secret
            key, regardless of the MAC used, must be protected from falling
            into the hands of unauthorized users. Once key management becomes
            a topic, it is important to understand that this is a delicate
            process and should not be undertaken lightly. BCP 107 <xref target="BCP107" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BCP107"/> provides best practices in this
            regard.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1.2.5"> DetNet system and/or component designers need to be aware of
            these distinctions and enforce appropriate integrity-protection
            mechanisms as needed based on a threat analysis. Note that adding
            integrity-protection mechanisms may introduce latency; thus, many

            component that removes the sequence number. The sequence number
            may be end-to-end source to destination, or it may be
            added/deleted by network edge components. The adder and remover(s)
            have the trust relationship because they are the ones that ensure
            that the sequence numbers are not modifiable. Thus, sequence
            numbers can be protected by using authenticated encryption or by a
            MAC without using encryption. Between the adder and remover there
            may or may not be replication and elimination functions. The

          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-1">Any compute time that is required for encryption and decryption processing ("crypto")
            must be included in the flow latency calculations. Thus, cryptographic algorithms used in a
            DetNet must have bounded worst-case execution times, and these values must be used in
            the latency calculations. Fortunately, encryption and decryption operations typically
            are designed to have constant execution times in order to avoid side channel leakage. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-2">Some cryptographic algorithms are symmetric in encode/decode time (such as AES), and others
            are asymmetric (such as public key algorithms). There are advantages and disadvantages
            to the use of either type in a given DetNet context. The discussion in this document
            relates to the timing implications of crypto for DetNet; it is assumed that integrity
            considerations are covered elsewhere in the literature.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-3">Asymmetrical crypto is typically not used in networks on a packet-by-packet basis due
            to its computational cost. For example, if only endpoint checks or checks at a small
            number of intermediate points are required, asymmetric crypto can be used to
            authenticate distribution or exchange of a secret symmetric crypto key; a successful
            check based on that key will provide traffic origin verification as long as the key is
            kept secret by the participants. TLS (v1.3 <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446"/>, in
            particular, Section <xref target="RFC8446" sectionFormat="bare" section="4.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.1" derivedContent="RFC8446">"Key
              Exchange Messages"</xref>) and IKEv2 <xref target="RFC6071" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6071"/> are
            examples of this for endpoint checks.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-4">However, if secret symmetric keys are used for this purpose, the key must be given to
            all relays, which increases the probability of a secret key being leaked. Also, if any
            relay is compromised or faulty, then it may inject traffic into the flow. Group key
            management protocols can be used to automate management of such symmetric keys; for an
            example in the context of IPsec, see <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPSECME-G-IKEV2"/>. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-5">Alternatively, asymmetric crypto can provide traffic origin verification at every
            intermediate node. For example, a DetNet flow can be associated with an (asymmetric)
            keypair, such that the private key is available to the source of the flow and the public
            key is distributed with the flow information, allowing verification at every node for
            every packet. However, this is more computationally expensive. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-6">In either case, origin verification also requires replay detection as part of the
            security protocol to prevent an attacker from recording and resending traffic, e.g., as
            a denial-of-service attack on flow forwarding resources.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-7.5.1-7">In the general case, cryptographic hygiene requires the generation of new keys during
            the lifetime of an encrypted flow (e.g., see <xref target="RFC4253" sectionFormat="of" section="9" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4253#section-9" derivedContent="RFC4253"/>), and any such key generation (or key exchange)
            requires additional computing time, which must be accounted for in the latency
            calculations for that flow. For modern ECDH (Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman)
            key-exchange operations (such as x25519 <xref target="RFC7748" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7748"/>),
            these operations can be performed in constant (predictable) time; however, this is not
            universally true (for example, for legacy RSA key exchange <xref target="RFC4432" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4432"/>). Thus, implementers should be aware of the time properties of
            these algorithms and avoid algorithms that make constant-time implementation difficult
            or impossible.</t>

            encryption, authentication, and integrity-protection mechanisms. Compared with data
            flows, the timing constraints for controller and signaling messages may be less strict,
            and the number of such packets may be fewer. If that is the case in a given application,
            then it may enable the use of asymmetric cryptography for the signing of both payload
            and headers for such messages, as well as encrypting the payload. Given that a DetNet is
            managed by a central controller, the use of a shared public key approach for these
            processes is well proven. This is further discussed in <xref target="EncryptionConsiderations" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7.5.1"/>. </dd>

              includes a performance monitoring system to validate that timing guarantees are being
              met and to detect timing violations or other anomalies that may be the symptom of a
              security attack or system malfunction. If this monitoring system detects unexpected
              behavior, it must then cause action to be initiated to address the situation in an

            some centralized network configuration and control system. However, the ability to "hot
            swap" components (e.g., due to malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that
            this kind of behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
            implementation. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-8.1.3-2">An attack surface related to hot swap is that the DetNet network must at least consider
            input at runtime from components that were not part of the initial configuration of the
            network. Even a "perfect" (or "hitless") replacement of a component at runtime would not
            necessarily be ideal, since presumably one would want to distinguish it from the
            original for OAM purposes (e.g., to report hot swap of a failed component). </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-8.1.3-3">This implies that an attack such as Flow Modification, Spoofing, or Inter-segment
            (which could introduce packets from a "new" component, i.e., one heretofore unknown on
            the network) could be used to exploit the need to consider such packets (as opposed to
            rejecting them out of hand as one would do if one did not have to consider introduction
            of a new component).</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-8.1.3-4">To mitigate this situation, deployments should provide a method for dynamic and secure
            registration of new components, and (possibly manual) deregistration and re-keying of
            retired components. This would avoid the situation in which the network must accommodate
            potentially insecure packet flows from unknown components. </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-8.1.3-5">Similarly, if the network was designed to support runtime replacement of a clock
            component, then presence (or apparent presence) and thus consideration of packets from a
            new such component could affect the network, or the time synchronization of the network,
            for example, by initiating a new Best Master Clock selection process. These types of
            attacks should therefore be considered when designing hot-swap-type functionality (see

            Presumably, if the DetNet flow reservation and isolation of the DetNet is well designed
            (better-designed than the attack), then interference with OT traffic should not result

            nonetheless, component and system designers must employ whatever mitigations will meet

      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-1">This section considers DetNet-specific security considerations for packet traffic that is
        generated and transmitted over a DetNet as part of OAM (Operations, Administration, and
        Maintenance). For the purposes of this discussion, OAM traffic falls into one of two basic
        types:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-9-2">
        <li pn="section-9-2.1">OAM traffic generated by the network itself. The additional bandwidth required for such
          packets is added by the network administration, presumably transparent to the customer.
          Security considerations for such traffic are not DetNet specific (apart from such traffic
          being subject to the same DetNet-specific security considerations as any other DetNet data
          flow) and are thus not covered in this document.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-2.2">OAM traffic generated by the customer. From a DetNet security point of view, DetNet
          security considerations for such traffic are exactly the same as for any other customer
          data flows.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-3">From the perspective of an attack, OAM traffic is indistinguishable from DetNet traffic,
        and the network needs to be secure against injection, removal, or modification of traffic of
        any kind, including OAM traffic. A DetNet is sensitive to any form of packet injection,
        removal, or manipulation, and in this respect DetNet OAM traffic is no different. Techniques
        for securing a DetNet against these threats have been discussed elsewhere in this
        document.</t>

        independent of a DetNet implementation. This section considers threats
        specifically related to the IP- and MPLS-specific aspects of DetNet
        implementations. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">The primary security considerations for the data plane specifically
      are to maintain the integrity of the data and the delivery of the
      associated DetNet service traversing the DetNet network. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-3">The primary relevant differences between IP and MPLS implementations
      are in flow identification and OAM methodologies.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">As noted in <xref target="RFC8655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8655"/>, DetNet
      operates at the IP layer <xref target="RFC8939" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8939"/> and
      delivers service over sub-layer technologies such as MPLS <xref target="RFC8964" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8964"/> and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive
      Networking (TSN) <xref target="RFC9023" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9023"/>. Application
      flows can be protected through whatever means are provided by the layer
      and sub-layer technologies. For example, technology-specific encryption
      may be used for IP flows (IPsec <xref target="RFC4301" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4301"/>). For IP-over-Ethernet (Layer 2) flows using an
      underlying sub-net, MACsec <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE802.1AE-2018"/> may be appropriate. For some use cases, packet
      integrity protection without encryption may be sufficient. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-5">However, if the DetNet nodes cannot decrypt IPsec traffic, then
      DetNet flow identification for encrypted IP traffic flows must be
      performed in a different way than it would be for unencrypted IP DetNet
      flows. The DetNet IP data plane identifies unencrypted flows via a
      6-tuple that consists of two IP addresses, the transport protocol ID,
      two transport protocol port numbers, and the DSCP in the IP header. When
      IPsec is used, the transport header is encrypted and the next protocol
      ID is an IPsec protocol, usually Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),
      and not a transport protocol, leaving only three components of the
      6-tuple, which are the two IP addresses and the DSCP. If the IPsec
      sessions are established by a controller, then this controller could
      also transmit (in the clear) the Security Parameter Index (SPI) and thus
      the SPI could be used (in addition to the pair of IP addresses) for flow
      identification. Identification of DetNet flows over IPsec is further
      discussed in <xref target="RFC8939" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1.2.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8939#section-5.1.2.3" derivedContent="RFC8939"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-6">Sections below discuss threats specific to IP and MPLS in more detail.</t>
      <section numbered="true" toc="include" removeInRFC="false" pn="section-10.1">
        <name slugifiedName="name-ip">IP</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-1">IP has a long history of security considerations and architectural protection mechanisms.
          From a data plane perspective, DetNet does not add or modify any IP header information, so
          the carriage of DetNet traffic over an IP data plane does not introduce any new security
          issues that were not there before, apart from those already described in the
          data-plane-independent threats section (<xref target="ThreatSection" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>). </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-2">Thus, the security considerations for a DetNet based on an IP data plane are purely
          inherited from the rich IP security literature and code/application base, and the
          data-plane-independent section of this document. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-3">Maintaining security for IP segments of a DetNet may be more challenging than for the
          MPLS segments of the network given that the IP segments of the network may reach the edges
          of the network, which are more likely to involve interaction with potentially malevolent
          outside actors. Conversely, MPLS is inherently more secure than IP since it is internal to
          routers and it is well known how to protect it from outside influence. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-4">Another way to look at DetNet IP security is to consider it in the light of VPN security.
          As an industry, we have a lot of experience with VPNs running through networks with other
          VPNs -- it is well known how to secure the network for that. However, for a DetNet, we
          have the additional subtlety that any possible interaction of one packet with another can
          have a potentially deleterious effect on the time properties of the flows. So the network
          must provide sufficient isolation between flows, for example, by protecting the forwarding
          bandwidth and related resources so that they are available to DetNet traffic, by whatever
          means are appropriate for the data plane of that network, for example, through the use of
          queuing mechanisms. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.1-5">In a VPN, bandwidth is generally guaranteed over a period of time whereas in DetNet, it
          is not aggregated over time. This implies that any VPN-type protection mechanism must also
          maintain the DetNet timing constraints. </t>

      <section numbered="true" toc="include" removeInRFC="false" pn="section-10.2">

        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.2-1">An MPLS network carrying DetNet traffic is expected to be a "well-managed" network. Given
          that this is the case, it is difficult for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS-encoded packet
          into a network because operators have considerable experience at excluding such packets at
          the network boundaries as well as excluding MPLS packets being inserted through the use of
          a tunnel.</t>

          mechanism; and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management
          systems. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.2-5">The operation of DetNet over an MPLS network builds on MPLS and pseudowire encapsulation.
          Thus, for guidance on securing the DetNet elements of DetNet over MPLS, the reader is also

        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.2-6">Having attended to the conventional aspects of network security, it is necessary to
          attend to the dynamic aspects. The closest experience that the IETF has with securing
          protocols that are sensitive to manipulation of delay are the two-way time transfer (TWTT)
          protocols, which are NTP <xref target="RFC5905" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5905"/> and the Precision Time
          Protocol <xref target="IEEE1588" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE1588"/>. The security requirements for these
          are described in <xref target="RFC7384" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7384"/>. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.2-7">One particular problem that has been observed in operational tests of TWTT protocols is
          the ability for two closely but not completely synchronized flows to beat and cause a
          sudden phase hit to one of the flows. This can be mitigated by the careful use of a
          scheduling system in the underlying packet transport. </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-10.2-8">Some investigations into protection of MPLS systems against dynamic attacks exist, such
          as <xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-opportunistic-encrypt" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MPLS-OPP-ENCRYPT"/>; perhaps
          deployment of DetNets will encourage additional such investigations.</t>

Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>

                <t indent="0">The question often arises of whether a given security system requires some form of automated key management, or whether manual keying is sufficient.  This memo provides guidelines for making such decisions. When symmetric cryptographic mechanisms are used in a protocol, the presumption is that automated key management is generally but not always needed.  If manual keying is proposed, the burden of proving that automated key management is not required falls to the proposer.

   version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management.
   The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key
   management architecture, which contains two components: member
   registration and group rekeying.  Both components require a Group
   Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations
   to authorized members of a group.  The group members then exchange IP
   multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets.  This document
   obsoletes RFC 6407.

              <t indent="0">   This document describes a way to apply opportunistic security between
   adjacent nodes on an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or between end
   points of an LSP.  It explains how keys may be agreed to enable
   encryption, and how key identifiers are exchanged in encrypted MPLS
   packets.  Finally, this document describes the applicability of this
   approach to opportunistic security in MPLS networks with an
   indication of the level of improved security as well as the continued
   vulnerabilities.

This is complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols' traffic.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs.  It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions.  It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous  "IP Security Document Roadmap."</t>
              <t indent="0">The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.
