It uses IPv6's intrinsic ability\r\nto assign multiple addresses to a network interface to provide\r\ncontinuity of network service through a \"make-before-break\"\r\ntransition, as well as addresses naming and configuration management\r\nissues.  It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and\r\ntime required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the\r\nnew prefix.
