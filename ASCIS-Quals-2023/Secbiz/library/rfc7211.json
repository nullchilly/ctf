Developing an operational and management model\r\nfor routing protocol security that works with all the routing\r\nprotocols will be critical to the deployability of these efforts.\r\nThis document gives recommendations to operators and implementors\r\nregarding management and operation of router authentication.  These\r\nrecommendations will also assist protocol designers in understanding\r\nmanagement issues they will face.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7211","errata_url":null}
