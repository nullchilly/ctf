This\r\nrequirement was intended to ensure that a mobile node does not detect\r\nany change with respect to its Layer 3 attachment, even after it\r\nroams from one mobile access gateway to another.  In the absence of\r\nany reserved addresses for this use, coordination across vendors and\r\nmanual configuration of these addresses on all of the mobility\r\nelements in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain are required.  This document\r\nattempts to simplify this operational requirement by making a\r\nreservation for special addresses that can be used for this purpose.\r\nThis document also updates RFC 5213.
