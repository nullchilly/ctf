The\r\nmodel represents the capabilities, state, and configuration of\r\nforwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so\r\nthat control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.  More\r\nspecifically, the model describes the logical functions that are\r\npresent in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how\r\nthese functions are or can be interconnected.  This FE model is\r\nintended to satisfy the model requirements specified in RFC 3654. \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"March 2010","keywords":["[--------]","forwarding element","control element"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7408"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5812","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5812"}
