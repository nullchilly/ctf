The sender sends a single SIP request to a server which\r\nfurther distributes the request to the group.  This SIP request\r\ncontains a list of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which\r\nidentify the recipients of the SIP request.  This URI list is\r\nexpressed as a resource list XML document.  This specification\r\ndefines an XML extension to the XML resource list format that allows\r\nthe sender of the request to qualify a recipient with a copy control\r\nlevel similar to the copy control level of existing email systems.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":["[--------]","XML","copy","control","resource","list"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8996"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5364","errata_url":null}
