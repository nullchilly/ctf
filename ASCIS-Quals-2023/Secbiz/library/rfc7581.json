It is intended that protocol-\r\nspecific documents will reference this memo to describe how\r\ninformation is carried for specific uses.  Such encodings can be used\r\nto extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.  In addition, these\r\nencodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same\r\ninformation to a Path Computation Element (PCE).","pub_date":"June 2015","keywords":["Optical Networks","GMPLS control plane","Wavelength Assignment","Optical LSP","Optical Routing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7581","errata_url":null}
