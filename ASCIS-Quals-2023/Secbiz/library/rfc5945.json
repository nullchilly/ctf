RSVP assumes that both\r\nthe data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP\r\nsignaling.  Yet, there are use cases where resource reservation is\r\nrequired, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable.\r\nThis document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to\r\ninitiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a\r\nsender that is not RSVP-capable.  This allows resource reservations\r\nto be established on a critical subset of the end-to-end path.  This\r\ndocument reviews conceptual approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and\r\ndiscusses how RSVP reservations can be synchronized with application\r\nrequirements, despite the sender, receiver, or both not participating\r\nin RSVP.  This document also points out where extensions to RSVP (or\r\nto other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP\r\nproxy approach.  However, such extensions are outside the scope of\r\nthis document.  Finally, practical use cases for RSVP proxy are\r\ndescribed.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5945","errata_url":null}
