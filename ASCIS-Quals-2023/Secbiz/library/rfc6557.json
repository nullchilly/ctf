The Time Zone\r\n(TZ) Database specifies the indices used in various protocols, as\r\nwell as their semantic meanings, for all localities throughout the\r\nworld.  This database has been meticulously maintained and\r\ndistributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated by a\r\nsingle volunteer who is now planning to retire.  This memo specifies\r\nprocedures involved with maintenance of the TZ database and\r\nassociated code, including how to submit proposed updates, how\r\ndecisions for inclusion of those updates are made, and the selection\r\nof a designated expert by and for the time zone community.  The\r\nintent of this memo is, to the extent possible, to document existing\r\npractice and provide a means to ease succession of the database\r\nmaintainers.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.","pub_date":"February 2012","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0175"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6557","errata_url":null}
