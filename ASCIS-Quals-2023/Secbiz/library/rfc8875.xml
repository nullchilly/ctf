      <t pn="section-1-1">Many IETF working groups and participants make use of GitHub in different ways as part of
their work on IETF documents. Some others are interested in having their working groups
use GitHub to facilitate the development of working group documents, but they are
unfamiliar with how to get started or unclear about which conventions to follow.
Some other working groups use or plan to use other code-repository services
such as GitLab and Bitbucket, which have
different properties than GitHub.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">This document specifies a set of administrative processes and conventions for IETF working
groups to use if they choose as a working group to use GitHub to facilitate their work. The specifications in this document are not directed at working groups or individuals that are
already using GitHub to do IETF work. Practices vary among existing working groups, and
some of them are not consistent with the conventions proposed here: that is fine. The goal
of the specifications in this document is not to require uniformity in current practice, but to
help working groups get started using GitHub in a reviewed and validated way, if desired.</t>

      <t pn="section-2-1">This section specifies an administrative process and conventions to support
the creation and management of GitHub organizations for working groups and single-document
repositories in a uniform way. The steps may be done manually by the IETF Secretariat, or
they may be automated. See
&lt;<eref target="https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-gh-scripts" brackets="none"/>&gt; and
&lt;<eref target="https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template" brackets="none"/>&gt; for working examples of automation
that is in use in some working groups.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">In this document the question of whether processes should be manual or automated is
deliberately left unspecified, since these are implementation details that the IETF Secretariat and Tools Team will address.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">Most of the conventions below are drawn from <xref target="RFC8874" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8874"/>.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-creation-of-github-organiza">Creation of GitHub Organizations</name>
        <t pn="section-2.1-1">This document specifies that there be a facility in the IETF Datatracker
(&lt;<eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/" brackets="none"/>&gt;) interface to allow an area director (AD) or
working group chair to request the creation of a GitHub organization for a
particular working
group. Ideally, this facility would appear both as part of the working group
chartering UI and the working group page UI.</t>
        <t pn="section-2.1-2">When an area director or working group chair makes a request to create a GitHub
organization, the following process would be initiated:</t>

          <li anchor="S3" pn="section-2.1-3.3" derivedCounter="3.">Initialize the organization by designating the IETF Secretariat and the area directors
in the working group's area as owners. If the responsible AD for the working group is from
another area, that AD will be an owner as well.</li>

consist of the working group chairs and working group secretary, if one exists.</li>

administrators are known. Recording GitHub identities in the Datatracker (see
&lt;<eref target="https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/ticket/2548" brackets="none"/>&gt;) would facilitate this. The
person requesting the organization would need to be notified if the GitHub identities of
any of the people meant to be owners or administrators were not available.</t>

        </ul>
        <t pn="section-2.5-3">As an incremental step, this document specifies that there be a facility in the Datatracker
interface to allow an administrator of an ietf-wg-&lt;wgname&gt; organization to request
the creation of a new repository within that organization for a single document. The
document authors would be identified as collaborators. The repository name would be the
draft name. Ideally, the repository would be configured with a skeleton draft file,
default CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, and README files, and continuous integration support, in
the vein of &lt;<eref target="https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template" brackets="none"/>&gt;.
Performing this step would automatically inform the IETF Secretariat that this repository should

license file for open-source repositories. The CONTRIBUTING file can contain other
information as well (see
