Existing OSPF\r\nadvertisements only support advertising link attributes of the L3\r\ninterface. If entities external to OSPF wish to control traffic flows\r\non the individual physical links that comprise the L2 interface\r\nbundle, link attribute information for the bundle members is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThis document defines the protocol extensions for OSPF to advertise\r\nthe link attributes of L2 bundle members. The document also specifies\r\nthe advertisement of these OSPF extensions via the Border Gateway\r\nProtocol - Link State (BGP-LS) and thereby updates RFC 9085.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":["OSPF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC9085"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9356","errata_url":null}
