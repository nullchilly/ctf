Touch"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"19","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Internet Area Working Group","abstract":"The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation and\r\nreassembly and, as currently specified, is required to be unique\r\nwithin the maximum lifetime for all datagrams with a given\r\nsource address\/destination address\/protocol tuple.  If enforced,\r\nthis uniqueness requirement would limit all connections to 6.4 Mbps\r\nfor typical datagram sizes.  Because individual connections\r\ncommonly exceed this speed, it is clear that existing systems\r\nviolate the current specification.  This document updates\r\nthe specification of the IPv4 ID field in RFCs 791, 1122,\r\nand 2003 to more closely reflect current practice and to more\r\nclosely match IPv6 so that the field's value is defined only when a\r\ndatagram is actually fragmented.  It also discusses the impact of\r\nthese changes on how datagrams are used.
