It identifies the rate\r\nat which the IP flows are created, expired, and successfully exported\r\nas a new performance metric in combination with traditional\r\nthroughput.  The metric is only applicable to the devices compliant\r\nwith RFC 5470, \"Architecture for IP Flow Information Export\".  The\r\nmethodology quantifies the impact of the IP flow monitoring process\r\non the network equipment.  This document is not an Internet Standards \r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":["Performance","Flow monitoring","IPFIX","Netflow"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6645","errata_url":null}
