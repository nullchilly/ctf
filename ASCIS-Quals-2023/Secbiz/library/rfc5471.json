This document specifies guidelines for a\r\nseries of tests that can be run on the IPFIX Exporting Process and\r\nCollecting Process in order to probe the conformity and robustness of\r\nthe IPFIX protocol implementations.  These tests cover all important\r\nfunctions, in order to gain a level of confidence in the IPFIX\r\nimplementation.  Therefore, they allow the implementer to perform\r\ninteroperability or plug tests with other IPFIX Exporting Processes\r\nand Collecting Processes.  This memo provides information for the\r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["exporting process","collecting process"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5471","errata_url":null}
