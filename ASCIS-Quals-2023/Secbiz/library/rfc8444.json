BIER also does not require an explicit tree-building\r\nprotocol for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER\r\ndomain at a Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router (BFIR) and leaves the BIER\r\ndomain at one or more Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers (BFERs).  The\r\nBFIR adds a BIER packet header to the packet.  The BIER packet header\r\ncontains a BitString in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to\r\nforward the packet to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast\r\npacket needs to be forwarded is expressed by the set of bits in the\r\nBIER packet header.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the OSPF protocol extension (from RFC 2328)\r\nthat is required for BIER with MPLS encapsulation (which is defined\r\nin RFC 8296).  Support for other encapsulation types and the use of\r\nmultiple encapsulation types are outside the scope of this document.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9272"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8444","errata_url":null}
