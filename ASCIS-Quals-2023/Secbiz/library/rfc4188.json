Provisions are made for the support of transparent bridging.\r\nProvisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges\r\nconnected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.\r\n\r\nThe MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the\r\nBRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2 syntax.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 1493.
