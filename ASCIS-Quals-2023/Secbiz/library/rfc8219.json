More specifically,\r\nthis document targets IPv6 transition technologies that employ\r\nencapsulation or translation mechanisms, as dual-stack nodes can be\r\ntested using the recommendations of RFCs 2544 and 5180.\r\nThe methodology also includes a metric for benchmarking load\r\nscalability.","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":["Single Translation Technologies","Double Translation Technologies","Encapsulation Technologies","NAT64","DNS64","MAP-E","MAP-T","DSLite","464XLAT","6PE","DNS Resolution Performance","Overload Scalability","Typical Latency","Worst Case Latency","PDV","IPDV"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8219","errata_url":null}
