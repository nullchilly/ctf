The framework provides a means to deliver profile data\r\nthat user agents need to be functional, automatically and with\r\nminimal or no User and Administrative intervention.  The framework\r\ndescribes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles,\r\nand receive notifications related to profile modifications.  As part\r\nof this framework, a new SIP event package is defined for\r\nnotification of profile changes.  The framework provides minimal data\r\nretrieval options to ensure interoperability.  The framework does not\r\ninclude specification of the profile data within its scope.
