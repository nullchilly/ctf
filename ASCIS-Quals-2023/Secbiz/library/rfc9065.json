Such\r\nencryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to\r\nthe transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol\r\nossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport\r\nprotocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current\r\noperational practice in some networks inspect transport header\r\ninformation within the network, but this is no longer possible when\r\nthose transport headers are encrypted.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses\r\na protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues to\r\nconsider when designing new transport protocols or features.","pub_date":"July 2021","keywords":["transport design","operations and management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9065","errata_url":null}
