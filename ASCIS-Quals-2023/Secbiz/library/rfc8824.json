SCHC defines a header compression\r\nmechanism adapted for Constrained Devices. SCHC uses a static\r\ndescription of the header to reduce the header's redundancy and size.\r\nWhile RFC 8724 describes the SCHC compression and fragmentation\r\nframework, and its application for IPv6\/UDP headers, this document\r\napplies SCHC to CoAP headers. The CoAP header structure differs from\r\nIPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible header with a variable\r\nnumber of options, themselves of variable length. The CoAP message\r\nformat is asymmetric: the request messages have a header format\r\ndifferent from the format in the response messages. This\r\nspecification gives guidance on applying SCHC to flexible headers and\r\nhow to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient compression Rules.","pub_date":"June 2021","keywords":["header compression","fragmentation","IoT","constrained networks","LPWAN","sensor network","constrained node","wireless sensor network","core","OSCORE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8824","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8824"}
