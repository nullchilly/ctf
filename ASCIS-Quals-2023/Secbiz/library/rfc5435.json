Most of these methods involve polling\r\nto check for new messages periodically.  A push method handled by the\r\nfinal delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves\r\nserver resources.  This document does not specify the notification\r\nmethod, but it is expected that using existing instant messaging\r\ninfrastructure such as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\r\n(XMPP), or Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Short\r\nMessage Service (SMS) messages will be popular.  This document\r\ndescribes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that\r\nallows users to give specific rules for how and when notifications\r\nshould be sent.
