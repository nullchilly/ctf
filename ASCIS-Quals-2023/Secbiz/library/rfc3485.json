The protocol can be compressed by using Signaling Compression (SigComp).  Similarly, the Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based protocol intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. This memo defines the SIP\/SDP-specific static dictionary that SigComp may use in order to achieve higher efficiency.  The dictionary is compression algorithm independent.
