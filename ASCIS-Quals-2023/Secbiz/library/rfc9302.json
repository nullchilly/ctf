This approach is based on associating\r\na version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and transporting such a\r\nversion number in the LISP-specific header of LISP-encapsulated\r\npackets. LISP Map-Versioning is particularly useful to inform\r\ncommunicating Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers\r\n(ETRs) about modifications of the mappings used to encapsulate\r\npackets.  The mechanism is optional and transparent to\r\nimplementations not supporting this feature, since in the\r\nLISP-specific header and in the Map Records, bits used for\r\nMap-Versioning can be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs that do not\r\nsupport or do not want to use the mechanism. \r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6834, which is the initial experimental\r\nspecifications of the mechanisms updated by this document.","pub_date":"October 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6834"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9302","errata_url":null}
