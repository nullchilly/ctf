This\r\ndocument updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified\r\nin \"Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update\"\r\n(RFC 5653).  This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a new output\r\ntoken field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext\r\nor acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has a\r\nchance to emit an error token that can be sent to the peer for\r\ndebugging or informational purpose.  The stream-based GSSContext\r\nmethods are also removed in this version.\r\n\r\nThe GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level\r\nin \"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2,                  \r\nUpdate 1\" (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to\r\nauthenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and\r\nto apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a\r\nper-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for\r\nGSS-API are \"The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM)\"\r\n(RFC 2025) and \"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service                       \r\nApplication Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2\"\r\n(RFC 4121).","pub_date":"May 2018","keywords":["JGSS","GSS-API"],"obsoletes":["RFC5653"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8353","errata_url":null}
