Such associations are known as Calls.\r\n\r\nA Call does not provide the actual connectivity for transmitting user\r\ntraffic, but only builds a relationship by which subsequent\r\nConnections may be made.  In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such Connections\r\nare known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs).\r\n\r\nThis document specifies how GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol -\r\nTraffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling may be used and\r\nextended to support Calls.  These mechanisms provide full and logical\r\nCall\/Connection separation.\r\n\r\nThe mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any\r\nenvironment (including multi-area), and for any type of interface:\r\npacket, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda, or fiber\r\nswitching.
