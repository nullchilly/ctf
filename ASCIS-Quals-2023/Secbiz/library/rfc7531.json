Unlike earlier versions, the\r\nNFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while\r\nintegrating support for file locking and the MOUNT protocol.  In\r\naddition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), COMPOUND\r\noperations, client caching, and internationalization has been added.\r\nOf course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate\r\nwell in an Internet environment.\r\n\r\nRFC 7530 formally obsoletes RFC 3530.  This document, together with\r\nRFC 7530, replaces RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4\r\nprotocol.","pub_date":"March 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7531","errata_url":null}
