The payload format has wide\r\napplicability, as it supports applications from simple low bitrate\r\nconversational usage, to Internet video streaming with interleaved\r\ntransmission, to high bitrate video-on-demand.\r\n\r\nThis memo obsoletes RFC 3984.  Changes from RFC 3984 are summarized\r\nin Section 14.  Issues on backward compatibility to RFC 3984 are\r\ndiscussed in Section 15.
