{"draft":"draft-templin-aero-12","doc_id":"RFC6706","title":"Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO)","authors":["F. Templin, Ed."],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"33","pub_status":"EXPERIMENTAL","status":"EXPERIMENTAL","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g., multicast-\r\ncapable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA), etc.)\r\ncan exchange packets as neighbors on the link, but they may not\r\nalways be provisioned with sufficient routing information for optimal\r\nneighbor selection.  Such nodes should therefore be able to discover\r\na trusted intermediate router on the link that provides both\r\nforwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection\r\nservices to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to\r\nthe final destination.  This redirection can provide a useful route\r\noptimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link\r\nneighbor, to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link\r\nneighbor may be considerably longer than the direct path from ingress\r\nto egress.  However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational\r\nissues on certain link types and\/or in certain deployment scenarios.\r\nThis document therefore introduces an Asymmetric Extended Route\r\nOptimization (AERO) capability that addresses the issues.  This document \r\ndefines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["route","optimize","optimization","redirect","redirection","protocol","routing","link","multi-access","IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6706","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6706"}
