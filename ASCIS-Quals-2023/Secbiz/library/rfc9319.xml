      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6480"/> uses Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) to create a
      cryptographically verifiable mapping from an IP prefix to a set of
      Autonomous Systems (ASes) that are authorized to originate that prefix.
      Each ROA contains a set of IP prefixes and the AS number of one of the
      ASes authorized to originate all the IP prefixes in the set <xref target="RFC6482" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6482"/>.  The ROA is cryptographically signed by the party
      that holds a certificate for the set of IP prefixes.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The ROA format also supports a maxLength attribute. According to
      <xref target="RFC6482" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6482"/>, "When
      present, the maxLength specifies the maximum length of the IP address
      prefix that the AS is authorized to advertise."  Thus, rather than
      requiring the ROA to list each prefix that the AS is authorized to
      originate, the maxLength attribute provides a shorthand that authorizes
      an AS to originate a set of IP prefixes.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">However, measurements of RPKI deployments have found that the use of
      the maxLength attribute in ROAs tends to lead to security problems.
      In particular, measurements taken in June 2017 showed that of the
      prefixes specified in ROAs that use the maxLength attribute, 84% were
      vulnerable to a forged-origin sub-prefix hijack <xref target="GSG17" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GSG17"/>.  The forged-origin prefix or sub-prefix hijack
      involves inserting the legitimate AS as specified in the ROA as the
      origin AS in the AS_PATH; the hijack can be launched against any IP
      prefix/sub-prefix that has a ROA. Consider a prefix/sub-prefix that has
      a ROA that is unused (i.e., not announced in BGP by a legitimate AS). A
      forged-origin hijack involving such a prefix/sub-prefix can propagate
      widely throughout the Internet. On the other hand, if the
      prefix/sub-prefix were announced by the legitimate AS, then the
      propagation of the forged-origin hijack is somewhat limited because of
      its increased AS_PATH length relative to the legitimate announcement. Of
      course, forged-origin hijacks are harmful in both cases, but the extent
      of harm is greater for unannounced prefixes. See <xref target="hijack" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3"/>
      for detailed discussion.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">For this reason, this document recommends that, whenever possible,
      operators <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use "minimal ROAs" that authorize only
      those IP prefixes that are actually originated in BGP, and no other
      prefixes. Further, it recommends ways to reduce the forged-origin attack
      surface by prudently limiting the address space that is included in
      ROAs. One recommendation is to avoid using the maxLength attribute in
      ROAs except in some specific cases. The recommendations complement and
      extend those in <xref target="RFC7115" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7115"/>. The document also discusses
      the creation of ROAs for facilitating the use of DDoS mitigation
      services.  Considerations related to ROAs and RPKI-ROV in the context of
      destination-based Remotely Triggered Discard Route (RTDR) (elsewhere

        Suppose AS 64496 announced 192.168.0.0/16 and has a contract with a

        holds AS 64500.  Further, assume that the DDoS mitigation service
        contract applies to all IP addresses covered by 192.168.0.0/22.  When
        a DDoS attack is detected and reported by AS 64496, AS 64500
        immediately originates 192.168.0.0/22, thus attracting all the DDoS
        traffic to itself.  The traffic is scrubbed at AS 64500 and then sent
        back to AS 64496 over a backhaul link.  Notice that, during a DDoS
        attack, the DDoS mitigation service provider AS 64500 originates a /22
        prefix that is longer than AS 64496's /16 prefix, so all the
        traffic (destined to addresses in 192.168.0.0/22) that normally goes
        to AS 64496 goes to AS 64500 instead.  In some deployments, the
        origination of the /22 route is performed by AS 64496 and announced
        only to AS 64500, which then announces transit for that prefix.  This
        variation does not change the properties considered here.

      possibly even /32 in IPv4 and /128 in IPv6) are announced in BGP.  These

As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community for destination-based blackholing in IP networks.  This well-known advisory transitive BGP community named "BLACKHOLE" allows an origin Autonomous System (AS) to specify that a neighboring network should discard any traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes BGPsec, an extension to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that provides security for the path of Autonomous Systems (ASes) through which a BGP UPDATE message passes.  BGPsec is implemented via an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that carries digital signatures produced by each AS that propagates the UPDATE message.  The digital signatures provide confidence that every AS on the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly authorized the advertisement of the route.</t>
