Upgraded POP and IMAP servers\r\nsupport internationalized messages.  If a POP or IMAP client does not\r\nsupport Email Address Internationalization, a POP or IMAP server\r\ncannot deliver internationalized messages to the client and cannot\r\nremove the message.  To avoid that situation, this document describes\r\na mechanism for converting internationalized messages into the\r\ntraditional message format.  As part of the conversion process,\r\nmessage elements that require internationalized treatment are recoded\r\nor removed, and receivers are able to recognize that they received\r\nmessages containing such elements, even if they cannot process the\r\ninternationalized elements.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":["EAI","Email Address Internationalization","Downgrade","MAIL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6857","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6857"}
