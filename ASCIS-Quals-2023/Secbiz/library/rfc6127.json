The growth of the IPv4 Internet and predicted\r\ndepletion of the free pool of IPv4 address blocks on a foreseeable\r\nhorizon has highlighted an urgent need to revisit IPv6 deployment\r\nmodels.  This document provides an overview of deployment scenarios\r\nwith the goal of helping to understand what types of additional tools\r\nthe industry needs to assist in IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence and\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\nThis document was originally created as input to the Montreal co-\r\nexistence interim meeting in October 2008, which led to the\r\nrechartering of the Behave and Softwire working groups to take on new\r\nIPv4 and IPv6 co-existence work.  This document is published as a\r\nhistorical record of the thinking at the time, but hopefully will\r\nalso help readers understand the rationale behind current IETF tools\r\nfor co-existence and transition.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2011","keywords":["address depletion","translation","NAT-PT","dual-stack","Softwire","Behave","NAT","NAT444"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6127","errata_url":null}
