The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerable\r\nflexibility, and it allows multiple formulations of delay variation\r\nthrough the specification of different packet selection functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough flexibility provides wide coverage and room for new ideas,\r\nit can make comparisons of independent implementations more\r\ndifficult.  Two different formulations of delay variation have come\r\ninto wide use in the context of active measurements.  This memo\r\nexamines a range of circumstances for active measurements of delay\r\nvariation and their uses, and recommends which of the two forms is\r\nbest matched to particular conditions and tasks.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2009","keywords":["active measurement","ipdv","pdv","inter-packet delay variation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5481","errata_url":null}
