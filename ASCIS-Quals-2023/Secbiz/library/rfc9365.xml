    This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of 
    IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). 
    The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
    vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. 
    First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.
    Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current 
    IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility management, as well as
    security and privacy).

    Vehicular networking studies have mainly focused on improving road 
    safety and efficiency and also enabling entertainment in vehicular 
    networks. To proliferate the use cases of vehicular networks, 
    several governments and private organizations have committed to 
    allocating dedicated spectrum for vehicular communications. 
    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US allocated wireless
    channels for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) <xref target="DSRC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DSRC"/> 
    in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with the frequency band of 
    5.850 - 5.925 GHz (i.e., 5.9 GHz band). In November 2020, the FCC adjusted 
    the lower 45 MHz (i.e., 5.850 - 5.895 GHz) of the 5.9 GHz band for 
    unlicensed use instead of DSRC-dedicated use 
    <xref target="FCC-ITS-Modification" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FCC-ITS-Modification"/>. DSRC-based wireless communications
    can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),
    and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking.
    The European Union (EU) allocated radio spectrum for safety-related and 
    non-safety-related applications of ITS with the frequency band of 
    5.875 - 5.905 GHz, as part of the Commission Decision 2008/671/EC
    <xref target="EU-2008-671-EC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EU-2008-671-EC"/>. Most other countries and regions in
    the world have adopted the 5.9 GHz band for vehicular networks, though
    different countries use different ways to divide the band into channels.

    For direct inter-vehicular wireless connectivity, IEEE has amended  
    standard 802.11 (commonly known as Wi-Fi) to enable safe driving services based on DSRC 
    for the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) 
    system. The Physical Layer (L1) and Data Link Layer (L2) issues are addressed 
    in IEEE 802.11p  <xref target="IEEE-802.11p" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE-802.11p"/> 
    for the PHY and MAC layers of the DSRC, while IEEE Std 1609.2 <xref target="WAVE-1609.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WAVE-1609.2"/> 
    covers security aspects, IEEE Std 1609.3 <xref target="WAVE-1609.3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WAVE-1609.3"/> 
    defines related services at network and transport layers, and IEEE Std 1609.4 
    <xref target="WAVE-1609.4" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WAVE-1609.4"/> specifies the multichannel operation. 
    IEEE 802.11p was first a separate amendment but was later rolled into
    the base 802.11 standard (IEEE Std 802.11-2012) as IEEE 802.11 Outside the Context 
    of a Basic Service Set (OCB) in 2012 <xref target="IEEE-802.11-OCB" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE-802.11-OCB"/>.

    This document describes use cases and a problem statement about
    IPv6-based vehicular networking for ITS, which is named IPv6 Wireless Access in 
    Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE).
    First, it introduces the use cases for using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking 
    in ITS.
    Next, for IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of 
    current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, mobility 
    management, as well as security and privacy) so that those protocols 
    can be tailored to IPv6-based vehicular networking. 
    Thus, this document is intended to motivate development of
    key protocols for IPWAVE.

    Cooperative-environment-sensing use cases suggest that vehicles can

    slippery areas by snow or rain, road accidents, traffic congestion,
    and driving behaviors of neighboring vehicles) from various
    vehicle-mounted sensors, such as radars, LiDAR systems, and cameras, with other
    vehicles and pedestrians.
    <xref target="Automotive-Sensing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Automotive-Sensing"/> introduces millimeter-wave 
    vehicular communication for massive automotive sensing. 
    A lot of data can be generated by those sensors, and 
    these data typically need to be routed to different destinations. 
    In addition, from the perspective of driverless vehicles, it is 
    expected that driverless vehicles can be mixed with driver-operated 
    vehicles. Through cooperative environment sensing, driver-operated 
    vehicles can use environmental information sensed by driverless vehicles 
    for better interaction with the other vehicles and environment.
    Vehicles can also share their intended maneuvering information (e.g.,
    lane change, speed change, ramp in-and-out, cut-in, and abrupt braking)
    with neighboring vehicles.
	Thus, this information sharing can help the vehicles behave as more
    efficient traffic flows and minimize unnecessary acceleration and
    deceleration to achieve the best ride comfort.

    malicious party. These dangers can include unauthorized driving control
    input and unauthorized driving information disclosure to an unauthorized
    third party. A malicious party can be a group of hackers, a criminal
    group, and a competitor for industrial espionage or sabotage.  To minimize
    this kind of risk, an augmented identification and verification protocol,
    which has an extra means, shall be implemented based on a basic identity
    verification process. 

   These extra means could include approaches based on certificates,

    The augmented identification and verification protocol with extra means can
    support security properties such as the identification and verification of
    a vehicle, driver, and passenger.  

   First, a credit-based method is when a vehicle classifies the messages it received
   from another host into various levels based on their potential
   effects on driving safety in order to calculate the credit of that sender. 
   Based on accumulated credit, a correspondent node can verify
    the other party to see whether it is genuine or not.  Second, a
     certificate-based method includes a user certificate (e.g., X.509
     certificate <xref target="RFC5280" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5280"/>) to authenticate a vehicle or its
     driver.  Third, a biometric method includes a fingerprint, face, or voice to
     authenticate a driver or passenger.  Lastly, an OTP-based method lets another already-authenticated device (e.g., smartphone and
     tablet) of a driver or passenger be used to authenticate a driver or
     passenger.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-5">
    As shown in <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>, as internal
    networks, a vehicle's mobile network and an EN's fixed network 
    are self-contained networks having multiple subnets and having 
    an edge router (e.g., IP-OBU and IP-RSU) for communication with 
    another vehicle or another EN.  
    The internetworking between two internal networks via V2I communication 
    requires the exchange of the network parameters and the network 
    prefixes of the internal networks. For the efficiency, the network
    prefixes of the internal networks (as a mobile network) in a 
    vehicle need to be delegated and configured automatically. Note
    that a mobile network's network prefix can be called a Mobile
    Network Prefix (MNP) <xref target="RFC3963" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3963"/>. 	
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-6">
    <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/> also shows the internetworking
    between the vehicle's mobile network and the EN's fixed network. 
    There exists an internal network (Mobile Network1) inside Vehicle1. 
    Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and Host2) and two routers (IP-OBU1 
    and Router1).  There exists another internal network (Fixed Network1) 
    inside EN1.  EN1 has one host (Host3), two routers (IP-RSU1 and 
    Router2), and the collection of servers (Server1 to ServerN) for 
    various services in the road networks, such as the emergency 
    notification and navigation.  Vehicle1's IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) 
    and EN1's IP-RSU1 (as a fixed router) use 2001:db8:1:1::/64 for an 
    external link (e.g., DSRC) for V2I networking.
    Thus, a host (Host1) in Vehicle1 can communicate with a server 
    (Server1) in EN1 for a vehicular service through Vehicle1's mobile
    network, a wireless link between IP-OBU1 and IP-RSU1, and EN1's fixed 
    network.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-7">
   	For the IPv6 communication between an IP-OBU and an IP-RSU or between 
    two neighboring IP-OBUs, they need to know the network parameters, 
    which include MAC layer and IPv6 layer information.  
    The MAC layer information includes wireless link-layer parameters, 
    transmission power level, and the MAC address of an external network 
    interface for the internetworking with another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.  
    The IPv6 layer information includes the IPv6 address and network 
    prefix of an external network interface for the internetworking with 
    another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-8">
    Through the mutual knowledge of the network parameters of 
    internal networks, packets can be transmitted between the vehicle's mobile 
    network and the EN's fixed network. Thus, V2I requires an efficient 
    protocol for the mutual knowledge of network parameters. Note that 
    from a security point of view, perimeter-based policy enforcement
    <xref target="RFC9099" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9099"/> 
    can be applied to protect parts of the internal network of a vehicle.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-9">
    As shown in <xref target="fig_v2i-internetworking" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/>, the addresses
    used for IPv6 transmissions over the wireless link interfaces for
    IP-OBU and IP-RSU can be IPv6 link-local addresses, ULAs, or IPv6 global 
    addresses. When IPv6 addresses are used, wireless interface
    configuration and control overhead for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) <xref target="RFC4862" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4862"/> and
    Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) <xref target="RFC2710" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2710"/> <xref target="RFC3810" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3810"/>
    should be minimized to support V2I and V2X communications for vehicles
    moving fast along roadways.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-10">
    Let us consider the upload/download time of a ground vehicle when it passes
    through the wireless communication coverage of an IP-RSU.
    For a given typical setting where 1 km is the maximum DSRC communication
    range <xref target="DSRC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DSRC"/> and 100 km/h is the speed limit on highways for
    ground vehicles, the dwelling time can be calculated to be 72 seconds 
    by dividing the diameter
    of the 2 km (i.e., two times the DSRC communication range where an IP-RSU
    is located in the center of the circle of wireless communication) by
    the speed limit of 100 km/h (i.e., about 28 m/s). For the 72 seconds, a
    vehicle passing through the coverage of an IP-RSU can upload and download
    data packets to/from the IP-RSU. 
    For special cases, such as emergency vehicles moving above the speed limit,
    the dwelling time is relatively shorter than that of other vehicles.
    For cases of airborne vehicles (i.e., aircraft), considering a higher
    flying speed and a higher altitude, the dwelling time can be much shorter.

    However, an ND protocol in
	vehicular networks shall consider more about the geographical mobility
	information of vehicles as an important resource for serving various
	purposes to improve the reliability, e.g., vehicle driving safety, 
	intelligent transportation implementations, and advanced mobility
    services. For a more reliable V2V networking, some redundancy
    mechanisms should be provided in L3 in cases of the failure of L2. 
    For different use cases, the optimal solution to improve V2V networking
    reliability may vary. For example, a group of platooning vehicles may 
    have stabler neighbors than freely moving vehicles, as described in 
    <xref target="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>.

    In order to specify protocols using the architecture mentioned in 
    <xref target="subsection_GP-Vehicular-Network-Architecture" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.1"/>, 
    IPv6 core protocols have to be adapted to overcome certain
    challenging aspects of vehicular networking.  Since the vehicles are
    likely to be moving at great speed, protocol exchanges need to be
    completed in a relatively short time compared to the lifetime of a
    link between a vehicle and an IP-RSU or between two vehicles.  
    In these cases, vehicles may not have enough time either to build 
    link-layer connections with each other and may rely more on 
    connections with infrastructure.  
    In other cases, the relative speed between vehicles 
    may be low when vehicles move toward the same direction or 
    are platooned. 
    For those cases, vehicles can have more time to build and maintain 
    connections with each other.

    For safe driving, vehicles need to exchange application messages
    every 0.5 seconds <xref target="NHTSA-ACAS-Report" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NHTSA-ACAS-Report"/> to let drivers
    take an action to avoid a dangerous situation (e.g., vehicle collision),
    so the IPv6 control plane (e.g., ND procedure and DAD) needs 
    to support this order of magnitude for application message exchanges.
    Also, considering the communication range of DSRC (up to 1 km) and
    100 km/h as the speed limit on highways (some countries can have much 
    higher speed limits or even no limit, e.g., Germany), 
    the lifetime of a link between
    a vehicle and an IP-RSU is in the order of a minute (e.g., about 
    72 seconds), and the lifetime of a link
    between two vehicles is about a half minute. 
    Note that if two vehicles are moving in the opposite directions in
    a roadway, the relative speed of this case is two times the relative
    speed of a vehicle passing through an IP-RSU. 

    This relative speed causes the lifetime of the wireless link between the vehicle and the IP-RSU to be halved.
    In reality, the DSRC communication range is around 500 m, so the link
    lifetime will be half of the maximum time.
    The time constraint of a wireless link between two nodes (e.g., vehicle
    and IP-RSU) needs to be considered because it may affect the lifetime
    of a session involving the link.
    The lifetime of a session varies depending on the session's type,
    such as web surfing, a voice call over IP, a DNS query, or
    context-aware navigation (in <xref target="subsection_V2V-Use-Cases" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1"/>). 
    Regardless of a session's type, to guide all the IPv6 packets to
    their destination host(s), IP mobility should be supported for the
    session. In a V2V scenario (e.g., context-aware navigation
    <xref target="CNP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CNP"/>), the IPv6
    packets of a vehicle should be delivered to relevant vehicles efficiently 
    (e.g., multicasting).
    With this observation, IPv6 protocol exchanges need to be performed as 
    quickly as possible to support the message exchanges of various 
    applications in vehicular networks.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-5-3">
    Therefore, the time constraint of a wireless link has a major impact on
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND). Mobility Management (MM) is also 
    vulnerable to disconnections that occur before the completion of 
    identity verification and tunnel management.  This is especially
    true given the unreliable nature of wireless communication.
    Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the wireless link determined by the
    lower layers (i.e., PHY and link layers) can affect the transmission
    time of control messages of the upper layers (e.g., IPv6) and the
    continuity of sessions in the higher layers (e.g., IPv6, TCP, and UDP).
    Hence, the bandwidth selection according to the Modulation and Coding Scheme
    (MCS) also affects the vehicular network connectivity. Note that usually
    the higher bandwidth gives the shorter communication range and the
    higher packet error rate at the receiving side, which may reduce the
    reliability of control message exchanges of the higher layers (e.g.,
    IPv6). This section presents key topics, such as neighbor discovery and
    mobility management for links and sessions in IPv6-based vehicular
    networks. 
    Note that the detailed discussion on the transport-layer session

    The requirements for IPv6 ND for vehicular networks are efficient
    DAD and NUD operations. An efficient DAD is required to reduce

    road network, which can guarantee the uniqueness of a vehicle's
    global IPv6 address. An efficient NUD is required to reduce the

    of a vehicle in terms of adjacent vehicles and IP-RSUs.

    The legacy DAD assumes that a node with an IPv6 address can reach any
    other node with the scope of its address at the time it claims its address,
    and can hear any future claim for that address by another party within 
    the scope of its address for the duration of the address ownership.
    However, the partitioning and merging of VANETs makes this assumption 
    not valid frequently in vehicular networks.
    The partitioning and merging of VANETs frequently occurs in vehicular 
    networks. 
    This partitioning and merging should be considered for 
    IPv6 ND, such as IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    <xref target="RFC4862" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4862"/>. 
    SLAAC is not compatible with the partitioning and merging, and additional
    work is needed for ND to operate properly under those circumstances.
    Due to the merging of VANETs, two IPv6 addresses may conflict with
    each other though they were unique before the merging. An address
    lookup operation may be conducted by an MA or IP-RSU (as Registrar in
    RPL) to check the uniqueness of an IPv6 address that will be
    configured by a vehicle as DAD.
    Also, the partitioning of a VANET may make vehicles with the same 
    prefix be physically unreachable. An address lookup operation may be
    conducted by an MA or IP-RSU (as Registrar in RPL) to check the
    existence of a vehicle under the network coverage of the MA or IP-RSU
    as NUD.
    Thus, SLAAC needs to prevent IPv6 address duplication due to the
    merging of VANETs, and IPv6 ND needs to detect unreachable neighboring
    vehicles due to the partitioning of a VANET.
    According to the partitioning and merging, a destination vehicle
    (as an IPv6 host) needs to be distinguished as a host that is either
    on-link or not on-link even though the source vehicle can use the
    same prefix as the destination vehicle <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-ippl" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPPL"/>.

    Since the partitioning and merging of vehicular networks may
    require re-performing the DAD process repeatedly, the link scope
    of vehicles may be limited to a small area, which may delay
    the exchange of driving safety messages. Driving safety
    messages can include a vehicle's mobility information (e.g., 
    position, speed, direction, and acceleration/deceleration)
    that is critical to other vehicles.  The exchange interval of
    this message is recommended to be less than 0.5 seconds, which is required

    leaf node moves to the coverage of another parent node, it should

    For using it in IPv6-based vehicular networks, there have not been

    IoT Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN) scenarios. 
    Another concern is that RPL may generate excessive topology discovery

    The seamless connectivity and timely data exchange between 
    two endpoints requires efficient mobility management 
    including location management and handover.
    Most vehicles are equipped with a GNSS receiver as part of 
    a dedicated navigation system or a corresponding smartphone 
    app.  Note that the GNSS receiver may not provide vehicles with 
    accurate location information in adverse environments, such as 
    a building area or a tunnel.  The location precision can be

    With a GNSS navigator, efficient mobility management can
    be performed with the help of vehicles periodically reporting 
    their current position and trajectory (i.e., navigation path) to 
    the vehicular infrastructure (having IP-RSUs and an MA in TCC). 
    This vehicular infrastructure can predict the future positions
    of the vehicles from their mobility information (e.g., the current
    position, speed, direction, and trajectory) for efficient mobility
    management (e.g., proactive handover).  For a better proactive 
    handover, link-layer parameters, such as the signal strength of a 
    link-layer frame (e.g., Received Channel Power Indicator (RCPI) 
    <xref target="VIP-WAVE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="VIP-WAVE"/>), can be used to determine the 
    moment of a handover between IP-RSUs along with mobility

    By predicting a vehicle's mobility, the vehicular infrastructure

    For a mobility management scheme in a domain, where the

    an efficient vehicular-network-wide DAD is required.
    On the other hand, for a mobility
    management scheme with a unique prefix per mobile node (e.g., PMIPv6
    <xref target="RFC5213" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5213"/>),
    DAD is not required because the IPv6 address of a vehicle's external
    wireless interface is guaranteed to be unique. There is a trade-off
    between the prefix usage efficiency and DAD overhead. Thus, the IPv6
    address autoconfiguration for vehicular networks needs to consider
    this trade-off to support efficient mobility management.

    SLAAC for vehicular networks needs to consider the
    minimization of the cost of DAD with the help of an infrastructure
    node (e.g., IP-RSU and MA). Using an infrastructure prefix over VANET
    allows direct routability to the Internet through the multihop V2I toward
    an IP-RSU. On the other hand, a BYOA does not allow such direct
    routability to the Internet since the BYOA is not topologically
    correct, that is, not routable in the Internet. In addition, a
    vehicle configured with a BYOA needs a tunnel home (e.g., IP-RSU)
    connected to the Internet, and the vehicle needs to know which
    neighboring vehicle is reachable inside the VANET toward the tunnel
    home. There is non-negligible control overhead to set up and

    Vehicles and infrastructure must be authenticated to each other by

    For the authentication in vehicular networks, the Vehicular Cloud
    needs to support a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) efficiently, as either

    Even though a vehicle is perfectly authenticated by another entity

    it may be hacked by malicious applications that track and
    collect its and other vehicles' information.  In this case, an

        address for a vehicle's wireless network interface. If the unique
        MAC address of the wireless network interface is used, a hacker
        can track the vehicle with that MAC address and can track the
        privacy information of the vehicle's driver (e.g., location
        information). To prevent this privacy breakage, a MAC address
        pseudonym can be used for the MAC address of the wireless network
        interface, and the corresponding IPv6 address should be based on
        such a MAC address pseudonym.
        By solving a privacy issue of a vehicle's identity in logging,
        vehicles may observe each other's activities to identify any
        misbehaviors without privacy breakage.  Once identifying a 
        misbehavior, a vehicle shall have a way to either isolate itself 
        from others or isolate a suspicious vehicle by informing 
        other vehicles.

        For completely secure vehicular networks, we shall embrace the concept
        of "zero-trust" for vehicles where no vehicle is trustable and
        verifying every message  (such as IPv6 control messages including ND,
        DAD, NUD, and application-layer messages) is necessary.  In this way,
        vehicular networks can defend against many possible cyberattacks. Thus, we
        need to have an efficient zero-trust framework or mechanism for
        vehicular networks.

        For the non-repudiation of the harmful activities from malicious 
        vehicles, as it is difficult for other normal vehicles to identify them,
        an additional and advanced approach is needed. One possible 
        approach is to use a blockchain-based approach 
        <xref target="Bitcoin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Bitcoin"/> as an IPv6 security checking framework. 
        Each IPv6 packet from a vehicle can be treated as a transaction, and the
        neighboring vehicles can play the role of peers in a consensus 
        method of a blockchain <xref target="Bitcoin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Bitcoin"/>
          <xref target="Vehicular-BlockChain" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Vehicular-BlockChain"/>. For a blockchain's efficient 
        consensus in vehicular networks having fast-moving vehicles, either
        a new consensus algorithm needs to be developed, or an existing 
        consensus algorithm needs to be enhanced. 
        In addition, a consensus-based mechanism for the security of 
        vehicular networks in the IPv6 layer can also be considered.
        A group of servers as blockchain infrastructure can be part of 
        the security checking process in the IP layer.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-7">
        To prevent an adversary from tracking a vehicle with its MAC 
        address or IPv6 address, especially for a long-living transport-layer
        session (e.g., voice call over IP and video streaming service),
        a MAC address pseudonym needs to be provided to each vehicle; 
        that is, each vehicle periodically updates its MAC address, and
        the vehicle's IPv6 address needs to be updated accordingly by the MAC
        address change <xref target="RFC4086" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4086"/> <xref target="RFC8981" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8981"/>. 
        Such an update of the MAC and IPv6 addresses should not 
        interrupt the E2E communications between two vehicles (or 
        between a vehicle and an IP-RSU) for a long-living transport-layer
        session.  However, if this pseudonym is performed without strong 
        E2E confidentiality  (using either IPsec or TLS), there will be no
        privacy benefit from changing MAC and IPv6 addresses because an
        adversary can observe the change of the MAC and IPv6 addresses and
        track the vehicle with those addresses. Thus, the MAC address
        pseudonym and the IPv6 address update should be performed with strong
        E2E confidentiality.

        The privacy exposure to the TCC via V2I is mostly about the
        location information of vehicles and may also include other in-vehicle
        activities, such as transactions of credit cards.  The assumed,
        trusted actors are the owner of a vehicle, an authorized vehicle
        service provider (e.g., navigation service provider), and an
        authorized vehicle manufacturer for providing after-sales services.
        In addition, privacy concerns for excessively collecting vehicle
        activities from roadway operators, such as public transportation
        administrators and private contractors, may also pose threats on
        violating privacy rights of vehicles.  It might be interesting to find
        a solution from a technological point of view along with public policy
        development for the issue.

        The "multicasting" of the location information of a VRU's smartphone
        means IPv6 multicasting.  There is a possible security attack related
        to this multicasting.  Attackers can use "fake identifiers" as source
        IPv6 addresses of their devices to generate IPv6 packets and multicast
        them to nearby vehicles in order to cause confusion that those
        vehicles are surrounded by other vehicles or pedestrians.  As a result,
        navigation services (e.g., Google Maps <xref target="Google-Maps" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Google-Maps"/> and Waze <xref target="Waze" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Waze"/>)
        can be confused with fake road traffic by those vehicles or smartphones
        with "fake identifiers" <xref target="Fake-Identifier-Attack" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Fake-Identifier-Attack"/>.  
        This attack with "fake identifiers" should be detected and handled by
        vehicular networks.  To cope with this attack, both legal vehicles and
        legal VRUs' smartphones can be registered with a TCC and their locations
        can be tracked by the TCC.  With this tracking, the TCC can tell the
        road traffic conditions caused by those vehicles and smartphones.
        In addition, to prevent hackers from tracking the locations of those
        vehicles and smartphones, either a MAC address pseudonym
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MAC-ADD-RAN"/>
        or secure IPv6 address generation <xref target="RFC7721" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7721"/>

Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

              <t indent="0">   This document describes a way, called Forwarding Policy Configuration
   (FPC) to manage the separation of data-plane and control-plane.  FPC
   defines a flexible mobility management system using FPC agent and FPC
   client functions.  A FPC agent provides an abstract interface to the
   data-plane.  The FPC client configures data-plane nodes by using the
   functions and abstractions provided by the FPC agent for the data-
   plane nodes.  The data-plane abstractions presented in this document
   are extensible in order to support many different types of mobility
   management systems and data-plane functions.

              <t indent="0">   IP makes certain assumptions about the L2 forwarding behavior of a

   Private VLANs that violate some of those assumptions.  This document
   specifies that link behavior and how IP handles links with those

              <t indent="0">   To limit the privacy and security issues created by the association
   between a device, its traffic, its location and its user, client
   vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation.  When such
   rotation happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect
   network efficiency and the user experience.  At the same time,
   devices may continue sending other stable identifiers, defeating the
   MAC rotation purposes.  This document lists various network
   environments and a set of functional network services that may be
   affected by such rotation.  This document then examines settings
   where the user experience may be affected by in-network state
   disruption, and settings where other machine identifiers may help re-
   identify the user or recover the identity of the user, and locate the
   device and its associated user.  Last, this document examines
   solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of
   experience and network operation efficiency.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN.  The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs).  MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message.  In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs.  Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This information is then used for route calculation.  OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.</t>

MLD is used by an IPv6 router to discover the presence of multicast listeners on directly attached links, and to discover which multicast addresses are of interest to those neighboring nodes.  MLDv2 is designed to be interoperable with MLDv1.  MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to report interest in listening to packets with a particular multicast address only from specific source addresses or from all sources except for specific source addresses.

The protocol is an extension of Mobile IPv6 and allows session continuity for every node in the Mobile Network as the network moves.  It also allows every node in the Mobile Network to be reachable while moving around.  The Mobile Router, which connects the network to the Internet, runs the NEMO Basic Support protocol with its Home Agent.  The protocol is designed so that network mobility is transparent to the nodes inside the Mobile Network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential number space.</t>
              <t indent="0">Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

This sub-optimal routing results in various inefficiencies associated with packet delivery, such as increased delay and bottleneck links leading to traffic congestion, which can ultimately disrupt all communications to and from the Mobile Network Nodes.  Additionally, with nesting of Mobile Networks, these inefficiencies get compounded, and stalemate conditions may occur in specific dispositions.

              <t indent="0">This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.

              <t indent="0">Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover the actual number of machines on the subnet. In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be unassigned. Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses. Such denial-of-service attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker) or result from legitimate operational tools or accident conditions. As a result of these vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6 transported flows may be interrupted.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document describes the potential for DoS in detail and suggests possible implementation improvements as well as operational mitigation techniques that can, in some cases, be used to protect against or at least alleviate the impact of such attacks.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold while still retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from the HELLO message exchange. This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently.</t>
              <t indent="0">NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors. However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor ceases being symmetric, including while "ignored" (as described above), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen.  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC 4861.</t>

              <t indent="0">When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions.  In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions.  This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.</t>

This is a robust method for Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) for datagram Packetization Layers (PLs). It allows a PL, or a datagram application that uses a PL, to discover whether a network path can support the current size of datagram. This can be used to detect and reduce the message size when a sender encounters a packet black hole. It can also probe a network path to discover whether the maximum packet size can be increased. This provides functionality for datagram transports that is equivalent to the PLPMTUD specification for TCP, specified in RFC 4821, which it updates. It also updates the UDP Usage Guidelines to refer to this method for use with UDP datagrams and updates SCTP.</t>

The new extension is called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.</t>

    Vehicular networks may consist of multiple radio technologies, such as 
    DSRC and 5G V2X (or LTE V2X).  Although a Layer 2 solution can provide support for 
    multihop communications in vehicular networks, the scalability issue 
    related to multihop forwarding still remains when vehicles need to 
    disseminate or forward packets toward destinations that are multiple hops away.  In 
    addition, the IPv6-based approach for V2V as a network-layer protocol can 
    accommodate multiple radio technologies as MAC protocols, such as DSRC and 
    5G V2X (or LTE V2X). Therefore, the existing IPv6 protocol can be augmented through the 
    addition of a virtual interface (e.g., OMNI 
    <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-omni" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OMNI"/> 
    and DLEP <xref target="RFC8175" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8175"/>) and/or 
    protocol changes in order to support both wireless single-hop/multihop V2V 
    communications and multiple radio technologies in vehicular networks.
    In such a way, vehicles can communicate with each other by V2V 
    communications to share either an emergency situation or road hazard 
    information on a highway having multiple radio technologies.

    <xref target="RFC6550" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6550"/> and Overlay Multilink Network

    RPL defines an IPv6 routing protocol for Low-Power and Lossy 
    Networks (LLNs) as being mostly designed for home automation routing, 
    building automation routing, industrial routing, and urban 
    LLN routing. It uses a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DODAG) to construct routing paths for hosts
    (e.g., IoT devices) in a network. The DODAG uses an Objective
    Function (OF) for route selection and optimization within the
    network. A user can use different routing metrics to define an OF
    for a specific scenario. RPL supports multipoint-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point traffic; and the major
    traffic flow is the multipoint-to-point traffic. For example, in
    a highway scenario, a vehicle may not access an IP-RSU directly
    because of the distance of the DSRC coverage (up to 1 km). In
    this case, the RPL can be extended to support a multihop V2I
    since a vehicle can take advantage of other vehicles as relay
    nodes to reach the IP-RSU. Also, RPL can be extended to support both
    multihop V2V and V2X in the similar way.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-3">
    RPL is primarily designed to minimize the control plane activity,
    which is the relative amount of routing protocol exchanges versus data
    traffic; this approach is beneficial for situations where the power
    and bandwidth are scarce (e.g., an IoT LLN where RPL is typically 
    used today), but also in situations of high relative mobility between 
    the nodes in the network (also known as swarming, e.g., within a variable set of 
    vehicles with a similar global motion, or a variable set of drones flying 
    toward the same direction).
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-4">
    To reduce the routing exchanges, RPL leverages a Distance Vector (DV) 
    approach, which does not need a global knowledge of the topology, 
    and only optimizes the routes to and from the root, allowing 
    peer-to-peer (P2P) paths to be stretched. Although RPL installs its
    routes proactively, it only maintains them lazily, that is, in
    reaction to actual traffic or as a slow background activity.
    Additionally, RPL leverages the concept of an OF,
    which allows adapting the activity of the routing
    protocol to use cases, e.g., type, speed, and quality of the
    radios. RPL does not need to converge and provides connectivity to 
    most nodes most of the time. The default route toward the root is
    maintained aggressively and may change while a packet progresses
    without causing loops, so the packet will still reach the root.

    There are two modes for routing in RPL: non-storing mode
    and storing mode. In non-storing mode, a node inside the
    mesh or swarm that changes its point(s) of attachment to the graph
    informs the root with a single unicast packet flowing along the
    default route, and the connectivity is restored immediately; this
    mode is preferable for use cases where Internet connectivity is
    dominant. On the other hand, in storing mode, the routing stretch
    is reduced for better P2P connectivity, and the Internet
    connectivity is restored more slowly during the time for the DV
    operation to operate hop-by-hop. While an RPL topology can
    quickly scale up and down and fit the needs of mobility of
    vehicles, the total performance of the system will also depend on
    how quickly a node can form an address, join the mesh (including
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)), and manage
    its global mobility to become reachable from another node outside
    the mesh.

    OMNI defines a protocol for the transmission of IPv6 packets over 
    Overlay Multilink Network Interfaces that are virtual interfaces 
    governing multiple physical network interfaces. 
    OMNI supports multihop V2V communication between vehicles
    in multiple forwarding hops via intermediate vehicles with OMNI links. 
    It also supports multihop V2I communication between a vehicle and an 
    infrastructure access point by multihop V2V communication.
    The OMNI interface supports an NBMA link model where multihop V2V and
    V2I communications use each mobile node's ULAs without need for any DAD
    or MLD messaging.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-6">
    In the OMNI protocol, an OMNI virtual interface can have a ULA
    <xref target="RFC4193" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4193"/> indeed, but wireless physical
    interfaces associated with the OMNI virtual interface can use any prefixes.
    The ULA supports both V2V and V2I multihop forwarding within the
    vehicular network (e.g., via a VANET routing protocol) while each
    vehicle can communicate with Internet correspondents using
    IPv6 global addresses via OMNI interface encapsulation over the wireless
    interface.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.b-7">
    For the control traffic overhead for running both vehicular ND and a VANET 
    routing protocol, the AERO/OMNI approach may avoid this issue by using
    MANET routing protocols only (i.e., no multicast of IPv6 ND messaging) in
    the wireless underlay network while applying efficient unicast IPv6 ND
    messaging in the OMNI overlay on an as-needed basis for router discovery
    and NUD. This greatly reduces the overhead for VANET-wide multicasting
    while providing agile accommodation for dynamic topology changes.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-1">
    The seamless application communication between two vehicles or 
    between a vehicle
    and an infrastructure node requires mobility management 
    in vehicular networks.
    The mobility management schemes include a host-based mobility scheme,
    network-based mobility scheme, and software-defined networking scheme. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-2">	
    In the host-based mobility scheme (e.g., MIPv6), an IP-RSU plays the role
    of a home agent. On the other hand, in the network-based mobility scheme
    (e.g., PMIPv6), an MA plays the role of a mobility management controller,
    such as a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6, which also serves
    vehicles as a home agent, and an IP-RSU plays the role of an access router,
    such as a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) in PMIPv6 <xref target="RFC5213" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5213"/>. 
	  The host-based mobility scheme needs client functionality in the
    IPv6 stack of a vehicle as a mobile node for mobility signaling 
	  message exchange between the vehicle and home agent.
    On the other hand, the network-based mobility scheme does not 
    need such client functionality of a vehicle because the network
    infrastructure node (e.g., MAG in PMIPv6) as a proxy mobility agent 
    handles the mobility signaling message exchange with the home agent
    (e.g., LMA in PMIPv6) for the sake of the vehicle.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-3">
    There are a scalability issue and a route optimization issue in the
    network-based mobility scheme (e.g., PMIPv6) when an MA covers a
    large vehicular network governing many IP-RSUs. In this case, a
    distributed mobility scheme (e.g., DMM <xref target="RFC7429" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7429"/>)
    can mitigate the scalability issue by distributing multiple MAs in
    the vehicular network such that they are positioned closer to
    vehicles for route optimization and bottleneck mitigation in a
    central MA in the network-based mobility scheme.
    All these mobility approaches (i.e., a host-based mobility scheme,
    network-based mobility scheme, and distributed mobility scheme) and
    a hybrid approach of a combination of them need to provide an
    efficient mobility service to vehicles moving fast and moving along
    with relatively predictable trajectories along the roadways.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.c-4">
    In vehicular networks, the control plane can be separated from
    the data plane for efficient mobility management and data forwarding
    by using the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 
    <xref target="RFC7149" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7149"/> <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FPC-DMM"/>. 
    Note that Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FPC-DMM"/>,
	  which is a flexible mobility management system, can manage the
    separation of data plane and control plane in DMM.
	  In SDN, the control plane and data plane are separated for the
    efficient management of forwarding elements (e.g., switches and
    routers) where an SDN controller configures the forwarding elements
    in a centralized way, and they perform packet forwarding according to
    their forwarding tables that are configured by the SDN controller.
    An MA as an SDN controller needs to efficiently configure and
    monitor its IP-RSUs and vehicles for mobility management and security services.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-1">
    The wireless and/or wired-line links in paths between both mobile
    nodes and fixed network correspondents may configure a variety of
    Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs), where all IPv6 links are required
    to support a minimum MTU of 1280 octets and may  support larger MTUs.
    Unfortunately, determining the path MTU (i.e., the minimum link MTU
    in the path) has proven to be inefficient and unreliable due to the
    uncertain nature of the loss-oriented ICMPv6 messaging service used
    for path MTU discovery. Recent developments have produced a more
    reliable path MTU determination service for TCP <xref target="RFC4821" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4821"/> 
    and UDP <xref target="RFC8899" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8899"/>; however, the MTUs discovered are 
    always limited by the most
    restrictive link MTU in the path (often 1500 octets or smaller).
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-2">
    The AERO/OMNI service addresses the MTU issue by introducing a new
    layer in the Internet architecture known as the "OMNI Adaptation Layer
    (OAL)". The OAL allows end systems that configure an OMNI interface
    to utilize a full 65535-octet MTU by leveraging the IPv6 fragmentation
    and reassembly service during encapsulation to produce fragment sizes
    that are assured of traversing the path without loss due to a
    size restriction. Thus, this allows end systems to send packets that are
    often much larger than the actual path MTU.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.d-3"> 
    Performance studies over the course of many decades have proven that
    applications will see greater performance by sending smaller numbers
    of large packets (as opposed to larger numbers of small packets) even
    if fragmentation is needed. The OAL further supports even larger packet
    sizes through the IP Parcels construct 
    <xref target="I-D.templin-intarea-parcels" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PARCELS"/>,
    which provides "packets-in-packet" encapsulation for a total size up
    to 4 MB. Together, the OAL and IP Parcels will provide a revolutionary
    new capability for greater efficiency in both mobile and fixed networks.
    On the other hand, due to the highly dynamic nature of vehicular networks, 
    a high packet loss may not be able to be avoided. The high packet 
    loss on IP Parcels can simultaneously cause multiple TCP sessions 
    to experience packet retransmissions, session time-out, or 
    re-establishment of the sessions. Other protocols, such as MPTCP and 
    QUIC, may also experience similar issues. A mechanism for 
    mitigating this issue in OAL and IP Parcels should be considered.
