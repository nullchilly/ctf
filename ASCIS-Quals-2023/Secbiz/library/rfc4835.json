The Encapsulating\r\nSecurity Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) provide two\r\nmechanisms for protecting data being sent over an IPsec Security\r\nAssociation (SA).  To ensure interoperability between disparate\r\nimplementations, it is necessary to specify a set of\r\nmandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one\r\nalgorithm that all implementations will have available.  This document defines\r\nthe current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH\r\nas well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented because\r\nthey may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.
