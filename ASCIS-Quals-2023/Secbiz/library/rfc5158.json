The mechanism is based on a\r\nconventional DNS delegation service interface, allowing the service\r\nclient to enter the details of a number of DNS servers for the\r\ndelegated domain.  In the context of a 6to4 reverse delegation, the\r\nclient is primarily authenticated by its source address used in the\r\ndelegation request, and is authorized to use the function if its IPv6\r\naddress prefix corresponds to an address from within the requested\r\n6to4 delegation address block.
