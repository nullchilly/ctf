This\r\n\"Generalized SCSI\" can be used with routing protocols that define\r\nGMPLS ISCDs and any specific technology.  This document does not\r\nmodify any existing technology-specific formats and is defined for\r\nuse in conjunction with new GMPLS Switching Capability types.  The\r\ncontext for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the reader is\r\nexpected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture and associated\r\nprotocol standards.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["OSPF-TE","GMPLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8258","errata_url":null}
