The architectural choices for the interaction between IP and optical network layers, specifically, the routing and signaling aspects, are maturing.  At the same time, a consensus has emerged in the industry on utilizing IP-based protocols for the optical control plane.  This document defines a framework for IP over Optical networks, considering both the IP-based control plane for optical networks as well as IP-optical network interactions (together referred to as \"IP over optical networks\").  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
