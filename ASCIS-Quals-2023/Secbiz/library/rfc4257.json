One consideration is to use GMPLS\r\nprotocols to upgrade the control plane of optical transport networks.\r\nThis document illustrates this process by describing those extensions\r\nto GMPLS protocols that are aimed at controlling Synchronous Digital\r\nHierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) networks.\r\nSDH\/SONET networks make good examples of this process for a variety of\r\nreasons.  This document highlights extensions to GMPLS-related routing\r\nprotocols to disseminate information needed in transport path\r\ncomputation and network operations, together with (G)MPLS protocol\r\nextensions required for the provisioning of transport circuits.  New\r\ncapabilities that an GMPLS control plane would bring to SDH\/SONET\r\nnetworks, such as new restoration methods and multi-layer circuit\r\nestablishment, are also discussed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["mpls","optical switching","sdh","sonet"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4257","errata_url":null}
