Servers will only return\r\nfull responses that include all of the information that a client is\r\nauthorized to receive.  A partial response capability that limits the\r\namount of information returned, especially in the case of search\r\nqueries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers.  This\r\ndocument describes an RDAP query extension that allows clients to\r\nspecify their preference for obtaining a partial response.","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":["RDAP","Partial response"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8982","errata_url":null}
