The main goal of this protocol is to allow the\r\nNAS to configure, manage, and control access equipment, including the\r\nability for the Access Nodes to report information to the NAS.\r\n\r\nThis present document investigates security threats that all ANCP\r\nnodes could encounter.  This document develops a threat model for\r\nANCP security, with the aim of deciding which security functions are\r\nrequired.  Based on this, security requirements regarding the Access\r\nNode Control Protocol are defined.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"January 2010","keywords":["ANCP security","ANCP threats","ANCP attacks"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5713","errata_url":null}
