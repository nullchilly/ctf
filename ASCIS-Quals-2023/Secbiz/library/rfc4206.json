A way to create such a hierarchy\r\nis by (a) a Label Switching Router (LSR) creating a Traffic\r\nEngineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP), (b) the LSR forming a\r\nforwarding adjacency (FA) out of that LSP (by advertising this LSP as\r\na Traffic Engineering (TE) link into the same instance of ISIS\/OSPF\r\nas the one that was used to create the LSP), (c) allowing other LSRs\r\nto use FAs for their path computation, and (d) nesting of LSPs\r\noriginated by other LSRs into that LSP (by using the label stack\r\nconstruct).\r\n\r\nThis document describes the mechanisms to accomplish this.
