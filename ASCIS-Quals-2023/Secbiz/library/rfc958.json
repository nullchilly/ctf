{"draft":"","doc_id":"RFC0958","title":" Network Time Protocol (NTP) ","authors":["D.L. Mills"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"14","pub_status":"UNKNOWN","status":"UNKNOWN","source":"Legacy","abstract":"    This document describes the Network Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol for    synchronizing a set of network clocks using a set of distributed clients    and servers.  NTP is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which    provides a connectionless transport mechanism.  It is evolved from the    Time Protocol and the ICMP Timestamp message and is a suitable    replacement for both.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements.
