Venaas"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"16","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"IPv6 Operations","abstract":"When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are\r\nconfigured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey\r\ninformation to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the\r\nnetwork.  This information includes the implied default router\r\naddress taken from the observed source address of the RA message, as\r\nwell as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended\r\nmisconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious\r\nattacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in\r\nturn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In\r\nthis document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be\r\nobserved and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We\r\nfocus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of\r\nthis text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework\r\naround which solutions can be proposed and discussed.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["RA","rogue ra"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6104","errata_url":null}
