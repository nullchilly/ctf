This\r\nopenness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but\r\nit can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by\r\ncertain parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms\r\nto limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable\r\ncommunications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on\r\n\"blocking\" and \"filtering\", the active prevention of such\r\ncommunications.  This document examines several technical approaches\r\nto Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with\r\nthe overall Internet architecture.  When it is possible to do so, the\r\napproach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the\r\nInternet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially\r\nundesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in\r\nabusive or objectionable communications.  We observe that certain\r\nfiltering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences\r\nto third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various\r\napproaches.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":["Firewall","Filter","Deep Packet Inspection","Domain Name Seizure","Web Portal","Web Proxy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7754","errata_url":null}
