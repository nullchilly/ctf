Subsequently, it provides advice\r\non possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the\r\ninteroperability requirements of each identifier category while\r\nminimizing the negative security and privacy implications, thus\r\nproviding guidance to protocol designers and protocol implementers.\r\nFinally, it describes a number of algorithms that have been employed\r\nin real implementations to generate transient numeric identifiers and\r\nanalyzes their security and privacy properties.
