Using\r\nthis approach, producers may publish, share, and exchange\r\nrepresentations of software descriptors, security incidents, attack\r\nindicators, software vulnerabilities, configuration checklists, and\r\nother security automation information as web-addressable resources.\r\nFurthermore, consumers and other stakeholders may access and search\r\nthis security information as needed, establishing a rapid and\r\non-demand information exchange network for restricted internal use or\r\npublic access repositories.  This specification extends the Atom\r\nPublishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format to transport and\r\nshare security automation resource representations.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["syndication","atom","atom publishing protocol","atom syndication format","rest","information sharing","security automation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8322","errata_url":null}
