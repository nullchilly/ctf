A peer outside the realm would have to\r\nperform a Diameter capability exchange with every node until it\r\ndiscovers one that supports the required application.  This document\r\nupdates RFC 3588, \"Diameter Base Protocol\", and describes an\r\nimprovement using an extended format for the Straightforward-Naming\r\nAuthority Pointer (S-NAPTR) application service tag that allows for\r\ndiscovery of the supported applications without doing Diameter\r\ncapability exchange beforehand.
