This feature allows extended attributes (hereinafter also\r\nreferred to as xattrs) to be interrogated and manipulated using NFSv4\r\nclients.  Xattrs are provided by a file system to associate opaque\r\nmetadata, not interpreted by the file system, with files and\r\ndirectories.  Such support is present in many modern local file\r\nsystems.  New file attributes are provided to allow clients to query\r\nthe server for xattr support, with that support consisting of new\r\noperations to get and set xattrs on file system objects.","pub_date":"December 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8276","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8276"}
