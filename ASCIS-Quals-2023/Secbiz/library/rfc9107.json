On route\r\nreflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the\r\nbest route from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the\r\nstandpoint of the route reflectors themselves. Depending on the\r\nscaling and precision requirements, route selection can be specific\r\nfor one client, common for a set of clients, or common for all\r\nclients of a route reflector. This solution is particularly\r\napplicable in deployments using centralized route reflectors, where\r\nchoosing the best route based on the route reflector's IGP location\r\nis suboptimal. This  facilitates, for example, a \"best exit point\"\r\npolicy (\"hot potato routing\").\r\n\r\nThe solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths that\r\nare eligible for consideration. BGP route selection is performed in\r\nthe route reflectors based on the IGP cost from configured locations\r\nin the link-state IGP.","pub_date":"August 2021","keywords":["IDR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9107","errata_url":null}
