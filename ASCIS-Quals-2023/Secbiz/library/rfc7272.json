IDMS is the process\r\nof synchronizing playout across multiple media receivers.  Using the\r\nRTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this document, media playout\r\ninformation from participants in a synchronization group can be\r\ncollected.  Based on the collected information, an RTCP IDMS Settings\r\nPacket can then be sent to distribute a common target playout point\r\nto which all the distributed receivers, sharing a media experience,\r\ncan synchronize.\r\n\r\nTypical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared\r\nservice control (i.e., applications where two or more geographically\r\nseparated users are watching a media stream together), distance\r\nlearning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":["Inter-Destination Media Synchronization","RTP Control Protocol","RTCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7272","errata_url":null}
