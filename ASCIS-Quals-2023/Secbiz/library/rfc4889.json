This results in increased length of packet route and increased\r\npacket delay in most cases.  To overcome these limitations, one might\r\nhave to turn to Route Optimization (RO) for NEMO.  This memo\r\ndocuments various types of Route Optimization in NEMO and explores\r\nthe benefits and tradeoffs in different aspects of NEMO Route\r\nOptimization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["nemo","mrha","mobile router and home agent","ro"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4889","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4889"}
