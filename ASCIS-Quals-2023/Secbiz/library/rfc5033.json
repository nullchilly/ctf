Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion\r\ncontrol schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion\r\ncontrol principles.  Using these new congestion control schemes in\r\nthe global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic\r\nusing the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently\r\nstandardized congestion control.  Therefore, the IETF must proceed\r\nwith caution when dealing with alternate congestion control\r\nproposals.  The goal of this document is to provide guidance for\r\nconsidering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the\r\nInternet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for\r\nimprovements.","pub_date":"August 2007","keywords":["[--------|b]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0133"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5033","errata_url":null}
