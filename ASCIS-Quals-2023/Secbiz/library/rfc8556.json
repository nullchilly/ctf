The P-tunnels are used for carrying\r\nmulticast traffic across the backbone.  A variety of P-tunnel types\r\nare supported.  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new\r\narchitecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a\r\n\"multicast domain\", without requiring intermediate routers to\r\nmaintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building\r\nprotocol.  This document specifies the protocol and procedures that\r\nallow MVPN to use BIER as the method of carrying multicast traffic\r\nover a service provider's backbone network.","pub_date":"April 2019","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8556","errata_url":null}
