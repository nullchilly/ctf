In this case, all\r\nprotocol operations may need to be explicitly authorized and traced,\r\nrequiring the interaction between Mobile IPv6 and the AAA\r\ninfrastructure.  Integrating the Authentication, Authorization, and\r\nAccounting (AAA) infrastructure (e.g., Network Access Server and AAA\r\nserver) also offers a solution component for Mobile IPv6\r\nbootstrapping.  This document describes various scenarios where a AAA\r\ninterface for Mobile IPv6 is required.  Additionally, it lists design\r\ngoals and requirements for such an interface.  This memo provides \r\ninformation for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2009","keywords":["AAA","MIPv6","Mobile IP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5637","errata_url":null}
