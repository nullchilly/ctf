The basic IDN definition allows\r\na very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this\r\nrichness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking\r\nnames.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must\r\nimpose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations.\r\nThis document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to\r\ndefine and implement such rules for a broad range of languages,\r\nincluding adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and\r\nKorean domain names.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"November 2005","keywords":["chinese domain names","japanese domain names","korean domain names"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4290","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4290"}
