While it is common for schemes to further delegate their\r\nsubstructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards\r\nthat mandate particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate,\r\nbecause that essentially usurps ownership.  This document further\r\ndescribes this problematic practice and provides some acceptable\r\nalternatives for use in standards.","pub_date":"July 2014","keywords":["URI structure"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8820"],"updates":["RFC3986"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7320","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7320"}
