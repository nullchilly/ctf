Some DNS recursive resolver\r\noperators want to prevent snooping of requests sent to DNS root\r\nservers by third parties.  Such resolvers can greatly decrease the\r\nround-trip time and prevent observation of requests by running a copy\r\nof the full root zone on a loopback address (such as 127.0.0.1).\r\nThis document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root\r\nzone that does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS, at the\r\ncost of adding some operational fragility for the operator.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8806"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7706","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7706"}
