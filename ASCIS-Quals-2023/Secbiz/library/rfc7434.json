As networks move to SIP, it is\r\nimportant that applications requiring this data can continue to\r\nfunction in SIP networks as well as have the ability to interwork\r\nwith this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency.  This document\r\ndefines a usage (a new package called the ISDN UUI package) of the\r\nUser-to-User header field to enable interworking with this ISDN\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis document covers interworking with both public ISDN and private\r\nISDN capabilities, so the potential interworking with QSIG will also\r\nbe addressed.\r\n\r\nThe package is identified by the new value \"isdn-uui\" of the\r\n\"purpose\" header field parameter.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":["UUS Supplementary Service"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7434","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7434"}
