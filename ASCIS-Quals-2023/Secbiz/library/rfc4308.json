There are many such algorithms available,\r\nand two IPsec systems cannot interoperate unless they are using the\r\nsame algorithms.  This document specifies optional suites of\r\nalgorithms and attributes that can be used to simplify the\r\nadministration of IPsec when used in manual keying mode, with IKEv1 or\r\nwith IKEv2.
