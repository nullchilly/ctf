However, client applications\r\noften need to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF\r\nserver capabilities, that may impact management applications.\r\nStandard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base\r\nsystem events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a\r\nYANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for\r\nsome common system events.
