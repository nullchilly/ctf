OSCORE provides end-to-end protection\r\nbetween endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP.\r\nOSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a\r\nrange of proxy operations, including translation between different\r\ntransport protocols.\r\n\r\nAlthough an optional functionality of CoAP, OSCORE alters CoAP\r\noptions processing and IANA registration.  Therefore, this document\r\nupdates RFC 7252.","pub_date":"July 2019","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7252"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8613","errata_url":null}
