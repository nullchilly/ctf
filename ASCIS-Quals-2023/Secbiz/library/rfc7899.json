The procedures described in\r\nthis document are applicable to BGP-based multicast VPN and help\r\navoid uncontrolled control-plane load increase in the core routing\r\ninfrastructure.  The new procedures proposed were inspired by BGP\r\nunicast route damping principles that have been adapted to multicast.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["dampening","multicast","vpn","damping","bgp","pim"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6514"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7899","errata_url":null}
