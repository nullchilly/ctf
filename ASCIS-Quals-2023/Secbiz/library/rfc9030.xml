            6TiSCH expects a high degree of scalability together with a
            distributed routing functionality based on RPL. To achieve this
            goal, the spectrum must be allocated in a way that allows for
            spatial reuse between zones that will not interfere with one
            another.
            In a large and spatially distributed network, a 6TiSCH node is
            often in a good position to determine usage of the spectrum in its
            vicinity.

          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3.1-2">
            With 6TiSCH, the abstraction of an IPv6 link is implemented as a
            pair of bundles of cells, one in each direction. IP links are only
            enabled between RPL parents and children. The 6TiSCH
            operation is optimal when the size of a bundle minimizes both
            the energy wasted in idle listening and the packet drops due to
            congestion loss, while packets are forwarded within
            an acceptable latency.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3.1-3">
            Use cases for distributed routing are often associated with a
            statistical distribution of best-effort traffic with variable needs
            for bandwidth on each individual link. The 6TiSCH operation can
            remain optimal if RPL parents can adjust, dynamically and with enough 
            reactivity to match the variations of best-effort traffic,
            the amount of bandwidth that is used to communicate between themselves 
            and their children, in both directions.
            In turn, the agility to fulfill the needs for additional cells
            improves when the number of interactions with other devices and
            the protocol latencies are minimized.

            6top is a logical link control sitting between the IP layer and the
            TSCH MAC layer, which provides the link abstraction that is required
            for IP operations. The 6top Protocol, 6P, which is specified in
            <xref target="RFC8480" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8480"/>, is one of the services provided by 6top.
            In particular, the 6top services are available over a management
            API that enables an external management entity to schedule cells
            and slotframes, and allows the addition of complementary
            functionality, for instance, a Scheduling Function

            cells and that can add and remove soft cells in the TSCH schedule to adapt
            to the traffic needs, or move one when it performs poorly.
            To reserve a soft cell, the higher layer does not indicate the exact
            slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting
            bandwidth and QoS requirements. When the monitoring process triggers
            a cell reallocation, the two neighbor devices communicating over this
            cell negotiate its new position in the TSCH schedule.

        placed for transmission in the bundle that is used for Layer 3 traffic
        towards the next hop along the Track.
        The MAC address should be set to the next-hop MAC address to avoid
        confusion.

        It results in a frame that is received over a Layer 3 bundle that may be in
        fact associated with a Track. In a classical IP link such as an Ethernet,
        off-Track traffic is typically in excess over reservation to be routed
        along the non-reserved path based on its QoS setting.
        But with 6TiSCH, since the use of the Layer 3 bundle may be due to
        transmission failures, it makes sense for the receiver to recognize a
        frame that should be re-Tracked and to place it back on the appropriate
        bundle if possible.
        A frame is re-Tracked by scheduling it for transmission over the
        transmit bundle associated with the Track, with the destination MAC
        address set to broadcast.

         By forwarding, this document means the per-packet operation that
         allows delivery of a packet to a next hop or an upper layer in this node.
         Forwarding is based on preexisting state that was installed as a
         result of a routing computation, see <xref target="rtg" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.7"/>.
         6TiSCH supports three different forwarding models: (GMPLS) Track
         Forwarding, (classical) IPv6 Forwarding, and (6LoWPAN) Fragment Forwarding.

            Forwarding along a Track can be seen as a Generalized Multiprotocol
            Label Switching (GMPLS) operation in that the information used to
            switch a frame is not an explicit label but is rather related to other
            properties of the way the packet was received, a particular cell in
            the case of 6TiSCH.
            As a result, as long as the TSCH MAC (and Layer 2 security) accepts
            a frame, that frame can be switched regardless of the protocol,
            whether this is an IPv6 packet, a 6LoWPAN fragment, or a frame from
            an alternate protocol such as WirelessHART or ISA100.11a.

            A data frame that is forwarded along a Track normally has a
            destination MAC address that is set to broadcast or a multicast
            address depending on MAC support.
            This way, the MAC layer in the intermediate nodes accepts the
            incoming frame and 6top switches it without incurring a change in
            the MAC header.
            In the case of IEEE Std 802.15.4, this means effectively to
            broadcast, so that along the Track the short address for the
            destination of the frame is set to 0xFFFF.

            fragments are then switched based on that stored state.

   6TiSCH supports the PREOF operations of elimination and reordering of packets
   along a complex Track, but has no requirement about tagging a sequence number
   in the packet for that purpose.
   With 6TiSCH, the schedule can tell when multiple receive timeslots correspond
   to copies of a same packet, in which case the receiver may avoid listening to
   the extra copies once it has received one instance of the packet.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7.2-2">
   The semantics of the configuration enable correlated timeslots to be
   grouped for transmit (and receive, respectively) with 'OR' relations,
   and then an 'AND' relation can be configurable between groups.
   The semantics are such that if the transmit (and receive, respectively) operation
   succeeded in one timeslot in an 'OR' group, then all the other timeslots in
   the group are ignored.
   Now, if there are at least two groups, the 'AND' relation between the groups
   indicates that one operation must succeed in each of the groups.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7.2-3">
   On the transmit side, timeslots provisioned for retries along a same branch
   of a Track are placed in the same 'OR' group. The 'OR' relation indicates that if
   a transmission is acknowledged, then retransmissions of that packet should
   not be attempted for the remaining timeslots in that group. There are as many
   'OR' groups as there are branches of the Track departing from this node.
   Different 'OR' groups are programmed for the purpose of replication, each
   group corresponding to one branch of the Track. The 'AND' relation between the
   groups indicates that transmission over any of branches must be attempted
   regardless of whether a transmission succeeded in another branch. It is also
   possible to place cells to different next-hop routers in the same 'OR' group.
   This allows routing along multipath Tracks, trying one next hop and then
   another only if sending to the first fails.
          </t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7.2-4">
   On the receive side, all timeslots are programmed in the same 'OR' group.
   Retries of the same copy as well as converging branches for elimination
   are converged, meaning that the first successful reception is enough and that
   all the other timeslots can be ignored. An 'AND' group denotes different
   packets that must all be received and transmitted over the associated
   transmit groups within their respected 'AND' or 'OR' rules.

    If the receiver and the sender have a different sense of ASN, the MIC will
    not validate and the frame will be dropped. In that sense, TSCH induces an
    event horizon whereby only nodes that have a common sense of ASN can talk to
    one another in an authenticated manner. With 6TiSCH, the pledge discovers a
    tentative ASN in beacons from nodes that have already joined the network.
    But even if the beacon can be authenticated, the ASN cannot be trusted as it
    could be a replay by an attacker, announcing an ASN that
    represents a time in the  past. If the pledge uses an ASN that is learned

    After obtaining the tentative ASN, a pledge that wishes to join the
    6TiSCH network must use a join protocol to obtain its security keys.
    The join protocol used in 6TiSCH is the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP).
    In the minimal setting defined in
    <xref target="RFC9031" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9031"/>, the authentication
    requires a pre-shared key, based on which a secure session is derived.
    The CoJP exchange may also be preceded by a zero-touch handshake
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ZEROTOUCH-JOIN"/> in order
    to enable pledge joining based on certificates and/or inter-domain

    As detailed in <xref target="rflo" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2.1"/>,
    a Join Proxy (JP) helps the pledge with the join procedure by relaying the
    link-scope Join Request over the IP network to a Join Registrar/Coordinator
    (JRC) that can authenticate the pledge and validate that it is attached to
    the appropriate network. As a result of the CoJP exchange, the pledge is in
    possession of link-layer material including keys and a short address, and
    if the ASN is known to be correct, all traffic can now be secured using CCM*
    <xref target="CCMstar" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CCMstar"/> at the link layer.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.5-3">
    The authentication steps must be such that they cannot be replayed by an
    attacker, and they must not depend on the tentative ASN being valid.
    During the authentication, the keying material that the pledge obtains from
    the JRC does not provide protection against spoofed ASN. Once the pledge has
    obtained the keys to use in the network, it may still need to verify the ASN.
    If the nonce used in the Layer 2 security derives from the extended (MAC-64)
    address, then replaying the ASN alone cannot enable a nonce-reuse attack
    unless the same node has lost its state with a previous ASN. But
    if the nonce derives from the short address (e.g., assigned by the JRC), then
    the JRC must ensure that it never assigns short addresses that were already
    given to this or other nodes with the same keys. In other words, the network
    must be rekeyed before the JRC runs out of short addresses.

      a mechanism to change (rekey) the network.
      There are a number of reasons to initiate a network rekey: to remove
      unwanted (corrupt/malicious) nodes, to recover unused 2-byte short
      addresses, or due to limits in encryption algorithms.
      For all of the mechanisms that distribute a network-wide key, rekeying
      is also needed on a periodic basis. In more detail:

      advance communication between the JRC and every one of the nodes before
      the key change.  Given that many nodes may be sleepy, this operation
      may take a significant amount of time and may consume a significant
      portion of the available bandwidth.  As such, network-wide rekeys
      to exclude nodes that have become malicious will not be
      particularly quick.  If a rekey is already in progress, but the
      unwanted node has not yet been updated, then it is possible to just
      continue the operation.  If the unwanted node has already received the
      update, then the rekey operation will need to be restarted.

      The cryptographic mechanisms used by IEEE Std 802.15.4 include the 2-byte
      short address in the calculation of the context.
      A nonce-reuse attack may become feasible if a short address is reassigned
      to another node while the  same network-wide keys are in operation.
      A network that gains and loses nodes on a regular
      basis is likely to reach the 65536 limit of the 2-byte (16-bit) short
      addresses, even if the network has only a few thousand nodes. Network
      planners should consider the need to rekey the network on a periodic
      basis in order to recover 2-byte addresses.  The rekey can update the
      short addresses for active nodes if desired, but there is actually no
      need to do this as long as the key has been changed.

      With TSCH as it stands at the time of this writing, the ASN will wrap
      after 2^40 timeslot durations, meaning around 350 years with the default values. 
     Wrapping ASN is not expected to happen within the lifetime of
      most LLNs. Yet, should the ASN wrap, the network must be rekeyed to avoid
      a nonce-reuse attack.
    </li>
          <li pn="section-6.6-5.4">
      Many cipher algorithms have some suggested limits on how many bytes
      should be encrypted with that algorithm before a new key is used.
      These numbers are typically in the many to hundreds of gigabytes of
      data.  On very fast backbone networks, this becomes an important
      concern. On LLNs with typical data rates in the kilobits/second,
      this concern is significantly less. With IEEE Std 802.15.4 as it stands
      at the time of this writing, the ASN will wrap before the limits of the
      current L2 crypto (AES-CCM-128) are reached, so the problem should never
      occur.
    </li>
          <li pn="section-6.6-5.5">
      In any fashion, if the LLN is expected to operate continuously for decades,

      Except for urgent rekeys caused by malicious nodes, the rekey operation
      described in <xref target="RFC9031" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9031"/>
      can be done as a background task and can be done incrementally.  It
      is a make-before-break mechanism.  The switch over to the new key is
      not signaled by time, but rather by observation that the new key is in
      use.  As such, the update can take as long as needed, or occur in as
      short a time as practical.

LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point).  This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported.  Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory-constrained routers.

              <t indent="0">The IETF work in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) defines 6LoWPANs such as IEEE 802.15.4.  This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation.  In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow the traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non- transitive wireless links, as its reliance on the traditional IPv6 link concept and its heavy use of multicast make it inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low-power and lossy network.  This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, its addressing mechanisms, and duplicate address detection for Low- power Wireless Personal Area Networks and similar networks.  The document thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.  These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.  The term "Traffic Engineered network" refers to a network that uses any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity.</t>

A 6top SF decides when to add/delete cells, and it triggers 6P Transactions.  The definition of SFs is out of scope for this document; however, this document provides the requirements for an SF.</t>

Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>

The new extension is called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.</t>

              <t indent="0">   Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Point-to-Point (P2P)
   traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (LLNs).  For that purpose, this document specifies a reactive P2P
   route discovery mechanism for both hop-by-hop routing and source
   routing: Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) based RPL
   protocol (AODV-RPL).  Paired Instances are used to construct
   directional paths, in case some of the links between source and
   target node are asymmetric.

              <t indent="0">   This document extends RFC 6550 and RFC 6553 to enable a RPL Root to
   install and maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a
   selected set of nodes that may or may not include self, for a chosen
   duration.  This potentially enables routes that are more optimized or
   resilient than those obtained with the classical distributed
   operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing Header or
   in terms of path length, which impacts both the latency and the
   packet delivery ratio.

              <t indent="0">   This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), a
   very compact, and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange with ephemeral keys.  EDHOC provides mutual authentication,
   perfect forward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended
   for usage in constrained scenarios and a main use case is to
   establish an OSCORE security context.  By reusing COSE for
   cryptography, CBOR for encoding, and CoAP for transport, the
   additional code footprint can be kept very low.

              <t indent="0">This document describes the modifications to OSPF to support version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6).  The fundamental mechanisms of OSPF (flooding, Designated Router (DR) election, area support, Short Path First (SPF) calculations, etc.) remain unchanged.  However, some changes have been necessary, either due to changes in protocol semantics between IPv4 and IPv6, or simply to handle the increased address size of IPv6.  These modifications will necessitate incrementing the protocol version from version 2 to version 3.  OSPF for IPv6 is also referred to as OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3).</t>
              <t indent="0">Changes between OSPF for IPv4, OSPF Version 2, and OSPF for IPv6 as described herein include the following.  Addressing semantics have been removed from OSPF packets and the basic Link State Advertisements (LSAs).  New LSAs have been created to carry IPv6 addresses and prefixes.  OSPF now runs on a per-link basis rather than on a per-IP-subnet basis.  Flooding scope for LSAs has been generalized.  Authentication has been removed from the OSPF protocol and instead relies on IPv6's Authentication Header and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).</t>
              <t indent="0">Even with larger IPv6 addresses, most packets in OSPF for IPv6 are almost as compact as those in OSPF for IPv4.  Most fields and packet- size limitations present in OSPF for IPv4 have been relaxed.  In addition, option handling has been made more flexible.</t>

Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet.  While situated away from its home, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node's current location.  IPv6 packets addressed to a mobile node's home address are transparently routed to its care-of address.  The protocol enables IPv6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile node's home address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address.  To support this operation, Mobile IPv6 defines a new IPv6 protocol and a new destination option.  All IPv6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) are formed by devices that are compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.  However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification defines how mesh topologies could be obtained and maintained.  Thus, it should be considered how 6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing could be supported.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document provides the problem statement and design space for 6LoWPAN routing.  It defines the routing requirements for 6LoWPANs, considering the low-power and other particular characteristics of the devices and links.  The purpose of this document is not to recommend specific solutions but to provide general, layer-agnostic guidelines about the design of 6LoWPAN routing that can lead to further analysis and protocol design.  This document is intended as input to groups working on routing protocols relevant to 6LoWPANs, such as the IETF ROLL WG.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;  it is published for informational purposes.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document describes a network-layer-based protocol that enables separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure.  The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) can be incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers Traffic Engineering, multihoming, and mobility benefits to early adopters, even when there are relatively few LISP-capable sites.</t>
              <t indent="0">Design and development of LISP was largely motivated by the problem statement produced by the October 2006 IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open interfaces.  SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.  This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what the layer structure is in an SDN architecture, and how layers interface with each other.  This document, a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise reference for the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations.</t>

"Deterministic" in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.</t>

We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t>

              <t indent="0">   When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be
   beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in
   its entirety before forwarding it.

   This has been always possible with the original fragmentation design
   of RFC 4944.  Apart from a brief mention of the way to do this in
   Section 2.5.2 of the 6LoWPAN book, this has not been extensively
   described in the literature.  The present document attempts to fill
   that gap.

   enroll a new device (the "pledge") into a IEEE802.15.4 TSCH network
   using the 6tisch signaling mechanisms.  The resulting device will
   obtain a domain specific credential that can be used with either
   802.15.9 per-host pair keying protocols, or to obtain the network-

      The current charter positions 6TiSCH on IEEE Std 802.15.4 only.
      Though most of the design should be portable to other link types,
      6TiSCH has a strong dependency on IEEE Std 802.15.4 and its evolution.
      The impact of changes to TSCH on this architecture should be minimal to
      nonexistent, but deeper work such as 6top and security may be impacted.
      A 6TiSCH Interest Group at the IEEE maintains the synchronization
      and helps foster work at the IEEE should 6TiSCH demand it.
