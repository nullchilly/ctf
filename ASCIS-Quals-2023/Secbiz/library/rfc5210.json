In an effort to enhance the Internet with\r\nIP source address validation, a prototype implementation of the IP\r\nSource Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) was created and an\r\nevaluation was conducted on an IPv6 network.  This document reports\r\non the prototype implementation and the test results, as well as the\r\nlessons and insights gained from experimentation.  This memo defines an \r\nExperimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2008","keywords":["[--------]","Source Address Validation","Source Addressing Spoofing","Network Security","Testbed","IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5210","errata_url":null}
