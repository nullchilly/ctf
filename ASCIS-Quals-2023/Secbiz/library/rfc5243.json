In this optimization,\r\na router does not list a Link State Advertisement (LSA) in Database\r\nDescription packets sent to a neighbor, if the same or a more recent\r\ninstance of the LSA was listed in a Database Description packet\r\nalready received from the neighbor.  This optimization reduces\r\nDatabase Description overhead by about 50% in large networks.  This\r\noptimization does not affect synchronization, since it only omits\r\nunnecessary information from Database Description packets.  This memo \r\nprovides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2008","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9454"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5243","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5243"}
