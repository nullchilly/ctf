The\r\naforementioned results serve as a problem statement that is expected\r\nto trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets\r\ncarrying IPv6 EHs so that the situation improves over time.  This\r\ndocument also explains how the results were obtained, such that the\r\ncorresponding measurements can be reproduced by other members of the\r\ncommunity and repeated over time to observe changes in the handling\r\nof packets with IPv6 EHs.","pub_date":"June 2016","keywords":["packet drops"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7872","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7872"}
