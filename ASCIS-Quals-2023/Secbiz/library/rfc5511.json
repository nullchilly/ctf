However, there is no formal definition of this\r\nversion of BNF.\r\n\r\nThere is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of\r\nprotocols that are commonly used together.  This reduces confusion and\r\nsimplifies implementation.\r\n\r\nUpdating existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is\r\nalready formally documented would be a substantial piece of work.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a formal definition of the variant of BNF that\r\nhas been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes it available\r\nfor use by new protocols.
