<a href="./rfc779">RFC 779</a>                                                       April 1981
TELNET SEND-LOCATION Option



<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Motivation for the option.</span>

   Many network sites now provide a listing of the users currently
   logged in giving their names and locations (see the NAME/FINGER
   protocol, <a href="./rfc742">RFC 742</a>).  The location is useful for physically locating
   the user if he or she is nearby, or for calling them (a nearby phone
   number is often included). However, for users logged in via the
   network, the location printed is often no more than the originating
   site name. This TELNET option allows the user's TELNET program to
   send the user's location to the server TELNET so that it can be
   displayed in addition to the site name.  This functionality is
   already present in the SUPDUP protocol (<a href="./rfc734">RFC 734</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Description of the option.</span>

   When the user TELNET program knows the user's location, it should
   offer to transmit this information to the server TELNET by sending
   IAC WILL SEND-LOCATION.  If the server's system is able to make use
   of this information (as can the ITS sites), then the server will
   reply with IAC DO SEND-LOCATION.  The user TELNET is then free to
   send the location in a subnegotiation at any time.
