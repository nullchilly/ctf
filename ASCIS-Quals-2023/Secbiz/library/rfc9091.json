This document describes an extension to DMARC to\r\nfully enable DMARC functionality for PSDs.\r\n\r\nSome implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for\r\nDMARC enforcement.  This specification addresses that case.","pub_date":"July 2021","keywords":["DMARC","email authentication","TLD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9091","errata_url":null}
