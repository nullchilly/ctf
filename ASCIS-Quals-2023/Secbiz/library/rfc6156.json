IPv6 support in TURN includes IPv4-to-IPv6, IPv6-to-IPv6,\r\nand IPv6-to-IPv4 relaying.  This document defines the REQUESTED-\r\nADDRESS-FAMILY attribute for TURN.  The REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY\r\nattribute allows a client to explicitly request the address type the\r\nTURN server will allocate (e.g., an IPv4-only node may request the\r\nTURN server to allocate an IPv6 address).
