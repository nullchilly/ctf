This document describes two techniques for routing\r\nvoice messages based on a telephone number.  The complete service\r\nuses the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) Directory service to\r\nlookup a VPIM email address with a telephone number and confirm that\r\nthe address is both valid and associated with the intended recipient.\r\nHowever, this service will take time to become widely deployed in the near\r\nterm.  This document also describes a basic send-and-pray service that\r\nroutes and delivers messages using only the ENUM\r\ntelephone number resolution service and the existing DNS mail\r\nrouting facilities.
