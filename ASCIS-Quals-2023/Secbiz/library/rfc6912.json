This is especially true of zones\r\nthat accept registrations across organizational boundaries, such as\r\ntop-level domains and, most importantly, the root.  It is\r\nunfortunately not possible to generate algorithms to determine\r\nwhether permitting a code point presents a low risk.  This memo\r\npresents a set of principles that can be used to guide the decision\r\nof whether a Unicode code point may be wisely included in the\r\nrepertoire of permissible code points in a U-label in a zone.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6912","errata_url":null}
