It describes the\r\nmotivation, the measurement approach, and the tools and data formats\r\nneeded to carry out such a study.\r\n\r\nThis document was produced within the IRTF's Network Management\r\nResearch Group (NMRG), and it represents the consensus of all of the\r\nactive contributors to this group.  This memo provides information for \r\nthe Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2008","keywords":["large-scale snmp","irtf","nmrg","network management research group"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5345","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5345"}
