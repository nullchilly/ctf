Consequently, fax calls can be routed to SIP user agents\r\nthat are not fax capable.  A \"fax\" media feature tag implemented in\r\nconjunction with caller preferences allows for more accurate fax call\r\nrouting.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":["media feature tag"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6913","errata_url":null}
