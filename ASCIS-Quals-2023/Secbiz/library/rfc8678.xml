      <t pn="section-abstract-1">Connecting an enterprise site to multiple ISPs over IPv6 using
      provider-assigned addresses is difficult without the use of some form of
      Network Address Translation (NAT). Much has been written on this topic
      over the last 10 to 15 years, but it still remains a problem without a
      clearly defined or widely implemented solution. Any multihoming solution
      without NAT requires hosts at the site to have addresses from each ISP
      and to select the egress ISP by selecting a source address for outgoing
      packets. It also requires routers at the site to take into account those
      source addresses when forwarding packets out towards the ISPs.</t>
      <t pn="section-abstract-2">This document examines currently available mechanisms for providing a solution
to this problem for a broad range of enterprise topologies.
      It covers the behavior of routers to forward traffic by taking into account
      source address, and it covers the behavior of hosts to select appropriate
      default source addresses. It also covers any possible role that routers might
      play in providing information to hosts to help them select appropriate
      source addresses. In the process of exploring potential solutions, this
      document also makes explicit requirements for how the solution would be
      expected to behave from the perspective of an enterprise site network
      administrator.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-introduction">Introduction</name>
      <t pn="section-1-1">Site multihoming, the connection of a subscriber network to multiple
      upstream networks using redundant uplinks, is a common enterprise
      architecture for improving the reliability of its Internet connectivity.
      If the site uses provider-independent (PI) addresses, all traffic
      originating from the enterprise can use source addresses from the PI
      address space. Site multihoming with PI addresses is commonly used with
      both IPv4 and IPv6, and does not present any new technical
      challenges.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">It may be desirable for an enterprise site to connect to multiple
      ISPs using provider-assigned (PA) addresses instead of PI addresses.
      Multihoming with provider-assigned addresses is typically less expensive
      for the enterprise relative to using provider-independent addresses as it does not
      require obtaining and maintaining PI address space nor does it require 
      running BGP between the enterprise and the ISPs (for small/medium networks, 
      running BGP might be not only  undesirable but also impossible, especially if 
      residential-type ISP connections are used).
      PA multihoming is also a practice that should be facilitated and encouraged
      because it does not add to the size of the Internet routing table,
      whereas PI multihoming does. Note that PA is also used to mean
      "provider-aggregatable". In this document, we assume that
      provider-assigned addresses are always provider-aggregatable.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">With PA multihoming, for each ISP connection, the site is assigned a
      prefix from within an address block allocated to that ISP by its
      National or Regional Internet Registry. In the simple case of two ISPs
      (ISP-A and ISP-B), the site will have two different prefixes assigned to
      it (prefix-A and prefix-B). This arrangement is problematic. First,
      packets with the "wrong" source address may be dropped by one of the
      ISPs. In order to limit denial-of-service attacks using spoofed source
      addresses, <xref target="RFC2827" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BCP38"/> recommends that ISPs
      filter traffic from customer sites to allow only traffic with a source
      address that has been assigned by that ISP. So a packet sent from a
      multihomed site on the uplink to ISP-B with a source address in prefix-A
      may be dropped by ISP-B.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">However, even if ISP-B does not implement BCP 38, or ISP-B adds
      prefix-A to its list of allowed source addresses on the uplink from the
      multihomed site, two-way communication may still fail. If the packet
      with a source address in prefix-A was sent to ISP-B because the uplink to
      ISP-A failed, then if ISP-B does not drop the packet, and the packet
      reaches its destination somewhere on the Internet, the return packet
      will be sent back with a destination address in prefix-A. The return
      packet will be routed over the Internet to ISP-A, but it will not be
      delivered to the multihomed site because the site uplink with ISP-A has failed.
      Two-way communication would require some arrangement for ISP-B to
      advertise prefix-A when the uplink to ISP-A fails.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">Note that the same may be true of a provider that does not
      implement BCP 38, even if his upstream provider does, or of a provider 
      that has no corresponding route to deliver the ingress traffic 
      to the multihomed site. The issue is not that the immediate provider implements ingress
      filtering; it is that someone upstream does (so egress traffic is blocked) or lacks a route (causing blackholing of the ingress traffic).</t>
      <t pn="section-1-6">
      Another issue with asymmetric traffic flow (when the egress traffic 
      leaves the site via one ISP, but the return traffic enters the site 
      via another uplink) is related to stateful firewalls/middleboxes. 
      Keeping state in that case might be problematic, even impossible.
</t>
      <t pn="section-1-7">With IPv4, this problem is commonly solved by using private address 
      space described in <xref target="RFC1918" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1918"/> within the multihomed site and
      Network Address Translation (NAT) or Network Address/Port Translation
      (NAPT) <xref target="RFC2663" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2663"/> on the uplinks to the ISPs. However, one of the goals of IPv6 is
      to eliminate the need for and the use of NAT or NAPT. Therefore,
      requiring the use of NAT or NAPT for an enterprise site to multihome
      with provider-assigned addresses is not an attractive solution.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-8"><xref target="RFC6296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6296"/> describes a translation solution
      specifically tailored to meet the requirements of multihoming with
      provider-assigned IPv6 addresses. With the IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
      Translation (NPTv6) solution, an enterprise can use either
      Unique Local Addresses <xref target="RFC4193" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4193"/> or the prefix assigned
      by one of the ISPs within its site. As traffic leaves the site on an uplink to an ISP,
      the source address is translated in a predictable and reversible manner 
      to an address within the prefix assigned by the ISP on that uplink.
      <xref target="RFC6296" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6296"/> is currently classified as
      Experimental, and it has been implemented by several vendors. 
      See <xref target="sec_nptv6" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 8.2"/> for more discussion of NPTv6.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-9">This document defines routing requirements for enterprise multihoming.
      This document focuses on the following general class of
      solutions.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-10">Each host at the enterprise has multiple addresses, at least one from
      each ISP-assigned prefix. As discussed in <xref target="sec_host_address_selection_algo" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.1"/> 
      and in <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/>, each host
      is responsible for choosing the source address that is applied to each packet it
      sends. A host is expected to be able to respond dynamically to the failure of an
      uplink to a given ISP by no longer sending packets with the source
      address corresponding to that ISP. Potential mechanisms for 
      communicating network changes to the host are Neighbor
      Discovery Router Advertisements <xref target="RFC4861" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4861"/>, DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8415"/>, and ICMPv6 <xref target="RFC4443" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4443"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-11">The routers in the enterprise network are responsible for ensuring
      that packets are delivered to the "correct" ISP uplink based on source
      address. This requires that at least some routers in the site network
      are able to take into account the source address of a packet when
      deciding how to route it. That is, some routers must be capable of some
      form of Source Address Dependent Routing (SADR), if only as described in
      <xref target="RFC3704" sectionFormat="of" section="4.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3704#section-4.3" derivedContent="RFC3704"/>. At a minimum, the routers connected to the ISP
      uplinks (the site exit routers or SERs) must be capable of Source
      Address Dependent Routing. Expanding the connected domain of routers
      capable of SADR from the site exit routers deeper into the site network
      will generally result in more efficient routing of traffic with external
      destinations.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-12">This document is organized as follows. <xref target="sec_enterprise_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/> looks in more detail at the 
		enterprise networking environments in which this solution is expected to 
		operate. The discussion of <xref target="sec_enterprise_req" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/> uses the concepts of 
		Source-Prefix-Scoped Routing advertisements and forwarding tables 
		and describes how 
		Source-Prefix-Scoped Routing advertisements are used to generate 
		source-prefix-scoped forwarding tables. A detailed 
		description of generating source-prefix-scoped forwarding tables is provided in 
                <xref target="sec_method" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>. <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/> 
		discusses existing and proposed mechanisms for hosts to
		select the default source address to be used by applications.
		It also discusses the requirements for routing that are needed to
		support these enterprise network scenarios and the mechanisms by
		which hosts are expected to update default source addresses based
		on network state.
		<xref target="sec_deployment" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/> discusses deployment considerations, while <xref target="sec_other_solutions" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 8"/> discusses other solutions.</t>

        <t pn="section-4.1-3">We refer to a router that connects the site to an ISP as a site
        edge router (SER). Several other routers provide connectivity among the
        internal hosts (H31, H32, and H41), as well as connect the internal
        hosts to the Internet through SERa and SERb. In this example, SERa and
        SERb share a direct connection to each other. 
        In <xref target="sec_simple_not_dir_conn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2"/>, we consider a scenario in which this
        is not the case.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.1-4">For the moment, we assume that the hosts are able to select 
        suitable source addresses through some mechanism that
        doesn't involve the routers in the site network. Here, we focus on
        the primary task of the routed site network, which is to get packets
        efficiently to their destinations, while sending a packet to the ISP
        that assigned the prefix that matches the source address of the
        packet. In <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>, we examine what role
        the routed network may play in helping hosts select suitable
        source addresses for packets.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.1-5">With this solution, routers will need some form of Source Address
        Dependent Routing, which will be new functionality. It would be useful
        if an enterprise site does not need to upgrade all routers to support
        the new SADR functionality in order to support PA multihoming. We
        consider whether this is possible and examine the trade-offs of not having
        all routers in the site support SADR functionality.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.1-6">In the topology in <xref target="fig_simple_scenario" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>, it is
        possible to support PA multihoming with only SERa and SERb being
        capable of SADR. The other routers can continue to forward based only
        on destination address, and exchange routes that only consider
        destination address. In this scenario, SERa and SERb communicate
        source-scoped routing information across their shared connection. When
        SERa receives a packet with a source address matching prefix
        2001:db8:0:b000::/52, it forwards the packet to SERb, which forwards
        it on the uplink to ISP-B. The analogous behavior holds for traffic
        that SERb receives with a source address matching prefix
        2001:db8:0:a000::/52.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.1-7">In <xref target="fig_simple_scenario" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>, when only SERa and SERb
        are capable of source address dependent routing, PA multihoming will
        work. However, the paths over which the packets are sent will
        generally not be the shortest paths. The forwarding paths will
        generally be more efficient when more routers are capable of SADR. For
        example, if R4, R2, and R6 are upgraded to support SADR, then they can
        exchange source-scoped routes with SERa and SERb. They will then know
        to send traffic with a source address matching prefix
        2001:db8:0:b000::/52 directly to SERb, without sending it to SERa
        first.</t>

        basic principle that the minimum requirement for the routed site
        network to support PA multihoming is having all of the site exit
        routers be part of a connected SADR domain. Extending the connected

        <name slugifiedName="name-enterprise-network-operator">Enterprise Network Operator Expectations</name>
        <t pn="section-4.3-1">Before considering a more complex scenario, let's look in more
        detail at the reasonably simple multihoming scenario in <xref target="fig_simple_not_dir_conn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/> to understand what can reasonably
        be expected from this solution. As a general guiding principle, we
        assume an enterprise network operator will expect a multihomed network
        to behave as close to a single-homed network as possible. So a
        solution that meets those expectations where possible is a good
        thing.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-2">For traffic between internal hosts and for traffic from outside the
        site to internal hosts, an enterprise network operator would expect
        there to be no visible change in the path taken by this traffic, since
        this traffic does not need to be routed in a way that depends on
        source address. It is also reasonable to expect that internal hosts
        should be able to communicate with each other using either of their
        source addresses without restriction. For example, H31 should be able
        to communicate with H41 using a packet with S=2001:db8:0:a010::31,
        D=2001:db8:0:b020::41, regardless of the state of uplink to ISP-B.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-3">These goals can be accomplished by having all of the routers in the
        network continue to originate normal unscoped destination routes for
        their connected networks. If we can arrange it so that these unscoped
	destination routes are used for forwarding this traffic, then we will
	have accomplished multihoming's goal of not affecting the forwarding
	of traffic destined for internal hosts.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-4">For traffic destined for external hosts, it is reasonable to expect
        that traffic with a source address from the prefix assigned by ISP-A
        to follow the path that the traffic would follow if there were no
        connection to ISP-B. This can be accomplished by having SERa originate
        a source-scoped route of the form (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52, D=::/0).
        If all of the routers in the site support SADR, then the path of
        traffic exiting via ISP-A can match that expectation. If some routers
        don't support SADR, then it is reasonable to expect that the path for
        traffic exiting via ISP-A may be different within the site. This is a
        trade-off that the enterprise network operator may decide to make.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-5">It is important to understand the behavior of this multihoming solution 
        when an uplink to one of the ISPs fails. To simplify this discussion,
        we assume that all routers in the site support SADR. We start by
        looking at the operation of the network when the uplinks to both ISP-A and
        ISP-B are functioning properly. SERa originates a source-scoped route
        of the form (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52, D=::/0), and SERb originates a
        source-scoped route of the form (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52, D=::/0).
        These routes are distributed through the routers in the site, and they
        establish within the routers two sets of forwarding paths for traffic
        leaving the site. One set of forwarding paths is for packets with
        source addresses in 2001:db8:0:a000::/52. The other set of forwarding
        paths is for packets with source addresses in 2001:db8:0:b000::/52. The
        normal destination routes, which are not scoped to these two source
        prefixes, play no role in the forwarding. Whether a packet exits the
        site via SERa or via SERb is completely determined by the source
        address applied to the packet by the host. So for example, when host
        H31 sends a packet to host H101 with (S=2001:db8:0:a010::31,
        D=2001:db8:0:1234::101), the packet will only be sent out the link
        from SERa to ISP-A.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-6">Now consider what happens when the uplink from SERa to ISP-A fails.
        The only way for the packets from H31 to reach H101 is for H31 to
        start using the source address for ISP-B. H31 needs to send the
        following packet: (S=2001:db8:0:b010::31, D=2001:db8:0:1234::101).</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-7">This behavior is very different from the behavior that occurs with
        site multihoming using PI addresses or with PA addresses using NAT. In
        these other multihoming solutions, hosts do not need to react to
        network failures several hops away in order to regain Internet access.
        Instead, a host can be largely unaware of the failure of an uplink to
        an ISP. When multihoming with PA addresses and NAT, existing sessions
        generally need to be reestablished after a failure since the external
        host will receive packets from the internal host with a new source
        address. However, new sessions can be established without any action
        on the part of the hosts.  Multihoming with PA addresses and NAT has created
		the expectation of a fairly quick and simple recovery from network failures.
		Alternatives should to be evaluated in terms of the speed and complexity 
		of the recovery mechanism.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-8">Another significant difference between this multihoming solution
        and multihoming with either PI addresses or with
        PA addresses using NAT is the ability of the enterprise network
        operator to route traffic over different ISPs based on destination
        address. We still consider the fairly simple network of 
        <xref target="fig_simple_not_dir_conn" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 2"/> and assume that uplinks to both
        ISPs are functioning. Assume that the site is multihomed using PA
        addresses and NAT, and that SERa and SERb each originate a normal
        destination route for D=::/0, with the route origination dependent on
        the state of the uplink to the respective ISP.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-9">Now suppose it is observed that an important application running
        between internal hosts and external host H101 experiences much better
        performance when the traffic passes through ISP-A (perhaps because
        ISP-A provides lower latency to H101). When multihoming this site with
        PI addresses or with PA addresses and NAT, the enterprise network
        operator can configure SERa to originate into the site network a
        normal destination route for D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64 (the destination
        prefix to reach H101) that depends on the state of the uplink to
        ISP-A. When the link to ISP-A is functioning, the destination route
        D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64 will be originated by SERa, so traffic from all
        hosts will use ISP-A to reach H101 based on the longest destination
        prefix match in the route lookup.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.3-10">Implementing the same routing policy is more difficult with the PA
        multihoming solution described in this document since it doesn't use
        NAT. By design, the only way to control where a packet exits this
        network is by setting the source address of the packet. Since the
        network cannot modify the source address without NAT, the host must
        set it. To implement this routing policy, each host needs to use the
        source address from the prefix assigned by ISP-A to send traffic
        destined for H101. Mechanisms have been proposed to allow hosts to
        choose the source address for packets in a fine-grained manner. We
        will discuss these proposals in <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>.
        However, an enterprise network administrator would not expect to 
        interact with host operating systems to ensure that a particular 
        source address is chosen for a particular
        destination prefix in order to implement this routing policy.</t>

        multihoming scenario in which the site is connected to two ISPs offering
        only Internet connectivity. It is likely that many actual enterprise
        multihoming scenarios will be similar to this simple example. However,
        there are more complex multihoming scenarios that we would like this
        solution to address as well.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.4-2">It is fairly common for an ISP to offer a service in addition to
        Internet access over the same uplink. Two variations of this are
        reflected in <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/>. In addition to Internet
        access, ISP-A offers a service that requires the site to access host
        H51 at 2001:db8:0:5555::51. The site has a single physical and logical
        connection with ISP-A, and ISP-A only allows access to H51 over that
        connection. So when H32 needs to access the service at H51, it needs to
        send packets with (S=2001:db8:0:a010::32, D=2001:db8:0:5555::51), and
        those packets need to be forwarded out the link from SERa to ISP-A.</t>

        <t pn="section-4.4-4">ISP-B illustrates a variation on this scenario. In addition to
        Internet access, ISP-B also offers a service that requires the site
        to access host H61. The site has two connections to two different
        parts of ISP-B (shown as SERb1 and SERb2 in 
        <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/>). ISP-B expects Internet traffic to use the
        uplink from SERb1, while it expects traffic destined for
        the service at H61 to use the uplink from SERb2. For either uplink,
        ISP-B expects the ingress traffic to have a source address matching
        the prefix that it assigned to the site, 2001:db8:0:b000::/52.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.4-5">As discussed before, we rely completely on the internal host to set
        the source address of the packet properly. In the case of a packet
        sent by H31 to access the service in ISP-B at H61, we expect the
        packet to have the following addresses: (S=2001:db8:0:b010::31,
        D=2001:db8:0:6666::61). The routed network has two potential ways of
        distributing routes so that this packet exits the site on the uplink
        at SERb2.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.4-6">We could just rely on normal destination routes, without using
        source-prefix-scoped routes. If we have SERb2 originate a normal
        unscoped destination route for D=2001:db8:0:6666::/64, the packets
        from H31 to H61 will exit the site at SERb2 as desired. We should not
        have to worry about SERa needing to originate the same route, because
        ISP-B should choose a globally unique prefix for the service at
        H61.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.4-7">The alternative is to have SERb2 originate a source-prefix-scoped
        destination route of the form (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52,
        D=2001:db8:0:6666::/64). From a forwarding point of view, the use of
        the source-prefix-scoped destination route would result in traffic
        with source addresses corresponding only to ISP-B being sent to SERb2.
        Instead, the use of the unscoped destination route would result in
        traffic with source addresses corresponding to ISP-A and ISP-B being
        sent to SERb2, as long as the destination address matches the
        destination prefix. It seems like either forwarding behavior would be
        acceptable.</t>
        <t pn="section-4.4-8">However, from the point of view of the enterprise network
        administrator trying to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot this
        multihoming solution, it seems much clearer to have SERb2 originate
        the source-prefix-scoped destination route corresponding to the service
        offered by ISP-B. In this way, all of the traffic leaving the site is
        determined by the source-prefix-scoped routes, and all of the traffic
        within the site or arriving from external hosts is determined by the
        unscoped destination routes. Therefore, for this multihoming solution
        we choose to originate source-prefix-scoped routes for all traffic
        leaving the site.</t>

        further simplified by directly connecting all hosts to the LAN
        that connects the two site exit routers, SERa and SERb. The topology
        could also be simplified by connecting both uplinks to ISP-A and ISP-B 
        to the same site exit router. However, it is the aim of this
        document to provide a solution that applies to a broad range of
        enterprise site network topologies, so this document focuses on providing
        a solution to the more general case. The simplified cases will also be
        supported by this solution, and there may even be optimizations that

	      The final step is for R8 to augment the more specific source-prefix-scoped 
forwarding tables with entries from less specific source-prefix-scoped

scoped to ::/0, so both 2001:db8:0:a000::/52 and 2001:db8:0:b000::/52
are more specific prefixes of ::/0.  Therefore, entries in the unscoped
forwarding table will be evaluated to be added to these two
more specific source-prefix-scoped forwarding tables.   If a forwarding
entry from the less specific source-prefix-scoped forwarding table
has the exact same destination prefix (including destination prefix length)

      <t pn="section-6-1">Until this point, we have made the assumption that hosts are able to
      choose the correct source address using some unspecified mechanism. This
      has allowed us to focus on what the routers in a multihomed site
      network need to do in order to forward packets to the correct ISP based
      on source address. Now we look at possible mechanisms for hosts to
      choose the correct source address. We also look at what role, if any,
      the routers may play in providing information that helps hosts to choose
      source addresses.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-2">
       It should be noted that this section discusses how hosts could select 
       the default source address for new connections. Any connection that 
       already exists on a host is bound to a specific source address that
       cannot be changed. <xref target="sec_conn_pre" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.7"/> 
       discusses the connections preservation issue in more detail.
</t>
      <t pn="section-6-3">Any host that needs to be able to send traffic using the uplinks to a given ISP  
      is expected to be configured with an address from the prefix
      assigned by that ISP. The host will control which ISP is used for its
      traffic by selecting one of the addresses configured on the host as the
      source address for outgoing traffic. It is the responsibility of the
      site network to ensure that a packet with the source address from an ISP
      is now sent on an uplink to that ISP.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-4">If all of the ISP uplinks are working, then the host's choice of source address
      may be driven by the desire to load share across ISP
      uplinks, or it may be driven by the desire to take advantage of certain
      properties of a particular uplink or ISP (if some information about various 
      path properties has been made available to the host somehow. See 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PROV-DOMAINS"/> 
      as an example). If any of the ISP uplinks is
      not working, then the choice of source address by the host can cause 
      packets to get dropped.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-5">How a host selects a suitable source address
      in a multihomed site is not a solved problem. We do not attempt to solve
      this problem in this document. Instead we discuss the current state of
      affairs with respect to standardized solutions and the implementation of
      those solutions. We also look at proposed solutions for this
      problem.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-6">An external host initiating communication with a host internal to a
      PA-multihomed site will need to know multiple addresses for that host in
      order to communicate with it using different ISPs to the multihomed
      site (knowing just one address would undermine all benefits of redundant connectivity provided by multihoming). These addresses are typically learned through DNS. (For
      simplicity, we assume that the external host is single-homed.) The
      external host chooses the ISP that will be used at the remote multihomed
      site by setting the destination address on the packets it transmits. For
      a session originated from an external host to an internal host, the
      choice of source address used by the internal host is simple. The
      internal host has no choice but to use the destination address in the
      received packet as the source address of the transmitted packet.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-7">For a session originated by a host inside the multihomed site,
      the decision of which source address to select is more complicated. We
      consider three main methods for hosts to get information about the
      network. The two proactive methods are Neighbor Discovery Router
      Advertisements and DHCPv6. The one reactive method we consider is
      ICMPv6. Note that we are explicitly excluding the possibility of having
      hosts participate in, or even listen directly to, routing protocol
      advertisements.</t>
      <t pn="section-6-8">First we look at how a host is currently expected to select the
	      default source and destination addresses to be used for a new connection.</t>
      <section anchor="sec_host_address_selection_algo" numbered="true" toc="include" removeInRFC="false" pn="section-6.1">
        <name slugifiedName="name-default-source-address-sele">Default Source Address Selection Algorithm on Hosts</name>
        <t pn="section-6.1-1"><xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/> defines the algorithms that hosts are
        expected to use to select source and destination addresses for
        packets. It defines an algorithm for selecting a source address and a
        separate algorithm for selecting a destination address. Both of these
        algorithms depend on a policy table. <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/> defines
        a default policy that produces certain behavior.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-2">The rules in the two algorithms in <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/> depend
        on many different properties of addresses. While these are needed for
        understanding how a host should choose addresses in an arbitrary
        environment, most of the rules are not relevant for understanding how
        a host should choose among multiple source addresses in a multihomed
        environment when sending a
        packet to a remote host. Returning to the example in <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/>, we look at what the default algorithms in
        <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/> say about the source address that internal
        host H31 should use to send traffic to external host H101, somewhere
        on the Internet.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-3">There is no choice to be made with respect to destination address.
        H31 needs to send a packet with D=2001:db8:0:1234::101 in order to
        reach H101. So H31 has to choose between using S=2001:db8:0:a010::31
        or S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 as the source address for this packet. We go
	through the rules for source address selection in <xref target="RFC6724" sectionFormat="of" section="5" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5" derivedContent="RFC6724"/>. </t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-4"> Rule 1 (Prefer same address) is not useful to
        break the tie between source addresses because neither one of the candidate
	source addresses equals the destination address.  </t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-5"> Rule 2 (Prefer appropriate scope) is also not useful in this scenario because both
        source addresses and the destination address have global scope.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-6">Rule 3 (Avoid deprecated addresses) applies to an address that has
        been autoconfigured by a host using stateless address
        autoconfiguration as defined in <xref target="RFC4862" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4862"/>. An address
        autoconfigured by a host has a preferred lifetime and a valid
        lifetime. The address is preferred until the preferred lifetime
        expires, after which it becomes deprecated. A deprecated address is not
        used if there is a preferred address of the appropriate scope available.
        When the valid lifetime expires, the address cannot be used at all. The
        preferred and valid lifetimes for an autoconfigured address are set
        based on the corresponding lifetimes in the Prefix Information Option
        in Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisements. In this scenario, a
	possible tool to control source address selection in this scenario
	would be for a host to deprecate an address by having routers on that
	link, R1 and R2 in <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/>, send Router Advertisement messages
	containing PIOs with the Preferred Lifetime value for the deprecated
	source prefix set to zero. This is a rather blunt tool, because it discourages or prohibits the use
        of that source prefix for all destinations. However, it may be useful in some scenarios.
        For example, if all uplinks to a particular ISP fail, it is desirable to prevent hosts from
        using source addresses from that ISP address space.
        </t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-7">Rule 4 (Avoid home addresses) does not apply here because we are
        not considering Mobile IP.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-8">Rule 5 (Prefer outgoing interface) is not useful in this scenario
        because both source addresses are assigned to the same interface.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-9">Rule 5.5 (Prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by the next-hop) is not
        useful in the scenario when both R1 and R2 will advertise both source
        prefixes. However, this rule may potentially allow a host to select the
        correct source prefix by selecting a next-hop. The most obvious way
        would be to make R1 advertise itself as a default router and send
        PIO for 2001:db8:0:a010::/64, while R2 advertises itself as a
        default router and sends PIO for 2001:db8:0:b010::/64. We'll discuss
        later how Rule 5.5 can be used to influence a source address selection
        in single-router topologies (e.g., when H41 is sending traffic using R3
        as a default gateway).</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-10">Rule 6 (Prefer matching label) refers to the label value determined
        for each source and destination prefix as a result of applying the
        policy table to the prefix. With the default policy table defined in
        <xref target="RFC6724" sectionFormat="of" section="2.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-2.1" derivedContent="RFC6724"/>, Label(2001:db8:0:a010::31) =
        5, Label(2001:db8:0:b010::31) = 5, and Label(2001:db8:0:1234::101) =
        5. So with the default policy, Rule 6 does not break the tie. However,
        the algorithms in <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/> are defined in such a way
        that non-default address selection policy tables can be used. 
        <xref target="RFC7078" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7078"/> defines a way to distribute a non-default address
        selection policy table to hosts using DHCPv6. So even though the
        application of Rule 6 to this scenario using the default policy table
        is not useful, Rule 6 may still be a useful tool.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-11">Rule 7 (Prefer temporary addresses) has to do with the technique
        described in <xref target="RFC4941" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4941"/> to periodically randomize the
        interface portion of an IPv6 address that has been generated using
        stateless address autoconfiguration. In general, if H31 were using
        this technique, it would use it for both source addresses, for example,
        creating temporary addresses 2001:db8:0:a010:2839:9938:ab58:830f and
        2001:db8:0:b010:4838:f483:8384:3208, in addition to
        2001:db8:0:a010::31 and 2001:db8:0:b010::31. So this rule would prefer
        the two temporary addresses, but it would not break the tie between
        the two source prefixes from ISP-A and ISP-B.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-12">Rule 8 (Use longest matching prefix) dictates that, between two
candidate source addresses, the host selects the one that has 
longest common prefix length with the destination address. For example, if H31 were
        selecting the source address for sending packets to H101, this rule
        would not break the tie between candidate source addresses
        2001:db8:0:a101::31 and 2001:db8:0:b101::31 since the common prefix length
        with the destination is 48. However, if H31 were selecting the source
        address for sending packets to H41 address 2001:db8:0:a020::41, then this
        rule would result in using 2001:db8:0:a101::31 as a source
        (2001:db8:0:a101::31 and 2001:db8:0:a020::41 share the common prefix
        2001:db8:0:a000::/58, while for 2001:db8:0:b101::31 and
        2001:db8:0:a020::41, the common prefix is 2001:db8:0:a000::/51).
        Therefore Rule 8 might be useful for selecting the correct source
        address in some, but not all, scenarios (for example if ISP-B services
        belong to 2001:db8:0:b000::/59, then H31 would always use
        2001:db8:0:b010::31 to access those destinations).</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-13">So we can see that of the eight source address selection rules from
        <xref target="RFC6724" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6724"/>, four actually apply to our basic site
        multihoming scenario. The rules that are relevant to this scenario are

        traffic-driven feedback from the network. With the source address
        selection algorithm discussed above, the goal is to choose the correct
        source address on the first try, before any traffic is sent. However,
        another strategy is to choose a source address, send the packet, get
        feedback from the network about whether or not the source address is
        correct, and try another source address if it is not.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.1-17">We consider four scenarios in which a host needs to select the correct
        source address. In the first scenario, both uplinks are working. In
        the second scenario, one uplink has failed. The third scenario is a

The mechanism proposed in this document attempts to ensure that the subset of source addresses available for applications and upper-layer protocols is selected with the up-to-date network state in mind.

          Information Option (PIO) in the Router Advertisement (RA) message.
          When a host receives a PIO with the A-flag <xref target="RFC8425" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8425"/> set, it can use the

          <t pn="section-6.2.2-5">However, Rule 5.5 of the default source address selection algorithm (discussed

                  (specified in <xref target="RFC4191" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4191"/>)
          and RIO, can be used to influence a source
          address selection on a host as described below. Let's look at source
          address selection on the host H41. It receives RAs from R3 with PIOs
          for 2001:db8:0:a020::/64 and 2001:db8:0:b020::/64. At that point, all
          traffic would use the same next-hop (R3 link-local address) so Rule
          5.5 does not apply. Now let's assume that R3 supports SADR and has
          two scoped forwarding tables, one scoped to S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52
          and another scoped to S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52. If R3 generates two
          different link-local addresses for its interface facing H41 (one for
          each scoped forwarding table, LLA_A and LLA_B), R3 will send 
          two different RAs: one from LLA_A that includes a PIO for
          2001:db8:0:a020::/64, and another from LLA_B that includes a PIO
          for 2001:db8:0:b020::/64. Now it is possible to influence H41 source
          address selection for destinations that follow the default route by
          setting the default router preference in RAs. If it is desired that H41
          reaches H101 (or any destination in the Internet) via ISP-A, then
          RAs sent from LLA_A should have the default router preference set to 01
          (high priority), while RAs sent from LLA_B should have the preference
          set to 11 (low). LLA_A would then be chosen as a next-hop for H101,
          and therefore (per Rule 5.5) 2001:db8:0:a020::41 would be
          selected as the source address. If, at the same time, it is desired
          that H61 is accessible via ISP-B, then R3 should include a RIO for
          2001:db8:0:6666::/64 in its RA sent from LLA_B. H41 would choose
          LLA_B as a next-hop for all traffic to H61, and then per Rule 5.5,
          2001:db8:0:b020::41 would be selected as a source address.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.2-6">If in the above-mentioned scenario it is desirable that all
          Internet traffic leaves the network via ISP-A, and the link to ISP-B
          is used for accessing ISP-B services only (not as an ISP-A link
          backup), then RAs sent by R3 from LLA_B should have their Router Lifetime
          values set to zero and should include RIOs for ISP-B address space. It would
          instruct H41 to use LLA_A for all Internet traffic but to use LLA_B as
          a next-hop while sending traffic to ISP-B addresses.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.2-7">The description of the mechanism above assumes SADR support by the

          <t pn="section-6.2.3-1">We now discuss how one might use ICMPv6 to implement the routing
          policy to send traffic destined for H101 out the uplink to ISP-A,
          even when uplinks to both ISPs are working. If H31 started sending
          traffic to H101 with S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 and
          D=2001:db8:0:1234::101, it would be routed through SER-b1 and out
          the uplink to ISP-B. SERb1 could recognize that this traffic is
          not following the desired routing policy and react by sending an
          ICMPv6 message back to H31.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.3-2">In this example, we could arrange things so that SERb1 drops the
          packet with S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 and D=2001:db8:0:1234::101, and
          then sends to H31 an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message with
          Code 5 (Source address failed ingress/egress policy). When H31
          receives this packet, it would then be expected to try another
          source address to reach the destination. In this example, H31 would
          then send a packet with S=2001:db8:0:a010::31 and
          D=2001:db8:0:1234::101, which will reach SERa and be forwarded out
          the uplink to ISP-A.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.3-3">However, we would also want it to be the case that SERb1 does not
          enforce this routing policy when the uplink from SERa to ISP-A has
          failed. This could be accomplished by having SERa originate a
          source-prefix-scoped route for (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52,
          D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64), and have SERb1 monitor the presence of that
          route. If that route is not present (because SERa has stopped
          originating it), then SERb1 will not enforce the routing policy, and
          it will forward packets with S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 and
          D=2001:db8:0:1234::101 out its uplink to ISP-B.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.3-4">We can also use this source-prefix-scoped route originated by
          SERa to communicate the desired routing policy to SERb1. We can
          define an EXCLUSIVE flag to be advertised together with the IGP
          route for (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52, D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64). This
          would allow SERa to communicate to SERb that SERb should reject
          traffic for D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64 and respond with an ICMPv6
          Destination Unreachable Code 5 message, as long as the route for
	  (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52, D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64) is present. The definition of an EXCLUSIVE flag for SADR
	  advertisements in IGPs would require future standardization work.
  
          </t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.3-5">Finally, if we are willing to extend ICMPv6 to support this
          solution, then we could create a mechanism for SERb1 to tell the
          host which source address it should be using to successfully forward
          packets that meet the policy. In its current form, when SERb1 sends
          an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable Code 5 message, it is basically
          saying, "This source address is wrong. Try another source address."
          In the absence of a clear indication which address to try next, the host
          will iterate over all addresses assigned to the interface (e.g., various
          privacy addresses), which would lead to significant delays and degraded user experience. 
          It would be better if the ICMPv6 message could say, "This source
          address is wrong. Instead use a source address in
          S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52". </t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.3-6">However, using ICMPv6 for signaling source address information
          back to hosts introduces new challenges. Most routers currently have
          software or hardware limits on generating ICMP messages. A site
          administrator deploying a solution that relies on the SERs
          generating ICMP messages could try to improve the performance of
          SERs for generating ICMP messages. However, in a large network, it
          is still likely that ICMP message generation limits will be reached.
          As a result, hosts would not receive ICMPv6 back, which in turn leads
          to traffic blackholing and poor user experience. To improve the
          scalability of ICMPv6-based signaling, hosts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> cache the
          preferred source address (or prefix) for the given destination
          (which in turn might cause issues in the case of the corresponding
          ISP uplink failure - see <xref target="sec_one_uplink_failed" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3"/>). In
          addition, the same source prefix <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used for other
          destinations in the same /64 as the original destination address.
          The source prefix to the destination mapping <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a specific lifetime. Expiration of the
          lifetime <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> trigger the source address selection algorithm

          <t pn="section-6.2.4-1">So to summarize this section, we have looked at three methods for
          implementing a simple routing policy where all traffic for a given
          destination on the Internet needs to use a particular ISP, even when
          the uplinks to both ISPs are working.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.4-2">The default source address selection policy cannot distinguish
          between the source addresses needed to enforce this policy, so a
          non-default policy table using associating source and destination
          prefixes using label values would need to be installed on each host.
          A mechanism exists for DHCPv6 to distribute a non-default policy
          table, but such solution would heavily rely on DHCPv6 support by the host
          operating system. Moreover, there is no mechanism to translate
          desired routing/traffic engineering policies into policy tables on
          DHCPv6 servers. Therefore using DHCPv6 for controlling the address
          selection policy table is not recommended and <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be
          used.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.4-3">At the same time, Router Advertisements provide a reliable
          mechanism to influence the source address selection process via PIO, RIO,
          and default router preferences. As all those options have been
          standardized by the IETF and are supported by various operating systems,
          no changes are required on hosts. First-hop routers in the
          enterprise network need to be capable of sending different RAs for
          different SLAAC prefixes (either based on scoped forwarding tables
          or based on preconfigured policies).</t>
          <t pn="section-6.2.4-4">SERs can enforce the routing policy by sending ICMPv6 Destination
          Unreachable messages with Code 5 (Source address failed
          ingress/egress policy) for traffic sent with the wrong
          source address. The policy distribution could be automated by defining
          an EXCLUSIVE flag for the source-prefix-scoped route, which could then be
          set on the SER that originates the route. As ICMPv6 message
          generation can be rate limited on routers, it <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be used as
          the only mechanism to influence source address selection on hosts.
          While hosts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> select the correct source address for a given
          destination, the network <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> signal any source address issues back

        <t pn="section-6.3-1">Now we discuss whether DHCPv6, Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisements,
        and ICMPv6 can help a host choose the right source address when an
        uplink to one of the ISPs has failed. Again we look at the scenario in
        <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/>. This time we look at traffic from
        H31 destined for external host H501 at D=2001:db8:0:5678::501. We
        initially assume that the uplink from SERa to ISP-A is working and
        that the uplink from SERb1 to ISP-B is working.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.3-2">We assume there is no particular routing policy desired, so H31 is
        free to send packets with S=2001:db8:0:a010::31 or
        S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 and have them delivered to H501. For this
        example, we assume that H31 has chosen S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 so that
        the packets exit via SERb to ISP-B. Now we see what happens when the
        link from SERb1 to ISP-B fails. How should H31 learn that it needs to
        start sending packets to H501 with S=2001:db8:0:a010::31 in order
        to start using the uplink to ISP-A? We need to do this in a way that
        doesn't prevent H31 from still sending packets with
        S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 in order to reach H61 at
        D=2001:db8:0:6666::61.</t>

          <t pn="section-6.3.1-1">For this example, we assume that the site network in 
          <xref target="fig_isp_service" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 3"/> has a centralized DHCP server and that all
          routers act as DHCP relay agents. We assume that both of the
          addresses assigned to H31 were assigned via DHCP.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.1-2">We could try to have the DHCP server monitor the state of the
          uplink from SERb1 to ISP-B in some manner and then tell H31 that it
          can no longer use S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 by setting its valid
          lifetime to zero. The DHCP server could initiate this process by
          sending a Reconfigure message to H31 as described in 
          <xref target="RFC8415" sectionFormat="of" section="18.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8415#section-18.3" derivedContent="RFC8415"/>. Or the DHCP server can assign addresses
          with short lifetimes in order to force clients to renew them
          often.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.1-3">This approach would prevent H31 from using S=2001:db8:0:b010::31
          to reach a host on the Internet. However, it would also prevent
          H31 from using S=2001:db8:0:b010::31 to reach H61 at
          D=2001:db8:0:6666::61, which is not desirable.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.1-4">Another potential approach is to have the DHCP server monitor the
          uplink from SERb1 to ISP-B and control the choice of source address
          on H31 by updating its address selection policy table via the
          mechanism in <xref target="RFC7078" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7078"/>. The DHCP server could
          initiate this process by sending a Reconfigure message to H31. Note
          that <xref target="RFC8415" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8415"/> requires that Reconfigure messages use
          DHCP authentication. DHCP authentication could be avoided by using
          short address lifetimes to force clients to send Renew messages to
          the server often. If the host does not obtain its IP addresses from
          the DHCP server, then it would need to use the Information Refresh
          Time option defined in <xref target="RFC8415" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8415"/>.</t>

          address selection in the case of an uplink failure. If a particular
          prefix should not be used as a source for any destination, then the
          router needs to send an RA with the Preferred Lifetime field for that
          prefix set to zero.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.2-2">Let's consider a scenario in which all uplinks are operational, and
          H41 receives two different RAs from R3: one from LLA_A with a PIO for
          2001:db8:0:a020::/64 and the default router preference set to 11 (low), and
          another one from LLA_B with a PIO for 2001:db8:0:a020::/64, the default
          router preference set to 01 (high), and a RIO for 2001:db8:0:6666::/64.
          As a result, H41 uses 2001:db8:0:b020::41 as a source address for
          all Internet traffic, and those packets are sent by SERs to ISP-B. If
          SERb1's uplink to ISP-B fails, the desired behavior is that H41 stops
          using 2001:db8:0:b020::41 as a source address for all destinations
          but H61. To achieve that, R3 should react to SERb1's uplink failure
          (which could be detected as the disappearance of scoped route
          (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52, D=::/0)) by withdrawing
          itself as a default router. R3 sends a new RA from LLA_B with the Router
          Lifetime value set to zero (which means that it should not be used as
          the default router). That RA still contains a PIO for 2001:db8:0:b020::/64
          (for SLAAC purposes) and a RIO for 2001:db8:0:6666::/64 so that H41 can
          reach H61 using LLA_B as a next-hop and 2001:db8:0:b020::41 as a
          source address. For all traffic following the default route, LLA_A
          will be used as a next-hop and 2001:db8:0:a020::41 as a source
          address.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.2-3">If all of the uplinks to ISP-B have failed, source addresses from
ISP-B address space should not be used. In such a failure scenario,
the forwarding table scoped S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52 contains no
entries, indicating that R3 can instruct hosts to stop using source
addresses from 2001:db8:0:b000::/52 by sending RAs containing PIOs
with Preferred Lifetime values set to zero.</t>

          <t pn="section-6.3.3-1">Now we look at how ICMPv6 messages can provide information back
          to H31. We assume again that, at the time of the failure, H31 is
          sending packets to H501 using (S=2001:db8:0:b010::31,
          D=2001:db8:0:5678::501). When the uplink from SERb1 to ISP-B fails,
          SERb1 would stop originating its source-prefix-scoped route for the
          default destination (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52, D=::/0) as well as its
          unscoped default destination route. With these routes no longer in
          the IGP, traffic with (S=2001:db8:0:b010::31,
          D=2001:db8:0:5678::501) would end up at SERa based on the unscoped
          default destination route being originated by SERa. Since that
          traffic has the wrong source address to be forwarded to ISP-A, SERa
          would drop it and send a Destination Unreachable message with Code 5
          (Source address failed ingress/egress policy) back to H31. H31 would
          then know to use another source address for that destination and
          would try with (S=2001:db8:0:a010::31, D=2001:db8:0:5678::501). This
          would be forwarded to SERa based on the source-prefix-scoped default
          destination route still being originated by SERa, and SERa would
          forward it to ISP-A. As discussed above, if we are willing to extend
          ICMPv6, SERa can even tell H31 what source address it should use to
          reach that destination. The expected host behavior has been
	  discussed in <xref target="sec_both_working_icmpv6" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.2.3"/>. 
	  Using ICMPv6 would have the same scalability/rate limiting issues 
          that are discussed in <xref target="sec_both_working_icmpv6" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.2.3"/>. 
          An ISP-B uplink failure immediately makes source addresses from 2001:db8:0:b000::/52 
          unsuitable for external communication and might trigger a large 
          number of ICMPv6 packets being sent to hosts in that subnet.

          changing the source address used by a host when an uplink 
          fails, which eliminates DHCPv6 from the list of
          potential solutions. On the other hand, Router Advertisements
          provide a reliable mechanism to dynamically provide hosts with a
          list of valid prefixes to use as source addresses as well as to prevent
          the use of particular prefixes. While no additional new features are
          required to be implemented on hosts, routers need to be able to send
          RAs based on the state of scoped forwarding table entries and to
          react to network topology changes by sending RAs with particular
          parameters set.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.3.4-2">It seems that the use of ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable messages generated by
          the SER (or any SADR-capable) routers, together with the use of RAs
          to signal source address selection errors back to hosts, has the
          potential to provide a support mechanism.  However, scalability issues 
          may arise in large networks when topology suddenly changes. 
          Therefore, it is highly desirable that hosts are able to
          select the correct source address in the case of uplink failure, with

          of the SERb1 uplink to ISP-B
          leads to the disappearance of the (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52,
          D=::/0) entry from the forwarding table scoped to
          S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52 and, in turn, causes R3 to send RAs

of the scoped forwarding entry (S=2001:db8:0:b000::/52, D=::/0).
That reappearance acts as a signal for R3 to advertise itself as
a default router for ISP-B address space domain (to send RAs from LLA_B
with non-zero Router Lifetime).

          SERa1 uplink recovery would
          cause the (S=2001:db8:0:a000::/52, D=2001:db8:0:1234::/64) route to
          reappear in the routing table. In the absence of that, route packets to H101 are sent

          <t pn="section-6.5.2-1">As discussed in <xref target="sec_one_uplink_failed_ra" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.3.2"/>, an
          uplink failure causes the scoped default entry to disappear from the
          scoped forwarding table and triggers RAs with zero Router Lifetimes.
          Complete disappearance of all scoped entries for a given source
          prefix would cause the prefix to be withdrawn from hosts by setting the
          Preferred Lifetime value to zero in the PIO. If all uplinks (SERa, SERb1
          and SERb2) fail, hosts either lose their default routers and/or
          have no global IPv6 addresses to use as a source. (Note that 'uplink
          failure' might mean 'IPv6 connectivity failure with IPv4 still being
          reachable', in which case, hosts might fall back to IPv4 if there is
          IPv4 connectivity to destinations). As a result, intra-site
          connectivity is broken. One of the possible ways to solve it is to
          use ULAs.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.5.2-2">In addition to GUAs, all hosts have ULA addresses assigned, and these addresses are
          used for intra-site communication even if there is no GUA assigned
          to a host. To avoid accidental leaking of packets with ULA sources,
          SADR-capable routers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a scoped forwarding table for ULA
          source for internal routes but <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> have an entry for D=::/0 in
          that table. In the absence of (S=ULA_Prefix; D=::/0), first-hop
          routers will send dedicated RAs from a unique link-local source
          LLA_ULA with a PIO from ULA address space, a RIO for the ULA prefix, and
          Router Lifetime set to zero. The behavior is consistent with the
          situation when SERb1 lost the uplink to ISP-B (so there is no
          Internet connectivity from 2001:db8:0:b000::/52 sources), but those
          sources can be used to reach some specific destinations. In the case
          of ULA, there is no Internet connectivity from ULA sources, but they
          can be used to reach other ULA destinations. Note that ULA usage
          could be particularly useful if all ISPs assign prefixes via
          DHCP prefix delegation. In the absence of ULAs, upon the 
          failure of all uplinks, hosts would lose all
          their GUAs upon prefix-lifetime expiration, which again makes
	  intra-site communication impossible.</t>
          <t pn="section-6.5.2-3">
	  It should be noted that Rule 5.5 (prefer a prefix advertised by the selected next-hop)
	  takes precedence over the Rule 6 (prefer matching label, which ensures that GUA source addresses
	  are preferred over ULAs for GUA destinations). Therefore if ULAs are used, the network
	  administrator needs to ensure that, while the site has Internet connectivity, hosts do not
	  select a router that advertises ULA prefixes as their default router.

          <t pn="section-6.7.1-1">
                The proposed solution is not designed to preserve connection state in the 
case of an uplink failure. When all uplinks to an ISP go down, all transport connections 
established to/from that ISP address space will be interrupted (unless the transport 
protocol has specific multihoming support). That behavior is similar to the scenario 
of IPv4 multihoming with NAT when an uplink failure causes all connections to be NATed 
to completely different public IPv4 addresses. While it does sound suboptimal, it is 
determined by the nature of PA address space: if all uplinks to the particular ISP 
have failed, there is no path for the ingress traffic to reach the site, and the egress 
traffic is supposed to be dropped by the ingress filters <xref target="RFC2827" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BCP38"/>. 
The only potential way to overcome this limitation would be to run BGP with all ISPs 
and to advertise all site prefixes to all uplinks - a solution that shares all the drawbacks 
of using the PI address space without sharing its benefits. Networks willing and capable 
of running BGP and using PI are out of scope of this document.
          </t>
          <t pn="section-6.7.1-2">
                It should be noted that in the case of IPv4 NAT-based multihoming, uplink 
recovery could cause connection interruptions as well (unless packet forwarding is 
integrated with the tracking of existing NAT sessions so that the egress interface for the existing 
sessions is not changed). However, the proposed solution has the benefit of preserving 
the existing sessions during and after the restoration of the failed uplink. Unlike the uplink 
failure event, which causes all addresses from the affected prefix to be deprecated, 
the recovery would just add new, preferred addresses to a host without making any 
addresses unavailable. Therefore, connections established to and from those addresses 
do not have to be interrupted.

                While it's desirable for active connections to survive ISP failover events, 
such events affect the reachability of IP addresses assigned to hosts in sites using 
PA address space. Unless the transport (or higher-level protocols) is capable 
of surviving the host renumbering, the active connections will be broken. The proposed 
solution focuses on minimizing the impact of failover on new connections and on 
multipath-aware protocols.

        communicate with an external host and to exchange information about
        possible source and destination address pairs that they can use to
        communicate. The Shim6 working group also specified the REAchability Protocol

        address pairs and to find new working address pairs. A fundamental
        requirement for Shim6 is that both internal and external hosts need to
        support Shim6. That is, both the host internal to the multihomed site
        and the host external to the multihomed site need to support Shim6 in
        order for there to be any benefit for the internal host to run Shim6.
        The Shim6 protocol specification was published in 2009, but it has not

	      Using multipath transport (such as Multipath TCP (MPTCP) <xref target="RFC6824" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6824"/> 
              or multipath capabilities in QUIC) might solve the problems discussed in 
              <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/> since a multipath
transport would allow hosts to use multiple 
			source addresses for a single connection and to switch between those source 
			addresses when a particular address becomes unavailable or a new address 
			is assigned to the host interface. Therefore, if all hosts in the 
			enterprise network use only multipath transport for all 
			connections, the signaling solution described in 
                        <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/> might not be needed (it should be noted 
			that Source Address Dependent Routing would still be required to 
			deliver packets to the correct uplinks).
			At the time this document was written, multipath transport alone 
			could not be considered a solution for the problem of selecting the source 
			address in a multihomed environment. There are a significant number of

			unlikely that the situation will change in the foreseeable 
			future (even if new releases of operating systems support multipath protocols, 
                        there will be a long tail of legacy hosts). The solution for enterprise multihoming needs to work for the 
			least common denominator: hosts without multipath transport support. In 
			addition, not all protocols are using multipath transport. While 
			multipath transport would complement the solution described in <xref target="sec_host_mechanisms" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>, it could not be considered as a sole 
			solution to the problem of source address selection in multihomed

			On the other hand, PA-based multihoming could provide additional

protocols could leverage source address selection to achieve maximum path diversity (and potentially improved performance).

        <t pn="section-8.3-3">
			Therefore, the deployment of multipath protocols should not be considered 
as an alternative to the approach proposed in this document. Instead, both solutions complement 
each other, so deploying multipath protocols in a PA-based multihomed network proves mutually beneficial.

			controlling source address selection on hosts using ICMPv6 messages. 
Using ICMPv6 to influence source address selection allows an attacker to exhaust the list of candidate source
          addresses on the host by sending spoofed ICMPv6 Code 5 for all
          prefixes known on the network (therefore preventing a victim from
	  establishing communication with the destination host).
          Another possible attack vector is using ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
          Messages with Code 5 to steer the egress
          traffic towards the particular ISP, so the attacker can benefit from
          their ability doing traffic sniffing/interception
          in that ISP network.</t>
      <t pn="section-10-2">
	  To prevent those attacks, hosts <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> verify that the original packet 
header included in the ICMPv6 error message was actually sent by the host (to ensure that the 
ICMPv6 message was triggered by a packet sent by the host). 
      </t>
      <t pn="section-10-3">
	  As ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable Messages with Code 5 could be originated by any 
SADR-capable router within the domain (or even come from the Internet), the Generalized TTL 
Security Mechanism (GTSM) <xref target="RFC5082" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5082"/> cannot be applied. 
Filtering such ICMPv6 messages at the site border cannot be recommended as it would break 
the legitimate end-to-end error signaling mechanism for which ICMPv6 was designed.

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes two algorithms, one for source address selection and one for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.</t>
              <t>Default address selection as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers.  This document obsoletes RFC 3484.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus allowing the administrator to control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.</t>

              <t>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen. Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC 4861.</t>

              <t>This document describes the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6): an extensible mechanism for configuring nodes with network configuration parameters, IP addresses, and prefixes. Parameters can be provided statelessly, or in combination with stateful assignment of one or more IPv6 addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes.  DHCPv6 can operate either in place of or in addition to stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC).</t>
              <t>This document updates the text from RFC 3315 (the original DHCPv6 specification) and incorporates prefix delegation (RFC 3633), stateless DHCPv6 (RFC 3736), an option to specify an upper bound for how long a client should wait before refreshing information (RFC 4242), a mechanism for throttling DHCPv6 clients when DHCPv6 service is not available (RFC 7083), and relay agent handling of unknown messages (RFC 7283).  In addition, this document clarifies the interactions between models of operation (RFC 7550).  As such, this document obsoletes RFC 3315, RFC 3633, RFC 3736, RFC 4242, RFC 7083, RFC 7283, and RFC 7550.</t>

This allows hosts to manage connections to multiple networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home router provides connectivity through both a broadband and cellular network provider.  This document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs through a Router Advertisement (RA) option.  This RA option announces a PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between PvDs.

              <t>BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct source network.  As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks, the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment.  There are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming.  This document describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming in particular.  This memo updates RFC 2827.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.

              <t>This document defines the Shim6 protocol, a layer 3 shim for providing locator agility below the transport protocols, so that multihoming can be provided for IPv6 with failover and load-sharing properties, without assuming that a multihomed site will have a provider-independent IPv6 address prefix announced in the global IPv6 routing table.  The hosts in a site that has multiple provider- allocated IPv6 address prefixes will use the Shim6 protocol specified in this document to set up state with peer hosts so that the state can later be used to failover to a different locator pair, should the original one stop working.

              <t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.</t>
              <t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.  This  document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
