This document extends PASSporT to include\r\nan indication that a call has been diverted from its original\r\ndestination to a new one. This information can greatly improve the\r\ndecisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios.\r\nAlso specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a\r\nPASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in some\r\ndiversion scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 8224.","pub_date":"February 2021","keywords":["SIP","STIR","Identity"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8224"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8946","errata_url":null}
