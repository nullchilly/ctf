After broad consultations, ICANN in turn created the IANA\r\nStewardship Transition Coordination Group.  That group solicited\r\nproposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and\r\nprotocol parameters.  This document contains the IETF response to\r\nthat solicitation for protocol parameters.  It was included in an\r\naggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and\r\nnumbering resources that are being developed by their respective\r\noperational communities.  A reference to that response may be found\r\nin the introduction, and additional correspondence is included in the\r\nAppendix.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7979","errata_url":null}
