MPLS-TE graceful shutdown\r\nmechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in the\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\nThis document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to\r\nreduce or eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned\r\nshutdown of a network resource.  These operations are equally\r\napplicable to both MPLS-TE and its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)\r\nextensions.
