In particular, the \"gzip\" content\r\ncoding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages.\r\n\r\nContent codings can be used in request messages as well; however,\r\ndiscoverability is not on par with response messages.  This document\r\nextends the HTTP \"Accept-Encoding\" header field for use in responses,\r\nto indicate the content codings that are supported in requests.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":["HTTP","content-encoding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC9110"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7694","errata_url":null}
