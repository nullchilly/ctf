Since snooping is not\r\nstandardized, there are many mechanisms in use to identify the\r\nmulticast routers.  However, this can lead to interoperability issues\r\nbetween multicast routers and snooping switches from different\r\nvendors.\r\n\r\nThis document introduces a general mechanism that allows for the\r\ndiscovery of multicast routers.  This new mechanism, Multicast Router\r\nDiscovery (MRD), introduces a standardized means of identifying\r\nmulticast routers without a dependency on particular multicast\r\nrouting protocols.
