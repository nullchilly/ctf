This mechanism employs either\r\nCryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) or a new variant of the\r\nsame theme that uses the same format in the addresses.  The main idea\r\nin the new variant is that information about the multiple prefixes is\r\nincluded within the addresses themselves.  This is achieved by\r\ngenerating the interface identifiers of the addresses of a host as\r\nhashes of the available prefixes and a random number.  Then, the\r\nmultiple addresses are generated by prepending the different prefixes\r\nto the generated interface identifiers.  The result is a set of\r\naddresses, called Hash-Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently\r\nbound to each other.
