Return codes in RFC 3435 do not cover all possible specific situations that may ever occur in a gateway.  That is not possible and not necessary.  What is important is to ensure that the Call Agent that receives a return code behaves appropriately and consistently for the given situation.  The purpose of this document is to provide implementation guidelines to ensure that consistency.
