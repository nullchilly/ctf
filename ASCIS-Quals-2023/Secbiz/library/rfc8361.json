This\r\ndocument describes a solution to resolve this RPF check failure issue\r\nthrough centralized replication.  All ingress Routing Bridges\r\n(RBridges) send Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM)\r\ntraffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.  When\r\nthe centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the\r\npackets and forwards them to their destination RBridges using a\r\ndistribution tree established per the TRILL base protocol (RFC 6325).\r\nTo avoid RPF check failure on an RBridge sitting between the ingress\r\nRBridge and the centralized replication node, some change in the RPF\r\ncalculation algorithm is required.  RPF checks on each RBridge MUST\r\nbe calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress RBridge,\r\ninstead of being calculated using the actual ingress RBridge.
