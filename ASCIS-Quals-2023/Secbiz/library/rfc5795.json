It is\r\ndesigned to operate efficiently and robustly over various link\r\ntechnologies with different characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe ROHC framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was\r\ninitially defined in RFC 3095.  To improve and simplify the ROHC\r\nspecifications, this document explicitly defines the ROHC framework\r\nand the profile for uncompressed separately.  More specifically, the\r\ndefinition of the framework does not modify or update the definition\r\nof the framework specified by RFC 3095.\r\n\r\nThis specification obsoletes RFC 4995.  It fixes one interoperability\r\nissue that was erroneously introduced in RFC 4995, and adds some\r\nminor clarifications.
