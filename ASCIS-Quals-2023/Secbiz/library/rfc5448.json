The new\r\nkey derivation mechanism has been defined in the 3rd Generation\r\nPartnership Project (3GPP).  This specification allows its use in EAP\r\nin an interoperable manner.  In addition, EAP-AKA' employs SHA-256\r\ninstead of SHA-1.\r\n\r\nThis specification also updates RFC 4187, EAP-AKA, to prevent bidding\r\ndown attacks from EAP-AKA'.
