Using the\r\nPresence Information Data Format (PIDF), each presence publication\r\ncontains full state, regardless of how much of that information has\r\nactually changed since the previous update.  As a consequence,\r\nupdating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a\r\nconsiderable overhead and is therefore inefficient.  Especially with\r\nlow bandwidth and high latency links, this can constitute a\r\nconsiderable burden to the system.  This memo defines a solution that\r\naids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases\r\ntransport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for\r\npublication of partial presence information.
