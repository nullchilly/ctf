For many years, the Cryptographic Message Syntax\r\n(CMS) has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.\r\nOver time, binary object encodings such as ASN.1 have become less\r\ncommon than text-based encodings, such as the JavaScript Object\r\nNotation (JSON).  This document defines a set of use cases and\r\nrequirements for a secure object format encoded using JSON, drawn\r\nfrom a variety of application security mechanisms currently in\r\ndevelopment.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["JWS","JWE","JWK","JWA","JWT","CMS","S\/MIME","JOSE","XMPP","ALTO","OAuth"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7165","errata_url":null}
