Tetrys may recover from\r\nerasures within an RTT-independent delay thanks to the transmission\r\nof coded packets. This document is a record of the experience gained\r\nby the authors while developing and testing the Tetrys protocol in\r\nreal conditions.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Coding for Efficient NetWork\r\nCommunications Research Group (NWCRG).
