This document defines a cryptographic transform\r\nfor the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that uses two\r\nseparate but related cryptographic operations to provide hop-by-hop\r\nand end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and\r\nhop-by-hop cryptographic algorithms can utilize an authenticated\r\nencryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithm or take advantage of\r\nfuture SRTP transforms with different properties.","pub_date":"April 2020","keywords":["PERC","SRTP","RTP","conferencing","encryption"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8723","errata_url":null}
