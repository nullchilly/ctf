The model\r\nprovides a network-centric view of L3VPN services.\r\n\r\nThe L3NM is meant to be used by a network controller to derive the\r\nconfiguration information that will be sent to relevant network\r\ndevices. The model can also facilitate communication between a\r\nservice orchestrator and a network controller\/orchestrator.","pub_date":"February 2022","keywords":["l3vpn","Automation","Service Provisioning","Network Automation","Service Orchestration","Service Delivery","NETCONF","RESTCONF","Slices","network slicing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9182","errata_url":null}
