These payloads add support for\r\nprivate (internal-only) DNS domains.  These domains are intended to\r\nbe resolved using non-public DNS servers that are only reachable\r\nthrough the IPsec connection.  DNS resolution for other domains\r\nremains unchanged.  These Configuration Payloads only apply to split-\r\ntunnel configurations.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["IKEv2","DNS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8598","errata_url":null}
