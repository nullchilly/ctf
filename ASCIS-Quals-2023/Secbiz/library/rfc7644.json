The specification suite seeks\r\nto build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments,\r\nplacing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and\r\nintegration, while applying existing authentication, authorization,\r\nand privacy models.  SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and\r\ncomplexity of user management operations by providing a common user\r\nschema, an extension model, and a service protocol defined by this\r\ndocument.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["SCIM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7644","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7644"}
