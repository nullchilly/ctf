In the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for\r\nthe delivery of multimedia content to a mobile terminal, where each\r\nuser is receiving a separate stream from the server. From a bandwidth\r\nand routing perspective, this approach is inefficient. Evolved\r\nmultimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides\r\ncapabilities for delivering contents to multiple users\r\nsimultaneously, but its deployment is very limited or at an\r\nexperimental stage due to numerous challenges. The focus of this\r\ndocument is to list the options for using Information-Centric\r\nNetworking (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate the experimental\r\nsetups for its further evaluation. The experimental setups discussed\r\nprovide guidance for using ICN either natively or with an existing\r\nmobility protocol stack. With further investigations based on the\r\nlisted experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as\r\nnetwork-layer multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized\r\ndata delivery using local caching at the edge may provide a viable\r\nalternative to IP transport in 4G mobile networks.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["LTE","ICN","ICN-4G","ICNoIP","IPoICN","HybridICN","Dual Trannsport"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9269","errata_url":null}
