This memo reserves the EMSK for the sole purpose of\r\nderiving root keys.  Root keys are master keys that can be used for\r\nmultiple purposes, identified by usage definitions.  This document\r\nalso specifies a mechanism for avoiding conflicts between root keys\r\nby deriving them in a manner that guarantees cryptographic\r\nseparation.  Finally, this document also defines one such root key\r\nusage: Domain-Specific Root Keys are root keys made available to and\r\nused within specific key management domains.
