Intelligent access selection, taking into account link-layer\r\nattributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different\r\ninformation types to the terminal from different sources within the\r\nnetwork and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this\r\nsignalling have both transport and security issues that must be\r\nconsidered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link\r\ntypes, so there is at least a common component to the signalling\r\nproblem, which is within the scope of the IETF.  This document presents a\r\nproblem statement for this core problem.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2008","keywords":["intelligent access selection","ip handover mechanism"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5164","errata_url":null}
