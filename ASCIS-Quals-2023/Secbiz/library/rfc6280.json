These applications need to securely gather and\r\ntransfer location information for location services, and at the same\r\ntime protect the privacy of the individuals involved.  This document\r\ndescribes an architecture for privacy-preserving location-based\r\nservices in the Internet, focusing on authorization, security, and\r\nprivacy requirements for the data formats and protocols used by these\r\nservices.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":["geolocation","geopriv"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3693","RFC3694"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0160"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6280","errata_url":null}
