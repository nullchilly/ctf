This document provides a description\r\nof the network and element management architectures that could be\r\napplied and also describes heuristics associated with fault,\r\nconfiguration, and performance aspects of the management system.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) \/ International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication\r\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport\r\nProfile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the\r\ncapabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network. \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2010","keywords":["mpls-tp","network management framework"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5950","errata_url":null}
