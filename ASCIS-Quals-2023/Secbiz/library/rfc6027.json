It also describes gaps in existing standards and their\r\nimplementation that need to be filled in order to allow peers to\r\ninteroperate with clusters from different vendors.  Agreed upon\r\nterminology, problem statement, and requirements will allow IETF\r\nworking groups to consider development of IPsec\/IKEv2 mechanisms to\r\nsimplify cluster implementations.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["IKE","IKEv2","high-availability","load-sharing","failover","hot-standby"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6027","errata_url":null}
