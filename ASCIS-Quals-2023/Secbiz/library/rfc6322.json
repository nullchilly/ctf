The states and annotations that are to be added to the\r\nDatatracker will be applied to Internet-Drafts as soon as any of\r\nthese streams identify the Internet-Draft as a potential eventual\r\nRFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the Internet-Draft.\r\nThe goal of adding this information to the Datatracker is to give the\r\nwhole Internet community more information about the status of these\r\nInternet-Drafts and the streams from which they originate.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2011","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6322","errata_url":null}
