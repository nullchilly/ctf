RFC 5681 explicitly allows\r\ncertain modifications of these algorithms, including modifications\r\nthat use the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option (RFC 2883),\r\nand modifications that respond to \"partial acknowledgments\" (ACKs\r\nthat cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was\r\ndetected) in the absence of SACK.  This document describes a specific\r\nalgorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as\r\n\"NewReno\".  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed\r\nby Janey Hoe.  This document obsoletes RFC 3782.
