This behavior is different from\r\nauthentication mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2,\r\nIntermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), RIP, and Routing\r\nInformation Protocol Next Generation (RIPng)).  In some environments,\r\nit has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain\r\nand thus cannot be used.  This document defines an alternative\r\nmechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does\r\nnot depend only upon IPsec for authentication.\r\n\r\nThe OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer was originally defined in RFC 6506.\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 6506 by providing a revised definition,\r\nincluding clarifications and refinements of the procedures.","pub_date":"March 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6506"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7166","errata_url":null}
