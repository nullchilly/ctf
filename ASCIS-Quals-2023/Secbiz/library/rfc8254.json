That requirement\r\ndiscouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems\r\nthat could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed\r\nby RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging\r\nregistration and publication of information for all appropriate\r\nnamespaces.  This document clarifies the status of relevant older\r\nRFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected\r\nexisting registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and\r\n3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN\r\nand ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions\r\nreside in registration templates.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":["ISBN","ISSN","NBN","national bibliography number"],"obsoletes":["RFC3044","RFC3187"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8254","errata_url":null}
