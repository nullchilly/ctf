However, recent Bluetooth specifications allow the\r\nformation of extended topologies as well. This document specifies\r\nmechanisms that are needed to enable IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE\r\nlinks established by using the Bluetooth Internet Protocol Support\r\nProfile (IPSP). This document does not specify the routing protocol\r\nto be used in an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links.","pub_date":"December 2021","keywords":["Bluetooth Low Energy","mesh networks","6lowpan","IPv6","Low power","IoT","Internet of Things"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9159","errata_url":null}
