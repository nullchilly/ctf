The work on\r\nMPLS-TP has extended the MPLS technology with additional\r\narchitectural elements and functions that can be used in any MPLS\r\ndeployment.  MPLS-TP is a set of functions and features selected from\r\nthe extended MPLS toolset and applied in a consistent way to meet the\r\nneeds and requirements of operators of packet transport networks.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of development of the profile, additions to the\r\nMPLS toolset have been made to ensure that the tools available met\r\nthe requirements.  These additions were motivated by MPLS-TP, but\r\nform part of the wider MPLS toolset such that any of them could be\r\nused in any MPLS deployment.\r\n\r\nOne major set of additions provides enhanced support for Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM).  This enables fault management\r\nand performance monitoring to the level needed in a transport\r\nnetwork.  Many solutions and protocol extensions have been proposed\r\nto address the requirements for MPLS-TP OAM, and this document sets\r\nout the reasons for selecting a single, coherent set of solutions for\r\nstandardization.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"July 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6670","errata_url":null}
