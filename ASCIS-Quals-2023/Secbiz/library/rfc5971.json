The design uses existing transport and security\r\nprotocols under a common messaging layer, the General Internet\r\nSignalling Transport (GIST), which provides a common service for\r\ndiverse signalling applications.  GIST does not handle signalling\r\napplication state itself, but manages its own internal state and the\r\nconfiguration of the underlying transport and security protocols to\r\nenable the transfer of messages in both directions along the flow\r\npath.  The combination of GIST and the lower layer transport and\r\nsecurity protocols provides a solution for the base protocol\r\ncomponent of the \"Next Steps in Signalling\" (NSIS) framework.  \r\nThis document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"October 2010","keywords":["nsis","next steps in signaling"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5971","errata_url":null}
