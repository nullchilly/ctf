The protocol relies on DTLS version 1.2 or later for\r\ncommunication security between entities in a constrained network\r\nusing either raw public keys or pre-shared keys. A\r\nresource-constrained server can use this protocol to delegate\r\nmanagement of authorization information to a trusted host with\r\nless-severe limitations regarding processing power and memory.","pub_date":"August 2022","keywords":["Internet of Thinks (IoT)","Internet of Things","IOT","OAuth","Access Token"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9430"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9202","errata_url":null}
