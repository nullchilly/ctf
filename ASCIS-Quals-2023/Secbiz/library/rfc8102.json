The\r\nresulting remote-LFA next hops (also called \"PQ-nodes\") may not\r\nguarantee node protection for all destinations being protected by it.\r\n\r\nThis document describes an extension to the remote-loop-free-based IP\r\nfast reroute mechanisms that specifies procedures for determining\r\nwhether or not a given PQ-node provides node protection for a\r\nspecific destination.  The document also shows how the same procedure\r\ncan be utilized for the collection of complete characteristics for\r\nalternate paths.  Knowledge about the characteristics of all\r\nalternate paths is a precursor to applying the operator-defined\r\npolicy for eliminating paths not fitting the constraints.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["LFA","Remote-LFA","IGP","Node Protection"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8102","errata_url":null}
