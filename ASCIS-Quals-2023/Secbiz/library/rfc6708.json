This includes, but\r\nis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\r\nof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\r\nguidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts\r\nfrom a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.\r\nThis guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance\r\nand efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the\r\ntopological distance.  The ultimate goal is to improve performance or\r\nQuality of Experience in the application while reducing the\r\nutilization of the underlying network infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis document enumerates requirements for specifying, assessing, or\r\ncomparing protocols and implementations.  This document is not an \r\nInternet Standards Track specification; it is published for \r\ninformational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6708","errata_url":null}
