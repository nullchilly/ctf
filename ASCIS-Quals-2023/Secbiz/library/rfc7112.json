The specification also allows options that can, in turn,\r\nextend each of the headers.  In those scenarios in which the IPv6\r\nHeader Chain or options are unusually long and packets are\r\nfragmented, or scenarios in which the fragment size is very small,\r\nthe First Fragment of a packet may fail to include the entire IPv6\r\nHeader Chain.  This document discusses the interoperability and\r\nsecurity problems of such traffic, and updates RFC 2460 such that the\r\nFirst Fragment of a packet is required to contain the entire IPv6\r\nHeader Chain.","pub_date":"January 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2460"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7112","errata_url":null}
