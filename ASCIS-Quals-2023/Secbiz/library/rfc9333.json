Instead, a minimal implementation is expected to\r\nbe optimized for constrained environments while remaining\r\ninteroperable with implementations of ESP. In addition, this document\r\nprovides some considerations for implementing minimal ESP in a\r\nconstrained environment, such as limiting the number of flash writes,\r\nhandling frequent wakeup and sleep states, limiting wakeup time, and\r\nreducing the use of random generation. \r\n\r\nThis document does not update or modify RFC 4303. It provides a\r\ncompact description of how to implement the minimal version of that\r\nprotocol. RFC 4303 remains the authoritative description.","pub_date":"January 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9333","errata_url":null}
