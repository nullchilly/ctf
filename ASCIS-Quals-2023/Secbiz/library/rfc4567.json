These extensions are presented as a framework, to\r\nbe used by one or more key management protocols.  As such, their use\r\nis meaningful only when complemented by an appropriate key management\r\nprotocol.\r\n\r\nGeneral guidelines are also given on how the framework should be used\r\ntogether with SIP and RTSP.  The usage with the Multimedia Internet\r\nKEYing (MIKEY) key management\r\nprotocol is also defined.
