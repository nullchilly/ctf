Many implementations have been using the \"QCP\" file format (named for its file extension) for exchanging QCELP 13K data as well as Enhanced Variable Rate Coder (EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV) data.  (For example, Eudora(r), QuickTime(r), and cmda2000(r) handsets).  This document specifies the QCP file format and updates the audio\/qcelp media registration to specify this format for storage, and registers the audio\/evrc-qcp and audio\/smv-qcp media types for EVRC and SMV (respectively) data stored in this format.
