The goal of this document is to define a\r\ngeneral architecture for IPv6-based home networking, describing the\r\nassociated principles, considerations, and requirements.  The text\r\nbriefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6\r\nfor home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and\r\nsuggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed\r\nin home networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific\r\nprotocol extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is\r\nassumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed and runs\r\nas an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations\r\nin this text for the IPv4 part of the network.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7368","errata_url":null}
