It defines\r\nthe TCP Window Scale (WS) option and the TCP Timestamps (TS) option\r\nand their semantics.  The Window Scale option is used to support\r\nlarger receive windows, while the Timestamps option can be used for\r\nat least two distinct mechanisms, Protection Against Wrapped\r\nSequences (PAWS) and Round-Trip Time Measurement (RTTM), that are\r\nalso described herein.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 1323 and describes changes from it.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["Timestamps","Timestamp","RTT","RTTM","Window Scale","PAWS","TCP options"],"obsoletes":["RFC1323"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7323","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7323"}
