This document describes a method of accomplishing this\r\nby using a technique called \"Synonymous Flow Labels\" in which labels\r\nthat mimic the behavior of other labels provide the identification\r\nservice. These identifiers can be used to trigger per-flow operations\r\non the packet at the receiving label switching router.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["MPLS","Flow","Label"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8957","errata_url":null}
