Incorporating such an update\r\nmechanism is a fundamental requirement for fixing vulnerabilities,\r\nbut it also enables other important capabilities such as updating\r\nconfiguration settings and adding new functionality.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the definition of terminology and an architecture,\r\nthis document provides the motivation for the standardization of a\r\nmanifest format as a transport-agnostic means for describing and\r\nprotecting firmware updates.","pub_date":"April 2021","keywords":["IoT","update","software","firmware","constrained","Secure","Boot"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9019","errata_url":null}
