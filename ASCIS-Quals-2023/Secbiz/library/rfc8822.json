The encapsulation method\r\nspecified in this document supports the multiplexing of traffic for\r\nmultiple PDU sessions within a VLAN-delineated access circuit,\r\npermits legacy equipment in the data path to inspect certain packet\r\nfields, carries 5G QoS information associated with the packet data,\r\nand provides efficient encoding. It achieves this by specific points\r\nof similarity with the Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)\r\ndata packet encapsulation (RFC 2516).","pub_date":"April 2021","keywords":["PPPoE","W-AGF","QFI","RQI","WWC"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8822","errata_url":null}
