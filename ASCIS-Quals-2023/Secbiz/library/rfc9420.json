Establishing keys to provide such protections\r\nis challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two\r\nclients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same\r\ntime.  In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol that\r\nprovides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with forward\r\nsecrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) for groups in size\r\nranging from two to thousands.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9420","errata_url":null}
