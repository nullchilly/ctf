The\r\nextensions are based on the use of the Interactive Connectivity\r\nEstablishment (ICE) methodology to discover a working path between\r\ntwo end-hosts, and on standard techniques for encapsulating\r\nEncapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets within the User Datagram\r\nProtocol (UDP).  This document also defines elements of a procedure\r\nfor NAT traversal, including the optional use of a HIP relay server.\r\nWith these extensions HIP is able to work in environments that have\r\nNATs and provides a generic NAT traversal solution to higher-layer\r\nnetworking applications.  This document defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"April 2010","keywords":["[--------]","ICE","HIP relay"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5770","errata_url":null}
