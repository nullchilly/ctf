NFS\r\nimplementations historically incur significant overhead due to data\r\ncopies on end-host systems, as well as other processing overhead.\r\nThis document explores the potential benefits of RDMA to these\r\nimplementations and evaluates the reasons why RDMA is especially\r\nwell-suited to NFS and network file protocols in general.  This \r\nmemo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"May 2009","keywords":["RPC","XDR","ONC","RDDP","NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5532","errata_url":null}
