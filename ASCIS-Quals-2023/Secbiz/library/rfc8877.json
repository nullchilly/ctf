This document specifies guidelines for\r\ndefining packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various\r\nlayers. It also presents three recommended timestamp formats. The\r\ntarget audience of this document includes network protocol designers.\r\nIt is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet\r\ntimestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp\r\nformats. If none of the recommended formats fits the protocol\r\nrequirements, the new protocol specification should specify the\r\nformat of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this\r\ndocument.","pub_date":"September 2020","keywords":["Timestamps"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8877","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8877"}
