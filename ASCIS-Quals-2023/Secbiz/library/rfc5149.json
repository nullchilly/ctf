A capability to specify different\r\nservices in addition to the mobile node identity can be leveraged to\r\nprovide flexibility for mobility service providers on provisioning\r\nmultiple services to one mobility service subscription.  This\r\ndocument describes a Service Selection Mobility Option for both\r\nconventional Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 that is intended to\r\nassist home agents to make a specific service selection for the\r\nmobility service subscription during the binding registration\r\nprocedure.
