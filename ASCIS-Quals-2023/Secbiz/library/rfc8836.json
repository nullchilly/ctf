The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real-time\r\nmultimedia, which needs low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery, are\r\ndifferent from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or bursty\r\ntransfers like web pages. Due to an increasing amount of RTP-based\r\nreal-time media traffic on the Internet (e.g., with the introduction\r\nof the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)), it is especially\r\nimportant to ensure that this kind of traffic is congestion\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nThis document describes a set of requirements that can be used to\r\nevaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure out\r\ntheir fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of\r\npossible requirements for a real-time media congestion avoidance\r\ntechnique.","pub_date":"January 2021","keywords":["Interactive multimedia","webrtc","video communication","RTP\/RTCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8836","errata_url":null}
