While most already have some method\r\nfor accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases\r\nthe existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ\r\ncryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.  The \"Keying and              \r\nAuthentication for Routing Protocols\" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul\r\nand improve these mechanisms.  This document does not contain\r\nprotocol specifications.  Instead, it defines the areas where\r\nprotocol specification work is needed.  This document is a companion\r\ndocument to RFC 6518, \"Keying and Authentication for Routing\r\nProtocols (KARP) Design Guidelines\"; together they form the guidance\r\nand instruction KARP design teams will use to review and overhaul\r\nrouting protocol transport security.","pub_date":"March 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6862","errata_url":null}
