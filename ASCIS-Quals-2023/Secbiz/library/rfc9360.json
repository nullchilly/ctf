For some algorithms, additional\r\nproperties are defined that carry parameters relating to keys as\r\nneeded.  The COSE Key structure is used for transporting keys outside\r\nof COSE messages.  This document extends the way that keys can be\r\nidentified and transported by providing attributes that refer to or\r\ncontain X.509 certificates.","pub_date":"February 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9360","errata_url":null}
