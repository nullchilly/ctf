This CLF\r\nmimics the successful event logging format found in well-known web\r\nservers like Apache and web proxies like Squid.  This document\r\nproposes an indexed text encoding format for the SIP CLF that retains\r\nthe key advantages of a text-based format while significantly\r\nincreasing processing performance over a purely text-based\r\nimplementation.  This file format adheres to the SIP CLF information\r\nmodel and provides an effective encoding scheme for all mandatory and\r\noptional fields that appear in a SIP CLF record.
