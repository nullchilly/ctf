This current practice can\r\nsignificantly compromise your privacy, and something should change in\r\norder to mitigate these privacy threats.\r\n\r\nThere are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of\r\nprotocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all.  This document\r\ndescribes some of the protocols that reveal hostnames today and\r\nsketches another possible remedy, which is to replace static\r\nhostnames by frequently changing randomized values.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8117","errata_url":null}
