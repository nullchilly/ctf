These connections will then be subject to\r\nhigh-availability mechanisms enabled on the network side.\r\n\r\nThis approach assumes that applications and\/or users have more\r\nvisibility about sensitive connections than any heuristic that can be\r\nenabled on the network side to guess which connections should be\r\ncheck-pointed.","pub_date":"February 2016","keywords":["serviceability","SDN","resilience","robustness","network programmability","network API","application control","service-aware networking","automation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7767","errata_url":null}
