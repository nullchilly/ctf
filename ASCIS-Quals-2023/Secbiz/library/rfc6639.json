These MIB modules are\r\ndefined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of\r\nresponsibility of the modules that they describe.\r\n\r\nThe MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS\r\nfunctionality specific to the construction of packet-switched\r\ntransport networks.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP,\r\nindicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB\r\nmodules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management, and\r\nidentifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6639","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6639"}
