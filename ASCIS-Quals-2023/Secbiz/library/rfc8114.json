The\r\nsolution relies upon a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme\r\nand uses an IPv6 multicast distribution tree to deliver IPv4\r\nmulticast traffic.  The solution is particularly useful for the\r\ndelivery of multicast service offerings to customers serviced by\r\nDual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite).","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["Multicast","DS-Lite","IPv4-IPv6 Interconnection","PREFIX64","SSM","ASM","IPv4 service continuity","Multicast service continuity","IPv6-only","IPv6-only multicast","PIM","MLD","IGMP","A+P","MAP","MAP-E","address-sharing","CGN","NAT64","IPv4 over IPv6","IPv6 Address Synthesis","Any-Source Multicast","Source-Specific Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8114","errata_url":null}
