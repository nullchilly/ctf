The length of an\r\nIPv6 prefix may be any number from zero to 128, although subnets\r\nusing stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for address\r\nallocation conventionally use a \/64 prefix.  Hardware and software\r\nimplementations of routing and forwarding should therefore impose no\r\nrules on prefix length, but implement longest-match-first on prefixes\r\nof any valid length.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["IPv6 Routing","CIDR","Classless Inter-Domain Routing","IPv6 Addressing Architecture","IPv6 Forwarding Information Base","IPv6 Routing Information Base","FIB","RIB","IPv6 Deployment"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0198"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7608","errata_url":null}
