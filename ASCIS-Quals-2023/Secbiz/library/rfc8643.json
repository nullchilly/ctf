OSRTP\r\nallows encrypted media to be used in environments where support for\r\nencryption is not known in advance and is not required.  OSRTP does\r\nnot require Session Description Protocol (SDP) extensions or features\r\nand is fully backwards compatible with existing implementations using\r\nencrypted and authenticated media and implementations that do not\r\nencrypt or authenticate media packets.  OSRTP is not specific to any\r\nkey management technique for Secure RTP (SRTP).  OSRTP is a\r\ntransitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments of\r\nreal-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated\r\nstate.","pub_date":"August 2019","keywords":["srtp","opportunistic security","encryption","best effort","osrtp"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8643","errata_url":null}
