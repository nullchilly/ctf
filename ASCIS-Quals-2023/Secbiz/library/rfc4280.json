BCMCS is\r\nbeing developed for Third generation (3G) cellular telephone\r\nnetworks.  Users of the service interact with a controller in the\r\nnetwork via the Mobile Node (MN) to derive information required to\r\nreceive Broadcast and Multicast Service.  Dynamic Host Configuration\r\nProtocol can be used to configure the MN to access a particular\r\ncontroller.  This document defines the related options and option\r\ncodes.
