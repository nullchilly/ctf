Although some service monitoring\r\nplatforms can test the functionality of the DNS itself, there is not\r\nan interoperable way to manage (monitor, control, and configure) the\r\ninternal aspects of a name server itself.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses the requirements of a management system for\r\nname servers and can be used as a shopping list of needed features\r\nfor such a system.
