Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) for such\r\na BNG improves flexibility and scalability but requires various\r\ncommunication between the User Plane (UP) and the Control Plane (CP).\r\n China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a simple\r\nCUPS control channel protocol to support such communication: the\r\nSimple Control and User Plane Separation Protocol (S-CUSP). S-CUSP is\r\ndefined in this document. \r\n\r\nThis document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF\r\nconsensus.  S-CUSP is presented here to make its specification\r\nconveniently available to the Internet community to enable diagnosis\r\nand interoperability.","pub_date":"May 2020","keywords":["CUPS","CUSP","BRAS","BBRAS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8772","errata_url":null}
