This document is limited\r\nto BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.  This\r\nmodel is intended to be instantiated at the management system to\r\ndeliver the overall service.  It is not a configuration model to be\r\nused directly on network elements.  This model provides an abstracted\r\nview of the Layer 3 IP VPN service configuration components.  It will\r\nbe up to the management system to take this model as input and use\r\nspecific configuration models to configure the different network\r\nelements to deliver the service.  How the configuration of network\r\nelements is done is out of scope for this document.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":["YANG","l3sm","l3vpn","service model"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8299"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8049","errata_url":null}
