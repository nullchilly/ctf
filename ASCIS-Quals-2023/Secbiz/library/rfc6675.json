The\r\nalgorithm presented in this document conforms to the spirit of the current\r\ncongestion control specification (RFC 5681), but allows TCP senders to recover\r\nmore effectively when multiple segments are lost from a single flight of data.\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3517 and describes changes from it.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"August 2012","keywords":["[--------]","transmission control protocol","retransmission","congestion control"],"obsoletes":["RFC3517"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6675","errata_url":null}
