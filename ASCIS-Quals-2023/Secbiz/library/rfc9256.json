Intermediate per-path states are eliminated thanks to source\r\nrouting. SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e.,\r\ninstructions) that represent a source-routed policy. Packet flows are\r\nsteered into an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated called a\r\nheadend node. The packets steered into an SR Policy carry an ordered\r\nlist of segments associated with that SR Policy.\r\n\r\nThis document updates RFC 8402 as it details the concepts of SR\r\nPolicy and steering into an SR Policy.","pub_date":"July 2022","keywords":["Segment Routing","SR Policy","SR-MPLS","SRv6","Traffic Engineering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8402"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9256","errata_url":null}
