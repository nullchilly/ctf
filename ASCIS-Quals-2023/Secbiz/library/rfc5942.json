This document\r\nalso updates (partially due to security concerns caused by incorrect\r\nimplementations) a part of the definition of \"on-link\" from RFC 4861.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"July 2010","keywords":["[--------]"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4861"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5942","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5942"}
