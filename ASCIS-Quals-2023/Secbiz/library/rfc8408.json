Currently, TE paths are Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\r\nthat are set up using the RSVP-TE signaling protocol.  However, other\r\nTE path setup methods are possible within the PCE architecture.  This\r\ndocument proposes an extension to the PCE Communication Protocol\r\n(PCEP) to allow support for different path setup methods over a given\r\nPCEP session.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8664"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8408","errata_url":null}
