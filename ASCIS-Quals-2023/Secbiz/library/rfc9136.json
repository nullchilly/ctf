This document defines a new EVPN route\r\ntype for the advertisement of IP prefixes and explains some use-case\r\nexamples where this new route type is used.","pub_date":"October 2021","keywords":["RT5","RT-5","Type-5","Interface-less","Interface-ful"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9136","errata_url":null}
