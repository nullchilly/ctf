This method\r\nis meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers\r\nbased on hardware addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN Media Access Control\r\n(MAC) addresses), such that the benefits of stable addresses can be\r\nachieved without sacrificing the security and privacy of users.  The\r\nmethod specified in this document applies to all prefixes a host may\r\nbe employing, including link-local, global, and unique-local prefixes\r\n(and their corresponding addresses).","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7217","errata_url":null}
