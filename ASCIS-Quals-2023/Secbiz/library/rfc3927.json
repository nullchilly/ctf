Unfortunately,\r\nsuch address configuration information may not always be available.\r\nIt is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful\r\nsubset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration\r\nis available.  This document describes how a host may automatically\r\nconfigure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254\/16\r\nprefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to\r\nthe same physical (or logical) link.\r\n\r\nIPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with\r\ndevices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical)\r\nlink, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not\r\navailable (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks).  This document\r\ndoes not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable\r\naddresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface.
