Westerlund"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"22","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Multiparty Multimedia Session Control RAI","abstract":"This document defines a Session Description Protocol (SDP) Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth modifier that does not include transport overhead; instead an additional packet rate attribute is defined.  The transport independent bit-rate value together with the maximum packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bit-rate over the transport actually used. \r\n\r\n The existing SDP bandwidth modifiers and their values include the bandwidth needed for the transport and IP layers.  When using SDP with protocols like the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), and when the involved hosts has different transport overhead, for example due to different IP versions, the interpretation of what lower layer bandwidths are included is not clear.
