While many mechanisms have been\r\ndesigned to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the\r\npassage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet\r\n\"lost\". Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism\r\nrepresents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore,\r\nno implementation suits all situations.  This document provides\r\nhigh-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for\r\ngeneral use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the\r\nrequirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars\r\nthat best address each situation.","pub_date":"November 2020","keywords":["retransmission timeout","packet loss","loss detection","requirements"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0233"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8961","errata_url":null}
