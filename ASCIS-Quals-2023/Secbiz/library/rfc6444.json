To determine the PSAP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), the\r\nusage of the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is\r\nenvisioned.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a problem statement and lists requirements for\r\nsituations where the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and\/or the\r\nInternet Service Provider (ISP) are only willing to disclose limited\r\nor no location information.
