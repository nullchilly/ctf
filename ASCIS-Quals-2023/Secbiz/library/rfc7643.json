The specification suite builds upon experience\r\nwith existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on\r\nsimplicity of development and integration, while applying existing\r\nauthentication, authorization, and privacy models.  Its intent is to\r\nreduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by\r\nproviding a common user schema and extension model as well as binding\r\ndocuments to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a platform-neutral schema and extension model\r\nfor representing users and groups and other resource types in JSON\r\nformat.  This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud\r\nservice providers.","pub_date":"September 2015","keywords":["Identity","Provisioning","User","Group"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7643","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7643"}
