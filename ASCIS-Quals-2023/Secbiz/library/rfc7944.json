This document addresses this by\r\ndefining a mechanism to allow Diameter endpoints to indicate the\r\nrelative priority of Diameter transactions.  With this information,\r\nDiameter nodes can factor that priority into routing, resource\r\nallocation, and overload abatement decisions.","pub_date":"August 2016","keywords":["Diameter","Overload"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7944","errata_url":null}
