The aim is to\r\nfacilitate interworking of GMPLS-capable Label Switching Routers\r\n(LSRs).  The document is based on experience gained in implementation,\r\ninteroperability testing, and deployment.\r\n\r\nThe document describes how to interpret address and identifier fields\r\nwithin GMPLS protocols, and how to choose which addresses to set in\r\nthose fields for specific control plane usage models.  It also\r\ndiscusses how to handle IPv6 sources and destinations in the MPLS and\r\nGMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Management Information Base (MIB)\r\nmodules.\r\n\r\nThis document does not define new procedures or processes.  Whenever\r\nthis document makes requirements statements or recommendations, these\r\nare taken from normative text in the referenced RFCs.
