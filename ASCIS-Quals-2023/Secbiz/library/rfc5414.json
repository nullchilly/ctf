It has also\r\ntranslated into an increasing scale of the WLANs.  Large-scale\r\ndeployments made of large numbers of wireless termination points\r\n(WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common.\r\n\r\nThe Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) described in this document\r\nallows for the control and provisioning of large-scale WLANs.  It\r\nenables central management of these networks and realizes the\r\nobjectives set forth for the Control And Provisioning of Wireless\r\nAccess Points (CAPWAP).  This document defines a Historic Document for \r\nthe Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2010","keywords":["wlan","wireless local area network","twp","wireless termination points","capwap","control and provisioning of wireless access points"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC5415"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5414","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5414"}
