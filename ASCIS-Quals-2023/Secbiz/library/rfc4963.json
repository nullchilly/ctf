At high data rates, the 16-bit IP\r\nidentification field is not large enough to prevent frequent\r\nincorrectly assembled IP fragments, and the TCP and UDP checksums are\r\ninsufficient to prevent the resulting corrupted datagrams from being\r\ndelivered to higher protocol layers.  This note describes some easily\r\nreproduced experiments demonstrating the problem, and discusses some\r\nof the operational implications of these observations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4963","errata_url":null}
