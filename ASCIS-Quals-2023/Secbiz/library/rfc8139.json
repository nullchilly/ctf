Where\r\nmultiple TRILL switches are attached to a link, native traffic to and\r\nfrom end stations on that link is handled by a subset of those TRILL\r\nswitches called \"Appointed Forwarders\" as originally specified in RFC\r\n6325, with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled by\r\nat most one TRILL switch.  This document clarifies and updates the\r\nAppointed Forwarder mechanism.  It updates RFCs 6325 and 7177 and\r\nobsoletes RFC 6439.\r\n","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":["DRB","VLAN mapping","inhibition","port shutdown","trill","TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links"],"obsoletes":["RFC6439"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6325","RFC7177"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8139","errata_url":null}
