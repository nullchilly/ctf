The Internet Key\r\nExchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem\r\nthat could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could\r\ndecrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available. \r\nIt is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support\r\nquantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely\r\nto happen in the near term.  To address this problem before then,\r\nthis document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be\r\nresistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys.","pub_date":"June 2020","keywords":["internet key exchange","quantum computer","post quantum","post-quantum","quantum safe","quantum secure","quantum resistant"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8784","errata_url":null}
