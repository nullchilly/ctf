In this context, it is important to\r\noptimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use\r\nlink aggregation groups and equal-cost multipaths as techniques for\r\nbandwidth scaling.  This document explores some of the mechanisms useful\r\nfor achieving this.","pub_date":"January 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7424","errata_url":null}
