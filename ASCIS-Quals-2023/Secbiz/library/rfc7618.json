Address sharing allows a single IPv4\r\naddress to be allocated to multiple active clients simultaneously,\r\nwith each client being differentiated by a unique set of transport-\r\nlayer source port numbers.  The necessary changes to existing DHCPv4\r\nclient and server behavior are described, and a new DHCPv4 option for\r\nprovisioning clients with shared IPv4 addresses is included.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of IP address sharing, some limitations to its\r\napplicability are necessary.  This memo describes these limitations\r\nand recommends suitable architectures and technologies where address\r\nsharing may be utilized.","pub_date":"August 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7618","errata_url":null}
