Such a\r\nnotification system is being used to provide near-immediate\r\nnotifications to customers, such as to warn them that their traffic\r\nexhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection.\r\nThere are other proprietary systems that can perform such\r\nnotifications, but those systems utilize Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)\r\ntechnology.  In contrast to DPI, this document describes a system\r\nthat does not rely upon DPI, and is instead based in open IETF\r\nstandards and open source applications.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["ISP","Internet Service Provider","bot remediation","bot notification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6108","errata_url":null}
