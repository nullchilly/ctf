PIM-SM is a multicast routing protocol that can use the\r\nunderlying unicast routing information base or a separate\r\nmulticast-capable routing information base.  It builds unidirectional\r\nshared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, and it\r\noptionally creates shortest-path trees per source.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 4601 by replacing it, addresses the\r\nerrata filed against it, removes the optional (*,*,RP), PIM Multicast\r\nBorder Router features and authentication using IPsec that lack\r\nsufficient deployment experience (see Appendix A), and moves the PIM\r\nspecification to Internet Standard.","pub_date":"March 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC4601"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8736","RFC9436"],"see_also":["STD0083"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7761","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7761"}
