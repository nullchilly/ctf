As MAC systems become more widely deployed, additional\r\nflexibility in mechanism and policy will be required.  While\r\ntraditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security (MLS)\r\nand integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include such\r\ntechnologies as type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies\r\nand mechanisms that need to be accommodated, it is unlikely that the\r\nuse of a single security label format and model will be viable.\r\n\r\nTo allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to co-exist in a\r\nnetwork, this document creates a registry of label format\r\nspecifications.  This registry contains label format identifiers and\r\nprovides for the association of each such identifier with a\r\ncorresponding extensive document outlining the exact syntax and use\r\nof the particular label format.","pub_date":"July 2015","keywords":["NFSv4"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7569","errata_url":null}
