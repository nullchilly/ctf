However, RFC 2544 does not address some of the\r\nspecificities of IPv6.  This document provides additional\r\nbenchmarking guidelines, which in conjunction with RFC 2544, lead to a\r\nmore complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance of\r\nnetwork interconnect devices.  IPv6 transition mechanisms are outside\r\nthe scope of this document.  This memo provides information for the \r\nInternet community.","pub_date":"May 2008","keywords":["rfc2544","ipv6","benchmarking guidelines"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5180","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5180"}
