These documents were known as xx00\r\ndocuments, the last of which was published in May 2008.  These\r\nsnapshots have been replaced by a web page, so the RFC Editor\r\nwill no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.  As a result,\r\nthe RFC Editor will classify unpublished RFC xx00 numbers through\r\n7000 as never issued.  Starting with the RFC number 7100, xx00\r\nnumbers will be available for assignment.","pub_date":"December 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7101","errata_url":null}
