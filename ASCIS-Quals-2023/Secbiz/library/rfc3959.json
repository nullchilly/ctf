The treatment of \"early-session\" bodies is similar to the treatment of \"session\" bodies.  That is, they follow the offer\/answer model.  Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is \"early-session\" are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialogs.
