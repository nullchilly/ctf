Context transfers allow better support\r\nfor node based mobility so that the applications running on mobile\r\nnodes can operate with minimal disruption.  Key objectives are to\r\nreduce latency and packet losses, and to avoid the re-initiation of signaling\r\nto and from the mobile node.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"June 2005","keywords":["mobile node","mn"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4067","errata_url":null}
