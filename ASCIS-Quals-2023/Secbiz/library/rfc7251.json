The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact\r\nimplementations, making it suitable for constrained environments,\r\nwhile at the same time providing a high level of security.  The\r\ncipher suites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve\r\nCryptography (ECC) and are advantageous in networks with limited\r\nbandwidth.","pub_date":"June 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7251","errata_url":null}
