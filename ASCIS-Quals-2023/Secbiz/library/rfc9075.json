These behavior\r\nchanges drove changes in Internet traffic.\r\n\r\nThe Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss\r\nnetwork impacts of the pandemic on November 9-13, 2020. The workshop\r\nwas held to convene interested researchers, network operators,\r\nnetwork management experts, and Internet technologists to share their\r\nexperiences. The meeting was held online given the ongoing travel and\r\ncontact restrictions at that time.\r\n\r\nNote that this document is a report on the proceedings of the\r\nworkshop.
