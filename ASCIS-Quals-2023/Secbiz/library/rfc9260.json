It incorporates the specification of\r\nthe chunk flags registry from RFC 6096 and the specification of the I\r\nbit of DATA chunks from RFC 7053. Therefore, RFCs 6096 and 7053 are\r\nalso obsoleted by this document. In addition, RFCs 4460 and 8540,\r\nwhich describe errata for SCTP, are obsoleted by this document. \r\n\r\nSCTP was originally designed to transport Public Switched Telephone\r\nNetwork (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks. It is also suited\r\nto be used for other applications, for example, WebRTC.\r\n\r\nSCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of a\r\nconnectionless packet network, such as IP. It offers the following\r\nservices to its users:\r\n\r\nThe design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance behavior\r\nand resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks.","pub_date":"June 2022","keywords":["SCTP","IP","internet","transport","packet","network"],"obsoletes":["RFC4460","RFC4960","RFC6096","RFC7053","RFC8540"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9260","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9260"}
