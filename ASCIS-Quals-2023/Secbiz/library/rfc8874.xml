      <t pn="section-1-1">The IETF has an open and transparent process for developing standards.  The use
of <eref target="https://github.com/" brackets="none">GitHub</eref> or similar tools, when used as part of this process,
can have several objectives.  GitHub provides tools that can be helpful in editing documents.
Use of this service has been found to reduce the time that a working group needs
to produce documents and to improve the quality of the final result.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-2">The use of version control improves the traceability and visibility
      of changes.  Issue tracking can be used to manage open issues and
      provide a record of their resolution.  Pull requests allow for better
      engagement on technical and editorial changes, and encourage
      contributions from a larger set of contributors.  Using GitHub can also
      broaden the community of contributors for a specification.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-3">The main purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for how a
      working group might integrate the capabilities provided by GitHub into
      their processes for developing Internet-Drafts. Whether to use GitHub
      and whether to adopt these practices is left to the discretion of the
      working group.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-4">This document is meant as a supplement to existing working group
      practices.  It provides guidance to working group chairs and
      participants on how they can best use GitHub within the framework
      established by RFC 2418 <xref target="RFC2418" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2418"/>.  This
      document aims to establish norms that reduce the variation in usage
      patterns between different working groups and to help avoid issues that
      have been encountered in the past.</t>
      <t pn="section-1-5">A companion document, <xref target="RFC8875" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8875"/>,
describes administrative processes that support the practices described in this

      <t pn="section-1-6">Although the operation of IRTF research groups can be similar in
      function to working groups, this document only directly addresses the
      needs of working groups.  However, other groups may draw inspiration for
      GitHub use from the contents herein.</t>

        GitHub to their work.  The intent is to allow each working group
        considerable flexibility in how they use GitHub.</t>
        <t pn="section-1.4-2">This document requires that policies for use of GitHub are agreed
        upon and clearly communicated within the working group (see <xref target="policy" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>).  The remainder of the document
        contains guidelines and advice on how to construct a workable
        policy.</t>
        <t pn="section-1.4-3">The requirements here apply to the case where a working group
        decides to use GitHub as a primary means of interaction.  Individuals
        can set their own policies when using GitHub for managing their own
        drafts or for managing drafts that they edit on behalf of a working
        group that has not explicitly adopted GitHub.</t>
        <t pn="section-1.4-4">For both sets of users, this document aims to provide some amount
        of advice on practices that have been effective.</t>
        <t pn="section-1.4-5">This document only aims to address use of GitHub in developing
        documents.  A working group could choose to use the tool to aid in
        managing their charter or session materials such as agendas, minutes,
        and presentations.  Though the advice here might apply more broadly,
        using GitHub to manage other material is out of scope for this

        remind new contributors of these guidelines.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-3">Working group chairs are responsible for ensuring that any policy
        they adopt is enforced and maintained.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-4">The set of GitHub features (<xref target="features" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>) that the working group relies upon need to be

        on potential policies and how those might be applied.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-5">Features that the working group does not rely upon can be made
        available to document editors.  Editors are then able to use these
        features for their own purposes.  For example, though the working
        group might not formally use issues to track items that require
        further discussion in order to reach consensus, keeping the issue
        tracker available to editors can be valuable.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-6">Working group policies need to be set with the goal of improving
        transparency, participation, and ultimately the quality of documents.
        At times, it might be appropriate to impose some limitations on what
        document editors are able to do in order to serve these goals.  Chairs
        are encouraged to periodically consult with document editors to ensure

        IETF Note Well and bear notices; see <xref target="notices" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2.2"/>.  This recognizes that editors have traditionally
        chosen their own methods for managing the documents they edit but
        preserves the need for contributors to understand their obligations
        with respect to IETF processes.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.1-8">Work done in GitHub has no special status.  The output of any

        organization at the discretion of the chairs.  Chairs could decide to
        only create new repositories for adopted working group items, or they
        might create repositories for individual documents on request.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.2-2">Maintaining private repositories for working group products is not
        recommended without specific cause.  For instance, a document that
        details a security vulnerability might be kept private prior to its
        initial publication as an Internet-Draft. Once an Internet-Draft is
        published, repositories for working group documents
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be made public.</t>
        <t pn="section-3.2-3">The adoption status of any document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be clear
        from the contents of the repository.  This can be achieved by having
        the name of the document reflect status (that is,
        draft-ietf-&lt;wgname&gt;-... indicates that the document was
        adopted) or through a prominent notice (such as in the README).</t>
        <t pn="section-3.2-4">Experience has shown that maintaining separate repositories for
        independent documents is most manageable.  This allows the work in

        single milestone, might be placed in a single repository.  This allows

        <t pn="section-3.2-6">Maintaining multiple documents in the same repository can add

repository.  A user does not need to have write access to a repository to create
a pull request.  A user can create a "fork", or copy, of any public repository.
The user has write access to their own fork, allowing them to make local
changes.  A pull request asks the owner of a repository to merge a specific set
of changes from a fork (or any branch) into their copy.</t>

        discussion on what constitutes a substantial change. A pull request
        creates an artifact that records the reasons for changes and provides

      approaches to greater use of the tool in working groups.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-2">This section describes some basic modes for interacting with GitHub,
      each progressively more involved. This starts with a very lightweight
      interaction where document management is the only feature that is
      formally used; then, progressively more intensive use of the GitHub issue
      tracking capabilities is described.  These approaches differ primarily
      in how discussion of substantive matters is managed.  Most of the advice
      in this document applies equally to all models.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-3">Working groups can adjust these policies to suit their needs but
      are advised to avoid gratuitous changes for the sake of consistency
      across the IETF as a whole.  It is possible to use different processes
      for different documents in the working group.</t>
      <t pn="section-5-4">Working group chairs are responsible for confirming that the working
      group has consensus to adopt any process.  In particular, the
      introduction of a more tightly controlled process can have the effect of
      privileging positions already captured in documents, which might
      disadvantage alternative viewpoints.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-document-management-mode">Document Management Mode</name>
        <t pn="section-5.1-1">In this mode of interaction, GitHub repositories are used to manage
        changes to documents, but the bulk of the work is conducted using
        email, face-to-face meetings, and other more traditional interactions.
        The intent of this policy is to enable document and issue management
        using GitHub while minimizing the complexity of the process.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.1-2">In the version of this mode with the least interaction with GitHub,
        a repository is created for the purposes of document management by
        editors.  Editors might maintain issues and pull requests for their
        own benefit, but these have no formal standing in the working group
        process.</t>

        <t pn="section-5.2-1">In addition to managing documents, the working group might choose
        to use GitHub for tracking outstanding issues.  In this mode of
        interaction, a record of the existence of substantive technical
        discussions is tracked using issues in the issue tracker.  However,
        discussion of any substantial matters is always conducted on mailing
        lists.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.2-2">Under this mode, issues and pull requests can be opened by anyone,
        but anything deemed substantive <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be resolved
        exclusively on the mailing list.  Discussion on GitHub is limited to
        recording the state of issues.  Only editorial matters can be resolved
        using the issue tracker.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.2-3">Chairs and editors are given discretion in determining what issues
        are substantive.  As documents mature, it is generally prudent to
        prefer consulting the mailing list where there is doubt.  As with
        other working group decisions, chairs are the arbiters in case of
        dispute.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.2-4">A recurrent problem with this mode of interaction is the tendency
        for discussions to spontaneously develop in the issue tracker.  This
        requires a degree of discipline from chairs and editors to ensure that
        any substantive matters are taken to the mailing list.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.2-5">Retaining mailing lists as the primary venue for discussion of
        substantive matters ensures that this mode, along with the document
        management mode, is most compatible with existing work practices for
        working groups.  Participants in a working group that operates under
        either model can reasonably be expected to receive all relevant
        communication about the work of the group from the working group
        mailing list.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.2-6">Though the mailing list is used for making decisions, the issue
        tracker can still be a useful record of the state of issues.  It is
        often useful if chairs or editors record details of decisions in issue
        comments when closing issues as resolved.</t>

        <t pn="section-5.3-1">This GitHub interaction mode differs from the other modes in that
        discussion relating to substantive technical matters is allowed to
        occur on GitHub issues.  Though decisions are always subject to
        confirmation on the mailing list, participants are permitted to
        conduct substantive discussions on the issue tracker.  In some cases,
        this can include making some decisions without involving the working
        group mailing list.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.3-2">A working group mailing list remains a critical venue for decision
        making, even where issue discussion occurs elsewhere.  Working group
        mailing lists generally include a wider audience than those who follow
        issue discussion, so difficult issues always benefit from list
        discussion.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.3-3">Decisions about working group consensus <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always
        be confirmed using the working group mailing list.  However, depending
        on the maturity of documents, this might be a more lightweight
        interaction such as sending an email confirmation for an initial set
        of resolutions arising from discussions on the issue tracker.</t>
        <t pn="section-5.3-4">Using the mailing list to resolve difficult or controversial issues
        is strongly encouraged.  In those cases, the issue tracker might be
        used to more fully develop an understanding of problems before
        initiating a discussion on the mailing list, along lines similar to
        the design team process (see <xref target="RFC2418" sectionFormat="of" section="6.5" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-6.5" derivedContent="RFC2418"/>).</t>

          and resolve technical issues, including making any changes that
          editors feel necessary.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.3.1-2">
The primary reason to grant editors more discretionary power is to improve the
speed with which changes can be made.  In many cases, documents that are
adopted by a working group are already sufficiently mature, and a looser
process is not beneficial. A looser process increases the risk of missing
issues that need working group consensus and integrating substantive changes
based on decisions that don't reflect the consensus of the working group. 
</t>
          <t pn="section-5.3.1-3">Changes made by editors under this process do not lack options
          for identifying and correcting problems.  GitHub and Git provide
          tools for ensuring that changes are tracked and can be audited.
          Within the usual working group process, it is expected that
          Internet-Drafts will receive regular review. Also, process
          checkpoints like Working Group Last Call (WGLC; <xref target="RFC2418" sectionFormat="of" section="7.4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-7.4" derivedContent="RFC2418"/>) provide
          additional safeguards against abuse.</t>
          <t pn="section-5.3.1-4">Working groups are advised against allowing editors this degree
          of flexibility for the entirety of a document life cycle.  Once a
          document is more stable and mature, it could be useful to move to a
          more tightly controlled process.</t>

          <t pn="section-5.3.2-2">Chairs <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to manage the process of

          <t pn="section-5.3.2-5">More mature documents require not only consensus, but consensus

      process, but the ultimate decision on consensus regarding a document is
      made by the chairs <xref target="RFC2026" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2026"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-2">GitHub facilitates more involved interactions, which can result in a
      much higher level of activity than a typical working group mailing list.
      Participants who wish to limit their time commitment might follow GitHub
      activity selectively, either by following only specific issues or by
      occasionally reviewing the state of the document.  Other participants
      might not use GitHub at all.  Chairs are reminded that assessing
      consensus based on GitHub content alone cannot be assumed to reach all
      interested participants.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-3">As described in <xref target="RFC2418" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2418"/>, chairs
      consider input from all discussion venues when assessing
      consensus. These include mailing lists, IETF meetings, and interim
      meetings in addition to discussion on GitHub. Each venue has different
      selection biases that might need to be considered.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-4">A working group chair <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consult the working group
      mailing list for any issue that is potentially contentious.  Relying on
      input provided through GitHub alone might result in gaining input from a
      narrower set of participants.  This includes important milestones like
      Working Group Last Call, where review from the widest possible audience
      ensures a higher quality document.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-5">If permitted, GitHub will be used for technical discussion and
      decisions, especially during early stages of development of a document.
      Any decisions are confirmed through review within the working group and,
      ultimately, through Working Group Last Call; see <xref target="RFC2418" sectionFormat="of" section="7.4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-7.4" derivedContent="RFC2418"/>.</t>
      <t pn="section-7-6">The use of issues and labels has been effective in managing

      work when changes are made to a repository.</t>
      <t pn="section-8-2">One common practice is to use these continuous integration services
      to build a text or HTML version of a document.  This is then published
      to GitHub Pages, which allows users to view a version of the most recent
      revision of a document.  Including a prominent link to this version of
      the document (such as in the README) makes it easier for new
      contributors to find a readable copy of the most recent version of a
      draft.  In addition, including links to differences between this
      generated version and any published document helps contributors identify
      recent changes.</t>
      <t pn="section-8-3">Continuous integration can also validate pull requests and other
      changes for errors.  The most basic check is whether the source
      file can be transformed successfully into a valid Internet-Draft.  For
      example, this might include checking that the XML source is syntactically
      correct.</t>
      <t pn="section-8-4">For a document that uses formal languages as part of the
      specification, such as schema or source code, a continuous integration
      system might also be used to validate any formal language that the
      document contains.  Tests for any source code that the document contains
      might be run, or examples might be checked for correctness.</t>

a few additional tasks can greatly improve the process for the working group.</t>
      <t pn="section-9-2">Using GitHub means that it is more likely that a contribution is made by users
who are not very familiar with the work.  Pull requests from new contributors can
contain errors or omissions.  Duplicate issues are commonplace.  Proposed
changes might have grammatical errors or they might diverge from existing style.
If a change is generally sound, rather than rejecting the pull request or
requesting changes, editors could instead accept the change and then make any
necessary corrections.</t>
      <t pn="section-9-3">Editors <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> close a pull request or issue without first understanding why
the item was created.  Editors and chairs <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> try to explain every action
clearly and concisely.  Even if a contributor seems rude, being courteous in response is
always best.</t>
      <t pn="section-9-4">If a contributor makes a comment that raises a new issue, editors can
      create an issue or, if there is an obvious solution, a pull request.
      It does not matter what venue the issue was raised in (e.g., email,
      issue discussion, a pull request review); capturing issues quickly
      ensures that problems become visible and can be tracked.</t>
      <t pn="section-9-5">This takes a little more effort, but these simple steps can help encourage
contributions, which will ultimately improve the quality of documents.</t>

      dependency on an external service.  If GitHub were to fail in some way,
      anyone relying upon its services would be seriously affected.</t>
      <t pn="section-10-2">Widespread use of Git reduces the exposure to a system failure because the
primary repository is replicated in multiple locations.  This includes hosted
web pages; the content of web pages is maintained as a branch in the main
repository.</t>
      <t pn="section-10-3">However, other information maintained on GitHub is more vulnerable to
      loss.  This includes issues and discussion on those issues, discussion
      and reviews of commits and pull requests, and any content hosted on the
      wiki.  Tools exist for extracting this information for backup.</t>
      <t pn="section-10-4">As specified in <xref target="RFC8875" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8875"/>, backup copies of repositories and other important

      <t pn="section-10-5">The potential for malicious actions by compromised or malcontent
       editors, chairs, and area directors is relevant in maintaining the
       integrity of the content that GitHub hosts.  Backups allow for recovery
       of content, and regular submissions as Internet-Drafts ensure that work
       is not lost completely.</t>
      <t pn="section-10-6">A compromise of GitHub does not pose a significant threat to
       working group operations as it is expected that most data, aside from
       individual credentials, is made public.</t>
