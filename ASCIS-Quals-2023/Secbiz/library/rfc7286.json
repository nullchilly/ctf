ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an\r\nALTO client can ask for guidance, it needs to discover one or more\r\nALTO servers.\r\n\r\nThis document specifies a procedure for resource-consumer-initiated\r\nALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is\r\nembedded in the resource consumer.","pub_date":"November 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7286","errata_url":null}
