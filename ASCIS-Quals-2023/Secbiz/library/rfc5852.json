The ability\r\nof transforming an existing PC into an SPC and vice versa -- without\r\nactually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it -- is a\r\nrequirement.  The requirements for the conversion between permanent\r\nconnections and switched connections in a GMPLS Network are defined\r\nin RFC 5493.\r\n\r\nThis memo describes an extension to GMPLS Resource Reservation\r\nProtocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling that enables the\r\ntransfer of connection ownership between the Management and the\r\nControl Planes.  Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover.  This\r\ndocument defines all Handover-related procedures.  This includes the\r\nhandling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original\r\nstate.  A basic premise of the extension is that the Handover\r\nprocedures must never impact an already established Data Plane\r\nconnection.
