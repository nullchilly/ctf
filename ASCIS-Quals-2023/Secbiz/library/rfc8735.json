While there are\r\nvarious technology solutions, there is no single solution that can\r\nfulfill these requirements for a native IP network. In particular,\r\nthere is a need for a universal E2E solution that can cover both\r\nintra- and inter-domain scenarios.\r\n\r\nOne feasible E2E traffic-engineering solution is the addition of\r\ncentral control in a native IP network. This document describes\r\nvarious complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the\r\nPath Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network. This solution,\r\nreferred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates\r\nthe advantage of using distributed protocols and the power of a\r\ncentralized control technology, providing traffic engineering for\r\nnative IP networks in a manner that applies equally to intra- and\r\ninter-domain scenarios.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["CCDR","Traffic Engineering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8735","errata_url":null}
