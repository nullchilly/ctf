One such environment is the IPv6\r\nhome network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have\r\nit automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document\r\ndescribes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring.\r\nThis document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing the HelloInterval\/\r\nRouterDeadInterval checking during OSPFv3 adjacency formation and\r\nadding hysteresis to the update of self-originated Link State\r\nAdvertisements (LSAs).","pub_date":"April 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC5340"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7503","errata_url":null}
