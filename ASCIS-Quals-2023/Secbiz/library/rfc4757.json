This is offered as an alternative to using\r\nthe existing DES-based encryption types.\r\n\r\nThe RC4-HMAC encryption types are used to ease upgrade of existing\r\nWindows NT environments, provide strong cryptography (128-bit key lengths),\r\nand provide exportable (meet United States government export\r\nrestriction requirements) encryption.  This document describes the\r\nimplementation of those encryption types.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"December 2006","keywords":["md5 hmac"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC6649"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4757","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc4757"}
