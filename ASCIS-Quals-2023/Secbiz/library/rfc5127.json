However, some\r\nnetwork segments may be configured in such a way that a single\r\nforwarding treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and\r\nperformance requirements of two or more service classes.  In these\r\ncases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more Diffserv service\r\nclasses into a single forwarding treatment.  This document provides\r\nguidelines for the aggregation of Diffserv service classes into\r\nforwarding treatments.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"February 2008","keywords":["Treatment Aggregate","forwarding treatment"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5127","errata_url":null}
