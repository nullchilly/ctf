The\r\nmodule reflects the \"tunnelType\" registry maintained by IANA. The\r\nlatest revision of this YANG module can be obtained from the IANA\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\nTunnel type values are not directly added to the Tunnel Interface\r\nTypes YANG module; they must instead be added to the \"tunnelType\"\r\nIANA registry. Once a new tunnel type registration is made by IANA\r\nfor a new tunneling scheme or even an existing one that is not\r\nalready listed in the current registry (e.g., LISP, NSH), IANA will\r\nupdate the Tunnel Interface Types YANG module accordingly.\r\n\r\nSome of the IETF-defined tunneling techniques are not listed in the\r\ncurrent IANA registry. It is not the intent of this document to\r\nupdate the existing IANA registry with a comprehensive list of tunnel\r\ntechnologies. Registrants must follow the IETF registration procedure\r\nfor interface types whenever a new tunnel type is needed.","pub_date":"November 2019","keywords":["softwire","Augment tunnel","tunnel management","tunnel provisioning","tunnel activation","tunnel automation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8675","errata_url":null}
