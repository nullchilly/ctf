As services rely upon\r\nmultiple subservices provided by a variety of elements, including the\r\nunderlying network devices and functions, getting the assurance of a\r\nhealthy service is only possible with a holistic view of all involved\r\nelements. This architecture not only helps to correlate the service\r\ndegradation with symptoms of a specific network component but, it\r\nalso lists the services impacted by the failure or degradation of a\r\nspecific network component.","pub_date":"July 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9417","errata_url":null}
