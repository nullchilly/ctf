In\r\ncertain circumstances, a client or a server might feel that they will\r\nbe compelled in the future to share their keys with a third party.\r\nSome clients and servers also have been compelled to share their\r\nkeys and wish to indicate to relying parties upon certificate\r\nrenewal that their keys have in fact been shared with a third\r\nparty.","pub_date":"1 April 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7169","errata_url":null}
