This specification extends the submission\r\nprofile by adding a new BURL command that can be used to fetch\r\nsubmission data from an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)\r\nserver.  This permits a mail client to inject content from an IMAP\r\nserver into the SMTP infrastructure without downloading it to the\r\nclient and uploading it back to the server.
