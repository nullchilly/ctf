In addition, the same mobility option can be used to\r\nnegotiate the GRE encapsulation mode without exchanging the GRE keys.\r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"June 2010","keywords":["[--------]","PMIP6","PMIPv6","Downlink GRE Key","Uplink GRE Key","TLV-Header Tunneling","TLV-Header Tunneling","GRE Key Exchange"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5845","errata_url":null}
