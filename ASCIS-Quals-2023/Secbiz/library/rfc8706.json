This allows the neighbors to\r\nmaintain their adjacencies until the router has restarted but also\r\nallows the neighbors to bring the adjacencies down in the event of\r\nother topology changes.\r\n\r\nThis document additionally describes a mechanism for a restarting\r\nrouter to determine when it has achieved Link State Protocol Data\r\nUnit (LSP) database synchronization with its neighbors and a\r\nmechanism to optimize LSP database synchronization while minimizing\r\ntransient routing disruption when a router starts.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 5306.","pub_date":"February 2020","keywords":["IGP","graceful restart"],"obsoletes":["RFC5306"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8706","errata_url":null}
