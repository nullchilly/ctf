Based on the DAD signaling, the\r\nfirst-hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses\r\nused on a point-to-multipoint domain (e.g., VLAN).  When a node\r\nperforms DAD for an address already used by another node, the\r\nfirst-hop router defends the address rather than the device using the\r\naddress.","pub_date":"June 2013","keywords":["IPv6","SLAAC","DAD","SAVI"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6957","errata_url":null}
