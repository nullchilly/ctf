The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This\r\nmemo is one of a series describing possible boundary-node behaviors\r\nfor a PCN-domain.  The behavior described here is that for a form of\r\nmeasurement-based load control using three PCN marking states: not-\r\nmarked, threshold-marked, and excess-traffic-marked.  This behavior\r\nis known informally as the Controlled Load (CL) PCN-boundary-node\r\nbehavior.
