The target audience is zone\r\nadministrators deploying DNSSEC.\r\n\r\nThe document discusses operational aspects of using keys and\r\nsignatures in the DNS.  It discusses issues of key generation, key\r\nstorage, signature generation, key rollover, and related policies.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2541, as it covers more operational\r\nground and gives more up-to-date requirements with respect to key\r\nsizes and the new DNSSEC specification.
