With PIM proxying, PEs do not flood PIM\r\nJoin\/Prune messages but only generate their own and send them out of\r\ncertain ports, based on the control states built from downstream\r\nJoin\/Prune messages.  PIM proxying is required when PIM Join\r\nsuppression is enabled on the Customer Edge (CE) devices and is\r\nuseful for reducing PIM control traffic in a VPLS domain.\r\n\r\nThis document also describes PIM relay, which can be viewed as\r\nlightweight proxying, where all downstream Join\/Prune messages are\r\nsimply forwarded out of certain ports and are not flooded, thereby\r\navoiding the triggering of PIM Join suppression on CE devices.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8220","errata_url":null}
