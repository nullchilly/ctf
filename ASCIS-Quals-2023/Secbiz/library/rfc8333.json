This mechanism proposes a two-step convergence by\r\nintroducing a delay between the convergence of the node adjacent to\r\nthe topology change and the network-wide convergence.\r\n\r\nBecause this mechanism delays the IGP convergence, it may only be\r\nused for planned maintenance or when Fast Reroute (FRR) protects the\r\ntraffic during the time between the link failure and the IGP\r\nconvergence.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is limited to the link-down event in order to keep the\r\nmechanism simple.\r\n\r\nSimulations using real network topologies have been performed and\r\nshow that local loops are a significant portion (>50%) of the total\r\nforwarding loops.","pub_date":"March 2018","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8333","errata_url":null}
