This includes, but\r\nis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications.  The goal\r\nof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide\r\nguidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts\r\nfrom a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.\r\nThis memo discusses deployment-related issues of ALTO.  It addresses\r\ndifferent use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file sharing and\r\nContent Delivery Networks (CDNs) and presents corresponding examples.\r\nThe document also includes recommendations for network administrators\r\nand application designers planning to deploy ALTO, such as\r\nrecommendations on how to generate ALTO map information.","pub_date":"October 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7971","errata_url":null}
