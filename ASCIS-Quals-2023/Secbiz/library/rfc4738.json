In the public-key mode, the Initiator\r\nencrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and sends it to\r\nthe Responder.  In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may\r\nnot know the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's\r\nID (e.g., call forwarding) in advance.  We propose a new MIKEY mode\r\nthat works well in such scenarios.  This mode also enhances the group\r\nkey management support in MIKEY; it supports member-initiated group\r\nkey download (in contrast to group manager pushing the group keys to\r\nall members).  This document updates RFC 3830 with the RSA-R mode.
