The payload\r\nformat is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and\r\nAMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition, a file\r\nformat is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in\r\nstorage mode applications such as email.  Two separate media type\r\nregistrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB,\r\nspecifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage\r\nformat.  This document obsoletes RFC 3267.
