Key chains\r\nare commonly used for routing protocol authentication and other\r\napplications requiring symmetric keys.  A key chain is a list\r\ncontaining one or more elements containing a Key ID, key string,\r\nsend\/accept lifetimes, and the associated authentication or\r\nencryption algorithm.  By properly overlapping the send and accept\r\nlifetimes of multiple key chain elements, key strings and algorithms\r\nmay be gracefully updated.  By representing them in a YANG data\r\nmodel, key distribution can be automated.","pub_date":"June 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8177","errata_url":null}
