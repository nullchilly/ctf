Internet users with infected computers are exposed to\r\nrisks such as loss of personal data and increased susceptibility to\r\nonline fraud.  Such computers can also become inadvertent\r\nparticipants in or components of an online crime network, spam\r\nnetwork, and\/or phishing network as well as be used as a part of a\r\ndistributed denial-of-service attack.  Mitigating the effects of and\r\nremediating the installations of malicious bots will make it more\r\ndifficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online\r\ncrime on the Internet in general and\/or on a particular Internet\r\nService Provider's network.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"March 2012","keywords":["ISP","Internet Service Provider","Bot","Botnet","Remediation","malware","notification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6561","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6561"}
