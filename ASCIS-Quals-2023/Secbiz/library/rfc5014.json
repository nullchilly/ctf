This document fills\r\nthat gap partially by specifying new socket-level options for source\r\naddress selection and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify\r\naddress selection based on the source address preference in\r\naccordance with the socket-level options that modify the default\r\nsource address selection algorithm.  The socket API described in this\r\ndocument will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want\r\nto choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6\r\naware applications that want to use the care-of address for\r\ncommunication.  It also specifies socket options and flags for\r\nselecting Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) or non-CGA source\r\naddresses.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2007","keywords":["getaddrinfo()cga","cryptographically generated address"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5014","errata_url":null}
