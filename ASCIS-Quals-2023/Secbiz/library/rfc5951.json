The requirements are defined for specification of\r\nnetwork management aspects of protocol mechanisms and procedures\r\nthat constitute the building blocks out of which the MPLS\r\nTransport Profile is constructed.  That is, these requirements\r\nindicate what management capabilities need to be available in\r\nMPLS for use in managing the MPLS-TP.  This document is intended\r\nto identify essential network management capabilities, not to\r\nspecify what functions any particular MPLS implementation\r\nsupports.
