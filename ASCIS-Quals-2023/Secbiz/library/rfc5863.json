The organization can be the author's, the\r\noriginating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents.  A\r\nmessage can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different\r\norganizations involved with the message.  DKIM defines a domain-level\r\ndigital signature authentication framework for email, using public\r\nkey cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server\r\ntechnology.  This permits verification of a responsible organization,\r\nas well as the integrity of the message content.  DKIM will also\r\nprovide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish\r\ninformation about their email signing practices; this will permit\r\nemail receivers to make additional assessments about messages.\r\nDKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global\r\ncontrol of \"spam\" and \"phishing\".  This document provides\r\nimplementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations\r\nfor DKIM.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track \r\nspecification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"May 2010","keywords":["Email","Electronic Mail","Internet Mail","Message Verification"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5863","errata_url":null}
