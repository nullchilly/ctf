The first model\r\nstatistically characterizes the behavior of a live video encoder in\r\nresponse to changing requests on the target video rate.  The second\r\nmodel is trace-driven and emulates the output of actual encoded video\r\nframe sizes from a high-resolution test sequence.  Both models are\r\ndesigned to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and\r\nauthenticity in modeling the interactions between a live video\r\ntraffic source and the congestion control module.  Finally, the\r\ndocument describes how both approaches can be combined into a hybrid\r\nmodel.","pub_date":"May 2019","keywords":["Multimedia","Congestion Control"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8593","errata_url":null}
