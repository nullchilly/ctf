This\r\nmeans that B2BUAs often implement an RTP or RTP Control Protocol\r\n(RTCP) stack as well, thus leading to separate multimedia sessions\r\nthat the B2BUA correlates and bridges together.  If not disciplined,\r\nthis behaviour can severely impact the communication experience,\r\nespecially when statistics and feedback information contained in RTCP\r\nmessages get lost because of mismatches in the reported data.\r\n\r\nThis document defines the proper behaviour B2BUAs should follow when\r\nacting on both the signalling plane and media plane in order to\r\npreserve the end-to-end functionality of RTCP.","pub_date":"February 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8079","errata_url":null}
