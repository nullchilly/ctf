As the\r\nscope of Internet mail expands to support more diverse media (such as\r\nvoice mail) and devices (such as cell phones) and to provide rich\r\ninteractions with other services (such as web portals and legal\r\ncompliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification\r\nsystem increases.  This document attempts to enumerate the types of\r\nevents that interest real-world consumers of such a system.\r\n\r\nThis document describes events and event parameters that are useful\r\nfor several cases, including notification to administrative systems\r\nand end users.  This is not intended as a replacement for a message\r\naccess facility such as IMAP.
