The GMPLS control plane\r\n(routing and signaling) uses TE links for establishing Label\r\nSwitched Paths (LSPs).  This memo describes the relationship of the\r\nLMP procedures to 'discovery' as defined in the International\r\nTelecommunication Union (ITU-T), and ongoing ITU-T work.  This\r\ndocument provides an overview of LMP in the context of the ITU-T\r\nAutomatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) and transport network\r\nterminology and relates it to the ITU-T discovery work to promote a\r\ncommon understanding for progressing the work of IETF and ITU-T.
