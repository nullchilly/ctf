CGN port assignments\r\nare often per connection, but they could optionally use port ranges.\r\nResearch indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in\r\nmany residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to\r\nmanage CGN translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the\r\namount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse\r\nresponse.  IPv6 is, of course, the preferred solution.  While\r\ndeployment is in progress, SPs are forced by business imperatives to\r\nmaintain support for IPv4.  This note addresses the IPv4 part of the\r\nnetwork when a CGN solution is in use.","pub_date":"December 2014","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7422","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7422"}
