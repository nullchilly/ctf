Huitema"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"53","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or\r\nmore IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6\r\nconnectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo\r\nservice.  Running the service requires the help of \"Teredo servers\" and\r\n\"Teredo relays\".  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to\r\nmanage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the\r\nTeredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the\r\n\"native\" IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability\r\nwith hosts using other transition mechanisms such as \"6to4\".
