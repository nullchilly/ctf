This document defines RADIUS over the Transmission\r\nControl Protocol (RADIUS\/TCP), in order to address handling issues\r\nrelated to RADIUS over Transport Layer Security (RADIUS\/TLS).  It\r\npermits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for RADIUS only when a\r\ntransport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides confidentiality and\r\nsecurity.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"May 2012","keywords":["Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server","Transmission Control Protocol","RADIUS\/TCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC7930"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6613","errata_url":null}
