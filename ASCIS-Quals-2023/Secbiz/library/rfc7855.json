Source-based routing\r\nmechanisms have previously been specified for network protocols but\r\nhave not seen widespread adoption.  In this context, the term\r\n\"source\" means \"the point at which the explicit route is imposed\";\r\ntherefore, it is not limited to the originator of the packet (i.e.,\r\nthe node imposing the explicit route may be the ingress node of an\r\noperator's network).\r\n\r\nThis document outlines various use cases, with their requirements,\r\nthat need to be taken into account by the Source Packet Routing in\r\nNetworking (SPRING) architecture for unicast traffic.  Multicast use\r\ncases and requirements are out of scope for this document.","pub_date":"May 2016","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7855","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7855"}
