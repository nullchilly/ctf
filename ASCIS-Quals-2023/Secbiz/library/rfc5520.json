Where the TE LSP\r\ncrosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous Systems (ASes), the\r\npath may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with each\r\nresponsible for computing a segment of the path.  However, in some\r\ncases (e.g., when ASes are administered by separate Service\r\nProviders), it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to\r\nsupply a path segment to a PCE in another domain, thus disclosing\r\nAS-internal topology information.  This issue may be circumvented\r\nby returning a loose hop and by invoking a new path computation\r\nfrom the domain boundary Label Switching Router (LSR) during TE\r\nLSP setup as the signaling message enters the second domain, but\r\nthis technique has several issues including the problem of\r\nmaintaining path diversity.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a mechanism to hide the contents of a\r\nsegment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS).  The\r\nCPS may be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE\r\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource\r\nReservation Protocol TE (RSVP-TE) explicit route object.  \r\n[STANDARDS-TRACK]","pub_date":"April 2009","keywords":["[--------]","confidential path segment","cps","pcep"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5520","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5520"}
