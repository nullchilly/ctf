This procedure is known\r\nas Address Resolution (AR) or Neighbor Discovery (ND).  Such address\r\nresolution complements the higher-layer resource discovery tools that\r\nare used to advertise IP sessions.\r\n\r\nIn MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID\r\n(PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex.  This document\r\nreviews current methods appropriate to a range of technologies (such\r\nas DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced Television Systems\r\nCommittee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications),\r\nand variants).  It also describes the interaction with well-known\r\nprotocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND\r\nprotocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"July 2007","keywords":["encapsulate","motion picture experts group","unidirectional link protocol","UniDirectional Link Routing","address resolution protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4947","errata_url":null}
