In particular, this variant utilizes\r\nIdentity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) framework that\r\nallows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication and\r\nderive a session key in an asymmetric Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)\r\nframework.  This protocol, in addition to providing mutual\r\nauthentication, eliminates the key escrow problem that is common in\r\nstandard IBE and provides perfect forward and backward secrecy.  \r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["Identity based encryption","authentication","key agreement"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6267","errata_url":null}
