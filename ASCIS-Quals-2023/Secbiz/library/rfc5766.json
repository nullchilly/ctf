In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use\r\nthe services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication\r\nrelay.  This specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal\r\nUsing Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control the\r\noperation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using\r\nthe relay.  TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in\r\nthat it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a\r\nsingle relay address.
