Turk"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"8","pub_status":"INFORMATIONAL","status":"INFORMATIONAL","source":"INDEPENDENT","abstract":" This document describes an operational technique that uses BGP communities to remotely trigger black-holing of a particular destination network to block denial-of-service attacks.  Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network.  The document also describes a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic into a sinkhole router for analysis.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
