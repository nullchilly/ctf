It registers the secp256k1 elliptic\r\ncurve in the IANA \"COSE Elliptic Curves\" registry.  Also, for use\r\nwith JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE), it registers the\r\nalgorithm ECDSA using the secp256k1 curve and SHA-256 in the IANA\r\n\"JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms\" registry and the\r\nsecp256k1 elliptic curve in the IANA \"JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve\"\r\nregistry.","pub_date":"August 2020","keywords":["Cryptography","Digital Signature","Encryption","W3C","World Wide Web Consortium","WebAuthn","Web Authentication","FIDO Alliance","FIDO","FIDO2","CTAP","CTAP2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8812","errata_url":null}
