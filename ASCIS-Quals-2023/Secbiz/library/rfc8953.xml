      workshop, sponsored by the Internet Society, took place on 28 February
      and 1 March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned
      regional, national, international, and enterprise Computer Security
      Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators, service providers, network
      and security operators, transport operators and researchers, incident
      response researchers, vendors, and participants from standards
      communities. This workshop continued the work started at the first CARIS
      workshop, with a focus on scaling incident prevention and detection as
      the Internet industry moves to a stronger and a more ubiquitous
      deployment of session encryption.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2
      workshop <xref target="CARISEvent" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CARISEvent"/>, sponsored by the
      Internet Society, took place on 28 February and 1 
      March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned
      regional, national, international, and enterprise Computer Security
      Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators, 
      service providers, network and security operators, transport operators
      and researchers, incident response researchers, vendors, and
      participants from standards communities. This workshop continued the
      work started at the first CARIS workshop <xref target="RFC8073" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8073"/>, with a focus on scaling 
      incident prevention and detection as the Internet industry moves to
      a stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of session encryption.

      Considering the related initiative to form a research group (Stopping
      Malware and Researching Threats <xref target="SMART" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SMART"/>) in the
      Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the focus on prevention included
      consideration of research opportunities to improve protocols and
      determine if there are ways to improve attack detection during
      the protocol design phase that could later influence protocol
      development in the IETF. This is one way to think about scaling
      response, through prevention and allowing for new methods to evolve for
      detection in a post-encrypted world.

Although the proposed SMART Research Group has not yet progressed, the work to better
scale incident response continues through the projects proposed at CARIS2 as
well as in future CARIS workshops.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">The goal of each CARIS workshop has been to focus on the challenge of
 improving the overall security posture.  The approach has been to
 identify intrinsic or built-in protection capabilities for improved defense,
 automation, and scaling attack response through collaboration and
 improved architectural patterns.  

It has been assumed that additional training will likely not address the lack
of information security professionals to fill the job gap.  Currently, there
is approximately a <xref target="deficit" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="deficit">three-million-person deficit</xref>
for security professionals worldwide, and that is only expected to grow. In
preparing for the workshop, the chair and program committee considered that
this gap cannot be filled through training but requires measures to reduce the
number of information security professionals needed through new architectures
and research toward attack prevention. CARIS2 was specifically focused on the
industry shift toward the increased use of stronger session encryption (<xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446">TLS 1.3</xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="QUIC">QUIC</xref>, <xref target="RFC8548" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8548">tcpcrypt</xref>, etc.) and how prevention and detection can
advance in this new paradigm. As such, the goals for this workshop

        decades, being replaced by a newer alternative, YANG (a data modeling
	language) that facilitates configuration management via the Network
	Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or RESTCONF. SNMP facilitated an
        answer to a needed problem set: configuration, telemetry, and network
        management. Its development considered the connection between the
        user, vendor, and developers. Challenges did surface for adoption from
        SNMPv1.1 to 1.2, as there was no compelling reason for adoption. SNMPv3
        gained adoption due to its resilience to attacks by providing
        protection through improved authentication and encryption.</t>

	the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) are somewhat similar in their goals, the
        standards were selected for evaluation by two separate groups with
        some common findings.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-3">STIX
	has had limited adoption by the financial sector but no 
        single, definitive end user. The standard is still in development with
        the US government as the primary developer in partnership with OASIS.
        There is interest in using STIX to manage content, but users don't
        really care about what technology is used for the exchange. The
        initial goals may not wind up matching the end result for STIX, as
        managing content may be the primary use case.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-4">IODEF was specified
        by National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) and Computer
	Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and formalized in the
	IETF <xref target="RFC7970" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7970"/>. The user is the 
        security operations center (SOC). While there are several
        implementations, it is not widely adopted. In terms of exchange, users
        are more interested in indicators than full event information, and this
        applies to STIX as well. Sharing and trust are additional hurdles as
        many are not willing to disclose information.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-5">DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) has DNSSEC as a
        dependency, which is a hurdle toward adoption (too many
        dependencies). It has a roll-your-own adoption model, which is risky.
        While there are some large pockets of adoption, there is still much
        work to do to gain widespread adoption. A regulatory requirement gave
        rise to partial adoption in Germany, which naturally resulted in
        production of documentation written in German -- possibly giving rise
        to further adoption in German-speaking countries. There has also been
        progress made in the Netherlands through the creation of a website:
        <eref target="internet.nl" brackets="angle"/>. The website allows you to test your website for a
        number of standards (IPv6, DNSSEC, DANE, etc.). <eref target="internet.nl" brackets="angle"/> is a

          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1.2-6">IP version 6 (IPv6) has struggled, and the expense of running a dual
        stack was one of the highest concerns on the list discussed in the
	workshop breakout. The end user for IPv6 is 
        everyone, and the breakout team considered it too ambiguous. Too many new requirements have been added
        over its 20-year life. The scope of necessary adoption is large with
        many peripheral devices. Government requirements for support have
        helped somewhat with improved interoperability and adoption, but
        features like NAT being added to IPv4 slowed adoption. With no new
        features being added to IPv4 and lessons learned, there's still a
        possibility for success.</t>

        Automated Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA), and Protocol for Automatic
        Security Configuration (PASC), which have themes of automation at scale. MUD
        was designed for Internet of Things (IoT), and as such, scaling was a major consideration.
        The PAVA and PASC work builds off of MUD and maintains some of the
        same themes. This breakout session was focused on groups brainstorming
        preventative measures and enabling vendors to deploy mitigations.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-2">One group dove a bit deeper into MUD and layer 2 (L2) discovery.
        MUD changes sets of filtering control
        management to the vendor or intermediary MUD vendors for a predictable
        platform that scales well.  While the overall value of MUD is clear, the
        use of MUD and what traffic is expected for a particular device should be considered
        sensitive information, as it could be used to exploit a device. MUD has
        an option of using L2 discovery to share MUD files. L2 discovery, like
        the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), is not encrypted from
        the local client to the DHCP server at this point in time (there is
        some interest to correct this, but it hasn't received enough support
        yet). As a result, it is possible to leak information and reveal data
        about the devices for which the MUD files would be applied. This could
        multicast out information such as network characteristics, firmware
        versions, manufacturers, etc. 



There was some discussion on the use of 802.11 to improve connections <xref target="IEEE802.11" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE802.11"/>. Several participants from this group plan to research
this further and identify options to prevent information leakage while
achieving the stated goals of MUD.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-3">The next group discussed a proposal one of the participants had
        already begun developing, namely privacy for rendezvous service. The
        basic idea was to encrypt Server Name Indication (SNI) using DNS to obtain public keys. The
        suffix on server IPv6 would be unique to a TLS session (information
        missing). The discussion on this proposal was fruitful, as the full set
        of attendees engaged, with special interest from the incident
        responders to be involved in early review cycles. Incident responders
        are very interested to understand how protocols will change and to
        assess the overall impact of changes on privacy and security
        operations. Even if there are no changes to the protocol proposals
        stemming from this review, the group discussion landed on this being a
        valuable exchange to understand early the impacts of changes for
        incident detection and mitigation, to devise new strategies, and to
        provide assessments on the impact of protocol changes on security in
        the round.</t>

 The third group reported back on trust exchanges relying heavily on

        determined that indicators of compromise (IoCs) are what most
        organizations and groups are able to successfully exchange. Ideally,
        these would be fixed and programmable. They discussed developing a

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-1">At the start of the second day of the workshop, <contact fullname="Kirsty Paine"/> and <contact fullname="Mirjam Kühne"/>
        prepared (and Kirsty led) a workshop-style session to discuss
        taxonomies used in incident response, attacks, and threat detection,
        comparing solutions and identifying gaps. 

  The primary objective was to determine a path forward by selecting the
  language to be used in the proposed SMART Research Group.


 Several taxonomies were presented for review and discussion. The topic
 remains open, but the following key points were highlighted by
 participants:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-4.5-2">
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.1">A single taxonomy might not be the way to go, because which
            taxonomy you use depends on what problem you are trying to solve,
            e.g., attribution of the attack, mitigation steps, technical
            features, or organizational impact measurements.</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.2">A tool to map between taxonomies should be automated, as there
            are requirements within groups or nations to use specific
            taxonomies.</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.3">The level of detail needed for reporting to management and for
            the analyst investigating the incident can be very different. At
            the workshop, one attendee mentioned that, for management reporting,
            they only use 8 categories to lighten the load on analysts,
            whereas some of the taxonomies contain 52 categories.</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.4">How you plan to use the taxonomy matters and may vary between
            use cases. Take, for instance, sharing data with external entities
            versus internal only. The taxonomy selected depends on what you
            plan to do with it. Some stated a need for attribute-based dynamic
            anthologies as opposed to rigid taxonomies used by others. A rigid
            taxonomy did not work for many from feedback in the session.</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.5">
            <xref target="RFC4949" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4949"/> was briefly discussed as a possibility; however, there
            is a clear need to update terminology in this publication around
            this space in particular. This is likely to be raised in the Security
	    Area Advisory Group (SAAG) during the open mic session,
            hopefully with proposed new definitions to demonstrate the issue
            and evolution of terms over time.</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.6">
  Within a taxonomy, prioritization matters to understand the impact of
  threats or an attack.  How do you map that between differing taxonomies?
  What is the problem to be solved, and what tooling is required?

</li>
          <li pn="section-4.5-2.7">Attack attribution had varying degrees of interest. 


Some felt the public sector cared more about attribution, not about
individuals.  They were interested in possible motivations behind an attack
and determining if there were other likely victims based on these motivations.

Understanding if the source was an individual actor, organized crime, or a
nation state mattered.
	  </li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-3">The result of this discussion was not to narrow down to one
        taxonomy but to think about mappings between taxonomies and the use
        cases for exchanging or sharing information, eventually giving rise to
        a common method to discuss threats and attacks. Researchers need a
        common vocabulary, not necessarily a common taxonomy.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document specifies "tcpcrypt", a TCP encryption protocol designed for use in conjunction with the TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO).  Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.  The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable. Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before application data can be transmitted.  However, the extra latency can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous tcpcrypt connection.</t>
