The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6\r\n(DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used to secure messages\r\nexchanged between servers and relay agents but does not require\r\nencryption.  With recent concerns about pervasive monitoring and\r\nother attacks, it is appropriate to require securing relay-to-relay\r\nand relay-to-server communication for DHCPv6 and relay-to-server\r\ncommunication for DHCPv4.\r\n","pub_date":"August 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8213","errata_url":null}
