The splicer is designed to handle RTP splicing and needs to\r\nknow when to start and end the splicing.\r\n\r\nThis memo defines two RTP\/RTCP extensions to indicate the\r\nsplicing-related information to the splicer: an RTP header extension\r\nthat conveys the information \"in band\" and an RTP Control Protocol\r\n(RTCP) packet that conveys the information out of band.","pub_date":"October 2017","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8286","errata_url":null}
