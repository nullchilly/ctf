For\r\nthese reasons, they are frequently used for large-scale content\r\ndelivery.  As a result, existing CDN Providers are scaling up their\r\ninfrastructure, and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are\r\ndeploying their own CDNs.  It is generally desirable that a given\r\ncontent item can be delivered to an End User regardless of that End\r\nUser's location or attachment network.  This is the motivation for\r\ninterconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open\r\ncontent delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of\r\ncontent from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to End Users.  However,\r\nno standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate\r\nsuch CDN Interconnection.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this document is to outline the problem area of CDN\r\nInterconnection for the IETF CDNI (CDN Interconnection) working\r\ngroup.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; \r\nit is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2012","keywords":["Delivery","CDN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6707","errata_url":null}
