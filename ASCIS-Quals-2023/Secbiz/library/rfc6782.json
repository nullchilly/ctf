These operators often face\r\ndifficult challenges related to IPv6 introduction, along with those\r\nrelated to IPv4 run-out.  Operators will need to meet the\r\nsimultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4\r\nconnectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant supply of IPv4\r\naddresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4-\r\nonly environment to an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition\r\nperiods varying by operator.  This document helps provide a framework\r\nfor wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of\r\nintroducing IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4\r\nconnectivity, utilizing well-defined and commercially available IPv6\r\ntransition technologies.  This document is not an Internet Standards \r\nTrack specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"November 2012","keywords":["transition","IPv6 transition","operator"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6782","errata_url":null}
