Once Last-Hop Routers (LHRs) receive packets from\r\na new source, they may join the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) for the\r\nsource for optimal forwarding.  This document defines a new mechanism\r\nthat provides a way to support PIM-SM without the need for PIM\r\nregisters, RPs, or shared trees.  Multicast source information is\r\nflooded throughout the multicast domain using a new generic PIM\r\nFlooding Mechanism (PFM).  This allows LHRs to learn about new\r\nsources without receiving initial data packets.","pub_date":"March 2018","keywords":["Multicast"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8736","RFC9436"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8364","errata_url":null}
