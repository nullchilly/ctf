It identifies the datagram services exposed to\r\napplications and how an application can configure and use the\r\nfeatures offered by the Internet datagram transport service.  RFC\r\n8303 documents the usage of transport features provided by IETF\r\ntransport protocols, describing the way UDP, UDP-Lite, and other\r\ntransport protocols expose their services to applications and how an\r\napplication can configure and use the features that make up these\r\nservices.  This document provides input to and context for that\r\ndocument, as well as offers a road map to documentation that may help\r\nusers of the UDP and UDP-Lite protocols.","pub_date":"February 2018","keywords":["UDP Transport"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8304","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8304"}
