The\r\nsimultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP\/IP session would\r\nimprove resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user\r\nexperience through higher throughput and improved resilience to\r\nnetwork failure.\r\n\r\nMultipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple\r\npaths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to\r\ntraditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers\r\nthe same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable\r\nbytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish\r\nand use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.  This \r\ndocument defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"January 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC8684"],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6824","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6824"}
