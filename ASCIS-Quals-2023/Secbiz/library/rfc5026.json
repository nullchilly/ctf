RFC 3775 requires that some or all of\r\nthese are statically configured.  This document defines how a Mobile\r\nIPv6 node can bootstrap this information from non-topological\r\ninformation and security credentials pre-configured on the Mobile\r\nNode.  The solution defined in this document solves the split\r\nscenario described in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement\r\nin RFC 4640.  The split scenario refers to the case where the Mobile\r\nNode's mobility service is authorized by a different service provider\r\nthan basic network access.  The solution described in this document\r\nis also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since other\r\nscenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario.
