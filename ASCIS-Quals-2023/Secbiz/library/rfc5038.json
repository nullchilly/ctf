A\r\nfundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers\r\n(LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward\r\ntraffic between and through them.  This common understanding is\r\nachieved by using a set of procedures, called a Label Distribution\r\nProtocol (as described in RFC 3036) , by which one LSR informs another\r\nof label bindings it has made.  One such protocol, called LDP, is used\r\nby LSRs to distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally\r\nrouted paths.  This document reports on a survey of LDP implementations\r\nconducted in August 2002 as part of the process of advancing LDP from\r\nProposed to Draft Standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.","pub_date":"October 2007","keywords":["multiprotocol label switching","mpls","lsr","label switched routers"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5038","errata_url":null}
