      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">Internet mail defines the From: header field to indicate the
                author of the message's content and the Sender: field to
                indicate who initially handled the message on the author's
                behalf. The Sender: field is optional if it has the same
                information as the From: field. This was not a problem until
                development of stringent protections on use of the From: field.
                It has prompted Mediators, such as mailing lists, to modify the
                From: field to circumvent mail rejection caused by those
                protections. In effect, the From: field has become dominated by
                its role as a handling identifier.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2"> The current specification augments the altered use of the From:
                field by specifying the Author: field, which ensures
                identification of the original author of the message and is not
                subject to modification by Mediators. This document is published

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Internet mail conducts asynchronous communication from an author
                to one or more recipients and is used for ongoing dialog
                amongst them. Email has a long history of serving a wide range
                of human uses and styles, within that simple framework, and the
                mechanisms for making email robust and safe serve that sole
                purpose.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2"> Internet mail defines the content header's From: field to
                indicate the author of the message and the Sender: field to
                indicate who initially handled the message on the author's
                behalf <xref target="RFC5322" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Mail-Fmt"/>. The Sender: field is optional
                if it has the same information as the From: field. That is, when
                the Sender: field is absent, the From: field has conflated
                semantics as both a handling identifier and a content creator
                identifier. These fields were initially defined in <xref target="RFC0733" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC733"/>, and making the redundant Sender: field
                optional was a small, obvious optimization in the days of
                slower communications, expensive storage, and less powerful
      computers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The dual semantics were not a problem until development of
                stringent protections on use of the From: field. It has prompted
                Mediators, such as mailing lists, to modify the From: field to
                circumvent receiver mail rejection caused by those protections.
                This affects end-to-end usability of email between the author
                and the final recipients, because mail received from the same
                author is treated differently by the recipient's software,
                depending on what path the message followed. </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">By way of example, mail originating with: </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt="" pn="section-1-5">
From:  Example User &lt;user@example.com&gt;
</artwork>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6"> which is sent directly to a recipient, will show the
                author's display name correctly and can correctly analyze,
                filter, and aggregate mail from the author based on their email
                address. However, if the author sends through a mailing list and
                the mailing list conducts a common form of From: modification
                needed to bypass enforcement of stringent authentication
                policies, then the received message might instead have a From:
                field showing: </t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt="" pn="section-1-7">
From: Example User via Example List &lt;listname@list.example.org&gt;
</artwork>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8"> The change inserts an operational address, for the
                Mediator, into the From: field and distorts the field's
                display name as a means of recording the modification.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-9">In terms of email identification semantics, this is a profound
                    change:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1-10">
        <li pn="section-1-10.1">The result is that the recipient's software will see the
                        message as being from an entirely different author and
                        will handle it separately, such as for sorting or
                        filtering.
                        In effect, the recipient's software will see
                        the same person's email as being from a different
                        address; this includes the person's actual address and each of the
                        mailing lists that person's mail transits.</li>
        <li pn="section-1-10.2">Mediators might create a Reply-To: field with the
                        original From: field email address. This facilitates
                        getting replies back to the original author, but it does
                        nothing to aid other processing or presentation done by
                        the recipient's Mail User Agent (MUA) based on what it
                        believes is the author's address or original
                        display name.
			This Reply-To action represents another
                        knock-on effect (e.g., collateral damage) by
			distorting the meaning
                        of that header field, as well as creating an issue if
                        the field already exists.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-11">In effect, the From: field has become dominated by its role as a
                handling identifier. The current specification augments this
                altered use of the From: field by specifying the Author: field,
                which identifies the original author of the message and is not
                subject to modification by Mediators.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-12">While it might be cleanest to move towards more reliable use of
                the Sender: field and then to target it as the focus of
                authentication concerns, enhancement of existing standards works
                best with incremental additions, rather than with efforts at
                replacement. To that end, this specification provides a means of
                supplying author information that is not subject to modification
                by processes seeking to enforce stringent authentication.</t>

              <t indent="0">Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF. It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t indent="0">Over its thirty-five-year history, Internet Mail has changed significantly in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  These changes have been evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve both its installed base and its usefulness.  To collaborate productively on this large and complex system, all participants need to work from a common view of it and use a common language to describe its components and the interactions among them.  But the many differences in perspective currently make it difficult to know exactly what another participant means.  To serve as the necessary common frame of reference, this document describes the enhanced Internet Mail architecture, reflecting the current service.

IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244. IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
