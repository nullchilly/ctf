Examples include different clients working on\r\nbehalf of the same user and multiple users accessing shared\r\nmailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to efficiently synchronize\r\nstate changes for messages within the mailbox.\r\n\r\nInitially defined in RFC 4551, the Conditional Store facility\r\nprovides a protected update mechanism for message state information\r\nand a mechanism for requesting only changes to the message state.\r\nThis memo updates that mechanism and obsoletes RFC 4551, based on\r\noperational experience.\r\n\r\nThis document additionally updates another IMAP extension, Quick\r\nResynchronization, which builds on the Conditional STORE extension to\r\nprovide an IMAP client the ability to fully resynchronize a mailbox\r\nas part of the SELECT\/EXAMINE command, without the need for\r\nadditional server-side state or client round trips.  Hence, this memo\r\nobsoletes RFC 5162.\r\n\r\nFinally, this document also updates the line-length recommendation in\r\nSection 3.2.1.5 of RFC 2683.","pub_date":"May 2014","keywords":["IMAP","CONDSTORE","QRESYNC","VANISHED","EXPUNGE","quick resynchronization"],"obsoletes":["RFC4551","RFC5162"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC2683"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7162","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7162"}
