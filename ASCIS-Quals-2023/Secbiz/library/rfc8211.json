The analysis is done from the\r\nperspective of an affected INR holder.  The analysis is based on\r\nexamination of the data items in the RPKI repository, as controlled\r\nby a CA (or an independent repository manager) and fetched by Relying\r\nParties (RPs).  The analysis does not purport to be comprehensive; it\r\ndoes represent an orderly way to analyze a number of ways that errors\r\nby or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI\r\nand routing decisions based on RPKI data.","pub_date":"September 2017","keywords":["BGP Security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8211","errata_url":null}
