When a PIM Join message is\r\nreceived at the border of the MPLS domain, information from that\r\nmessage is encoded into mLDP messages.  When the mLDP messages reach\r\nthe border of the next IP domain, the encoded information is used to\r\ngenerate PIM messages that can be sent through the IP domain.  The\r\nresult is an IP multicast tree consisting of a set of IP multicast\r\nsub-trees that are spliced together with a multipoint LSP.  This\r\ndocument describes procedures regarding how IP multicast trees are spliced\r\ntogether with multipoint LSPs.
