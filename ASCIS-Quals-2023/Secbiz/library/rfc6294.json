This paper describes the flow\r\nlabel standard and discusses the implementation issues that it\r\nraises.  It then describes various published proposals for using the\r\nflow label and shows that most of them are inconsistent with the\r\nstandard.  Methods to address this problem are briefly reviewed.  We\r\nalso question whether the standard should be revised.  This document \r\nis not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"June 2011","keywords":["Quality of service","QoS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6294","errata_url":null}
