The\r\nexchange is called \"TLS-PWD\".  The ciphersuites are all based on an\r\nauthentication and key exchange protocol, named \"dragonfly\", that is\r\nresistant to offline dictionary attacks.","pub_date":"February 2019","keywords":["Password Authenticated Key Exchange","Dictionary Attack","Authentication","TLS"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8492","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8492"}
