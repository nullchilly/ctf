Peers\r\nin a RELOAD overlay network collectively run an overlay algorithm to\r\norganize the overlay and to store and retrieve data.  This document\r\ndescribes how the default topology plugin of RELOAD can be extended\r\nto support self-tuning, that is, to adapt to changing operating\r\nconditions such as churn and network size.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["P2PSIP","P2P","Chord"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7363","errata_url":null}
