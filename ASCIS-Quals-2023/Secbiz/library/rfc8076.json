Shared\r\nResources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic primitive for enabling\r\nvarious coordination and notification schemes among distributed\r\npeers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical trust\r\ndelegation scheme maintained within an access list.  A new\r\nUSER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to write a Shared\r\nResource without owning its corresponding certificate.  This\r\nspecification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a variable\r\nname that is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous processes\r\nare required.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["P2PSIP","SIP","Conferencing","Voice over IP","Peer-to-Peer","Access Control","Group Management","Rendezvous"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8076","errata_url":null}
