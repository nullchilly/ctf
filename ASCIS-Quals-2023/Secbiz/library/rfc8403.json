Segment-based routing enables a scalable and\r\nsimple method to monitor data-plane liveliness of the complete set of\r\npaths belonging to a single domain.  The MPLS monitoring system adds\r\nfeatures to the traditional MPLS ping and Label Switched Path (LSP)\r\ntrace, in a very complementary way.  MPLS topology awareness reduces\r\nmanagement and control-plane involvement of Operations,\r\nAdministration, and Maintenance (OAM) measurements while enabling new\r\nOAM features.","pub_date":"July 2018","keywords":["Segment based Routing","OAM","LSP surveillance","MPLS monitoring"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8403","errata_url":null}
