The purpose of the framework is to provide\r\nan overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the\r\nrelationships among the various components necessary to interconnect\r\nCDNs.  CDNI requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms\r\nto address issues such as request routing, distribution metadata\r\nexchange, and logging information exchange across CDNs.  The intent\r\nof this document is to outline what each interface needs to\r\naccomplish and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit\r\ntogether, while leaving their detailed specification to other\r\ndocuments.  This document, in combination with RFC 6707, obsoletes\r\nRFC 3466.","pub_date":"August 2014","keywords":["CDNI","content delivery network","federation","cdni request routing","cdni logging","cdmi metadata","cdni control"],"obsoletes":["RFC3466"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7336","errata_url":null}
