Since these devices implement the \"edge\"\r\nof the LISP control plane infrastructure, connecting EID addressable\r\nnodes of a LISP site, the implementation and operational complexity\r\nof the overall cost and effort of deploying LISP is reduced.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 6830 and 6833.","pub_date":"October 2022","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC6830","RFC6833"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9301","errata_url":null}
