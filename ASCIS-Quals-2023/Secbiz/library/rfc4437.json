A redirect reference makes it possible to\r\naccess the target resourced indirectly through any URI mapped to the\r\nredirect reference resource.  This specification does not address\r\nremapping of trees of resources or regular expression based\r\nredirections.  There are no integrity guarantees associated with\r\nredirect reference resources.  Other mechanisms can also be used to\r\nachieve the same functionality as this specification.  This\r\nspecification allows operators to experiment with this mechanism and\r\ndevelop experience on what is the best approach to the problem.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"March 2006","keywords":["http","hyper text transfer protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC4437","errata_url":null}
