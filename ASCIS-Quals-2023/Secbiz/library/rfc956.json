Mills"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"26","pub_status":"UNKNOWN","status":"UNKNOWN","source":"Legacy","abstract":"    This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet community in    determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network    clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found    in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which    disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added    those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator    mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and    synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and    algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples    measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in this    report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication    of the effectiveness of the algorithms.
