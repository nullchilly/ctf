The\r\nadministrators face different challenges than operators of Internet\r\naccess providers and have reasons for different priorities.  The\r\noverall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet-\r\nfacing services over IPv6 while continuing to support IPv4, and while\r\nintroducing IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network.  The\r\noverall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-only\r\nenvironment to a dual-stack network environment and eventually an\r\nIPv6-only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework\r\nfor enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced\r\nwith many of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support\r\nstrategies.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["IPV6 migration transition enterprise"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7381","errata_url":null}
