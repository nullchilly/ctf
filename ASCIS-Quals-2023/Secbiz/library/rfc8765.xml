    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t pn="section-abstract-1">The Domain Name System (DNS) was designed to return matching records
      efficiently for queries for data that are relatively static.  When those
      records change frequently, DNS is still efficient at returning the
      updated results when polled, as long as the polling rate is not too
      high.
      But, there exists no mechanism for a client to be asynchronously
      notified
      when these changes occur.  This document defines a mechanism for a
      client to be notified of such changes to DNS records, called DNS Push
      Notifications.</t>

      <t pn="section-2-1">As the domain name system continues to adapt to new uses and changes
      in deployment, polling has the potential to burden DNS servers at many
      levels throughout the network. Other network protocols have successfully
      deployed a publish/subscribe model following the Observer design pattern
      <xref target="OBS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="OBS"/>.  Extensible Messaging and
      Presence Protocol (XMPP) Publish-Subscribe
      <xref target="XEP0060" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="XEP0060"/> and Atom <xref target="RFC4287" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4287"/> are examples. While DNS
      servers are generally highly tuned and capable of a high rate of
      query/response traffic, adding a publish/subscribe model for tracking
      changes to DNS records can deliver more timely notifications of changes
      with reduced CPU usage and lower network traffic.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-2">The guiding design principle of DNS Push Notifications
      is that clients that choose to use DNS Push Notifications,
      instead of repeated polling with DNS queries,
      will receive the same results as they could
      via sufficiently rapid polling, except more efficiently.
      This means that the rules for
      which records match a given DNS Push Notification subscription are the
      same as the already established rules used to determine
      which records match a given DNS query <xref target="RFC1034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1034"/>.
      For example, name comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner,
      and a record of type CNAME in a zone matches any DNS TYPE in a query or
      subscription.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-3">Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6762"/>
      implementations always listen on a well-known link-local IP multicast
      group address, and changes are sent to that multicast group address for
      all group members to receive.  Therefore, Multicast DNS already has
      asynchronous change notification capability.  When DNS-based Service Discovery
      <xref target="RFC6763" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6763"/> is used across a wide
      area network using Unicast DNS (possibly facilitated via a Discovery
      Proxy <xref target="RFC8766" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8766"/>), it would be
      beneficial to have an equivalent capability for Unicast DNS in order to
      allow clients to learn about DNS record changes in a timely manner
      without polling.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-4">The DNS Long-Lived Queries (LLQ) mechanism <xref target="RFC8764" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8764"/> is an existing deployed solution to provide
      asynchronous change notifications; it was used by Apple's Back to
      My Mac <xref target="RFC6281" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6281"/> service
      introduced in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007.  Back to My Mac was
      designed in an era when the data center operations staff asserted that
      it was impossible for a server to handle large numbers of
      TCP connections, even if those connections carried
      very little traffic and spent most of their time idle.
      Consequently, LLQ was defined as a UDP-based protocol, effectively
      replicating much of TCP's connection state management logic in user
      space and creating its own imitation of existing TCP features like flow
      control, reliability, and the three-way handshake.</t>
      <t pn="section-2-5">This document builds on experience gained with the LLQ protocol, with

      Stateful Operations (DSO) <xref target="RFC8490" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8490"/> running over TLS over TCP, and therefore
      doesn't need to reinvent existing TCP functionality.  Using TCP also
      gives long-lived low-traffic connections better longevity through NAT

        stale (e.g., an SRV record referencing a target host+port that is not
        responding to connection requests), the client can send a RECONFIRM
        message to ask the server to re-verify that the data is still
        valid. For a Discovery Proxy, this causes it to issue new Multicast
        DNS queries to ascertain whether the target device is still
        present. How the Discovery Proxy causes these new Multicast DNS
        queries to be issued depends on the details of the underlying
        Multicast DNS implementation being used.  For example, a Discovery
        Proxy built on Apple's dns_sd.h API <xref target="SD-API" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SD-API"/> responds to a DNS Push Notification RECONFIRM

        <t pn="section-6.7-1">An individual subscription is terminated by sending an UNSUBSCRIBE
        TLV for that specific subscription, or all subscriptions can be
        canceled at once by the client closing the DSO session. When a client
        terminates an individual subscription (via UNSUBSCRIBE) or all
        subscriptions on that DSO session (by ending the session), it is
        signaling to the server that it is no longer interested in receiving
        those particular updates. It is informing the server that the server
        may release any state information it has been keeping with regards to
        these particular subscriptions.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.7-2">After terminating its last subscription on a session via
        UNSUBSCRIBE, a client <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> close the session immediately
        or it may keep it open if it anticipates performing further operations
        on that session in the future. If a client wishes to keep an idle
        session open, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> respect the maximum idle time
        required by the server <xref target="RFC8490" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8490"/>.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.7-3">If a client plans to terminate one or more subscriptions on a
        session and doesn't intend to keep that session open, then as an
        efficiency optimization, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> instead choose to
	simply
        close the session, which implicitly terminates all subscriptions on
        that session. This may occur because the client computer is being shut
        down, is going to sleep, the application requiring the subscriptions
        has terminated, or simply because the last active subscription on that
        session has been canceled.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.7-4">When closing a session, a client should perform an orderly close of
        the TLS session.  Typical APIs will provide a session close method
        that will send a TLS close_notify alert as described in <xref target="RFC8446" sectionFormat="of" section="6.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-6.1" derivedContent="RFC8446">the TLS 1.3 specification</xref>.
	This instructs the
        recipient that the sender will not send any more data over the
        session.  After sending the TLS close_notify alert, the client
        <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> gracefully close the underlying connection using a
        TCP FIN so that the TLS close_notify is reliably delivered.  The
        mechanisms for gracefully closing a TCP connection with a TCP FIN vary
        depending on the networking API.  For example, in the BSD Sockets API,
        sending a TCP FIN is achieved by calling "shutdown(s,SHUT_WR)" and
        keeping the socket open until all remaining data has been read from
        it.</t>

        <t pn="section-6.8-1">There are cases where a client may exhaust all avenues for
        establishing a DNS Push Notification subscription without success.
        This can happen if the client's configured recursive resolver does not
        support DNS over TLS, or supports DNS over TLS but is not listening on
        TCP port 853, or supports DNS over TLS on TCP port 853 but does not
        support DSO on that port, or for some other reason is unable to
        provide a DNS Push Notification subscription.  In this case, the
	client
        will attempt to communicate directly with an appropriate server, and
        it may be that the zone apex discovery fails, or there is no
        <tt>_dns‑push‑tls._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;</tt> SRV record, or
        the server indicated in the SRV record is misconfigured, overloaded,
	or is
        unresponsive for some other reason.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.8-2">Regardless of the reason for the failure, after being unable to
        establish the desired DNS Push Notification subscription, it is likely
        that the client will still wish to know the answer it seeks, even if
        that answer cannot be obtained with the timely change notifications
        provided by DNS Push Notifications.  In such cases, it is likely that
        the client will obtain the answer it seeks via a conventional DNS
        query instead, repeated at some interval to detect when the answer
        RRset changes.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.8-3">In the case where a client responds to its failure to establish a
        DNS Push Notification subscription by falling back to polling with
        conventional DNS queries instead, the polling rate should be
        controlled to avoid placing excessive burden on the server.  The
        interval between successive DNS queries for the same name, type, and
        class <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be at least the minimum of 900 seconds (15
        minutes) or two seconds more than the TTL of the answer RRset.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.8-4">The reason that for TTLs up to 898 seconds the query should
        not be reissued until two seconds <em>after</em> the answer RRset has
        expired, is to ensure that the answer RRset has also expired from the
        cache on the client's configured recursive resolver.  Otherwise
        (particularly if the clocks on the client and the recursive resolver
        do not run at precisely the same rate), there's a risk of a race
        condition where the client queries its configured recursive resolver
        just as the answer RRset has one second remaining in the recursive
        resolver's cache.  The client would receive a reply telling it
        that the answer RRset has one second remaining; the client
        would then requery the recursive resolver again one second later.
        If by this time the answer RRset has actually expired from the
        recursive resolver's cache, the recursive resolver would then
        issue a new query to fetch fresh data from the
        authoritative server.  Waiting until the answer RRset has definitely
        expired from the cache on the client's configured recursive resolver
        avoids this race condition and any unnecessary additional queries it
        causes.</t>
        <t pn="section-6.8-5">Each time a client is about to reissue its query to discover
        changes to the answer RRset, it should first make a new attempt to
        establish a DNS Push Notification subscription using previously
        cached DNS answers as appropriate.  After a temporary misconfiguration
        has been remedied, this allows a client that is polling to return to
        using DNS Push Notifications for asynchronous notification of
        changes.</t>

        <t pn="section-7.3-2">However, there are some factors to consider before using TLS early
	data.</t>
        <t pn="section-7.3-3">TLS early data is not forward secret.
       In cases where forward secrecy of DNS Push Notification subscriptions
       is required,
       the client should not use TLS early data.</t>
        <t pn="section-7.3-4">With TLS early data, there are no guarantees of non-replay between
	connections.
       If packets are duplicated and delayed in the network,
       the later arrivals could be mistaken for new subscription requests.
       Generally, this is not a major concern
       since the amount of state generated on the server for
       these spurious subscriptions is small and short lived
       since the TCP connection will not complete the three-way handshake.
       Servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose to implement rate-limiting measures
       that are activated when
       the server detects an excessive number of spurious subscription
       requests.</t>
        <t pn="section-7.3-5">For further guidance on use of TLS early data, please see
	discussion of zero round-trip data

       is permissible on DNS Push Notification servers.
       However, closing the TLS connection terminates the DSO session.
       When the TLS session is resumed, the DNS Push Notification server will
       not
       have any subscription state and will proceed as with any other new DSO
       session.
       Use of TLS session resumption may allow a TLS connection to be set up
       more quickly,
       but the client will still have to recreate any desired
       subscriptions.</t>

              <t>The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) specification (RFC 6698) describes how to use TLSA resource records secured by DNSSEC (RFC 4033) to associate a server's connection endpoint with its Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (thus enabling administrators of domain names to specify the keys used in that domain's TLS servers).  However, application protocols that use SRV records (RFC 2782) to indirectly name the target server connection endpoints for a service domain name cannot apply the rules from RFC 6698.  Therefore, this document provides guidelines that enable such protocols to locate and use TLSA records.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs), sent with forged IP source addresses (spoofing).  TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoofing attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers.  For pairs of well-known endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or between web servers and well-known large-scale caches, increases in the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently increased the receive window space that off-path third parties can brute-force generate a viable RST sequence number.  The susceptibility to attack increases with the square of the bandwidth, and thus presents a significant vulnerability for recent high-speed networks.  This document addresses this vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing network level solutions and the feasibility of their deployment.  This document focuses on vulnerabilities due to spoofed TCP segments, and includes a discussion of related ICMP spoofing attacks on TCP connections.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

              <t>This document describes the implementation of Apple Inc.'s Back to My Mac (BTMM) service.  BTMM provides network connectivity between devices so that a user can perform file sharing and screen sharing among multiple computers at home, at work, or on the road.  The implementation of BTMM addresses the issues of single sign-on authentication, secure data communication, service discovery, and end-to-end connectivity in the face of Network Address Translators (NATs) and mobility of devices.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.  In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t>
              <t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.  In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t>
              <t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t>

              <t>This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings.  Included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the external IPv4 address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make its external IPv4 address and port known to peers that may wish to communicate with it. From 2005 onwards, this protocol was implemented in Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.  In 2013, NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) was superseded by the IETF Standards Track RFC "Port Control Protocol (PCP)", which builds on NAT-PMP and uses a compatible packet format, but adds a number of significant enhancements.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism called TCP Fast Open (TFO).  TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.  However, TFO deviates from the standard TCP semantics, since the data in the SYN could be replayed to an application in some rare circumstances.  Applications should not use TFO unless they can tolerate this issue, as detailed in the Applicability section.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations that is independent of encoding and transport.  The model consists of several objects, including Printers and Jobs.  Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.</t>
              <t>IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities; submit Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print Jobs and Printers; and cancel, hold, and release Print Jobs.  IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.</t>
              <t>Security, internationalization, and directory issues are also addressed by the model and semantics.  The IPP message encoding and transport are described in "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding                                   and Transport" (RFC 8010).</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.</t>
              <t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</t>
              <t>This document specifies v1 of Multipath TCP, obsoleting v0 as specified in RFC 6824, through clarifications and modifications primarily driven by deployment experience.</t>

RACK uses the notion of time, instead of packet or sequence counts, to detect losses, for modern TCP implementations that can support per-packet timestamps and the selective acknowledgment (SACK) option.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DUPACK threshold approach [RFC6675], as well as other nonstandard approaches such as FACK [FACK].</t>
