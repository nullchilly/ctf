However, those\r\nspecifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such\r\nroute, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single\r\ntunnel.  Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise\r\nthat a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all\r\ncustomer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all\r\nthe provider edge routers of the MVPN.  This document eliminates\r\nthese restrictions by specifying the use of \"wildcard\" elements in\r\nthe customer flow identifiers.  With wildcard elements, a single\r\nauto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to\r\nall customer flows.
