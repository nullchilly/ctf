These options enable robust and\r\nfaster transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet\r\ninterchanges as well as support for faster recovery should any of the\r\nblocks get lost in transmission (especially during DDoS attacks).\r\n\r\nAlso, this document defines a YANG data model for representing these\r\nnew DOTS signal channel configuration parameters. This model augments\r\nthe DOTS signal YANG module (\"ietf-dots-signal-channel\") defined in\r\nRFC 9132.","pub_date":"February 2023","keywords":["Quick-Block","Robust-Block","R-Block","Tough-Block","Resilient-Block","Fast-Block","Resilience","Filtering","Faster transmission","Large amounts of data","Less packet interchange","Fast recovery"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9362","errata_url":null}
