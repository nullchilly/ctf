In particular, it defines support for the header-free\r\nand interleaved\/bundled packet formats for the EVRC-B codec, a new\r\ncompact bundled format for the EVRC and EVRC-B codecs, as well as\r\ndiscontinuous transmission (DTX) support for EVRC and EVRC-B-encoded\r\nspeech transported via RTP.  Voice over IP (VoIP) applications\r\noperating over low bandwidth dial-up and wireless networks require\r\nsuch enhancements for efficient use of the bandwidth.
