When reoptimizing a large number of S2L\r\nsub-LSPs in a tree using the Sub-Group-based reoptimization method,\r\nthe S2L sub-LSP descriptor list may need to be semantically\r\nfragmented.  This document defines the notion of a fragment\r\nidentifier to help recipient nodes unambiguously reconstruct the\r\nfragmented S2L sub-LSP descriptor list.","pub_date":"April 2017","keywords":["RSVP fragmentation","RSVP fragment identifier","P2MP-TE tree reoptimization","P2MP-TE tree re-evaluation","Preferable P2MP-TE tree","Inter-domain P2MP-TE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8149","errata_url":null}
