RFC 3175 also defines how\r\nend-to-end RSVP reservations can be aggregated onto such aggregate\r\nreservations when transiting through a Diffserv cloud.  There are\r\nsituations where multiple such aggregate reservations are needed for\r\nthe same source IP address, destination IP address, and PHB (or set of\r\nPHBs).  However, this is not supported by the aggregate reservations\r\ndefined in RFC 3175.  In order to support this, the present document\r\ndefines a more flexible type of aggregate RSVP reservations, referred\r\nto as generic aggregate reservation.  Multiple such generic aggregate\r\nreservations can be established for a given PHB (or set of PHBs) from\r\na given source IP address to a given destination IP address.  The\r\ngeneric aggregate reservations may be used to aggregate end-to-end\r\nRSVP reservations.  This document also defines the procedures for such\r\naggregation.  The generic aggregate reservations may also be used\r\nend-to-end directly by end-systems attached to a Diffserv network.
