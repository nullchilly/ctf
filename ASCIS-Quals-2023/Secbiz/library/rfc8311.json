{"draft":"draft-ietf-tsvwg-ecn-experimentation-08","doc_id":"RFC8311","title":"Relaxing Restrictions on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Experimentation","authors":["D. Black"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"20","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Transport and Services Working Group","abstract":"This memo updates RFC 3168, which specifies Explicit Congestion\r\nNotification (ECN) as an alternative to packet drops for indicating\r\nnetwork congestion to endpoints.  It relaxes restrictions in RFC 3168\r\nthat hinder experimentation towards benefits beyond just removal of\r\nloss.  This memo summarizes the anticipated areas of experimentation\r\nand updates RFC 3168 to enable experimentation in these areas.  An\r\nExperimental RFC in the IETF document stream is required to take\r\nadvantage of any of these enabling updates.  In addition, this memo\r\nmakes related updates to the ECN specifications for RTP in RFC 6679\r\nand for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) in RFCs 4341,\r\n4342, and 5622.  This memo also records the conclusion of the ECN\r\nnonce experiment in RFC 3540 and provides the rationale for\r\nreclassification of RFC 3540 from Experimental to Historic; this\r\nreclassification enables new experimental use of the ECT(1)\r\ncodepoint.","pub_date":"January 2018","keywords":["ECN"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3168","RFC4341","RFC4342","RFC5622","RFC6679"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8311","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8311"}
