IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management\r\n(CFM) specifies an adjunct Operations, Administration, and\r\nMaintenance (OAM) flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.\r\nCFM can also be used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and\r\ntriggering recovery mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification\r\nbuilds on CFM and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including\r\nPerformance Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This document\r\nspecifies extensions of the GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol to support the\r\nsetup of the associated Ethernet OAM entities of Ethernet LSPs and\r\ndefines the Ethernet technology-specific TLVs based on the GMPLS OAM\r\nConfiguration Framework.  This document supports, but does not\r\nmodify, the IEEE and ITU-T OAM mechanisms.","pub_date":"October 2014","keywords":["GELS","Ethernet Label Switching","PBB-TE","connectivity monitoring","OAM configuration"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7369","errata_url":null}
