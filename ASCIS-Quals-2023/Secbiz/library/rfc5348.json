TFRC is a\r\ncongestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a\r\nbest-effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when\r\ncompeting for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation\r\nof throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for\r\napplications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth sending\r\nrate is of importance.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC 4342.
