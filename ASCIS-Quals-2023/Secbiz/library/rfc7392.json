This document specifies the extensions and procedures required\r\nto enable dynamic MS-PWs to be established along explicit paths.","pub_date":"December 2014","keywords":["Pseudowire","MS-PW","explicit route"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7392","errata_url":null}
