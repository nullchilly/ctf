This document describes how such\r\nVLANs can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise,\r\nwhich focuses on the scenario of early deployment prior to\r\navailability of IPv6-capable switch-router equipment.  In this\r\nmethod, IPv6 may be routed in parallel with the existing IPv4 in the\r\nenterprise and delivered at Layer 2 via VLAN technology.  The IPv6\r\nconnectivity to the enterprise may or may not enter the site via the\r\nsame physical link.
