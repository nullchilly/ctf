It is also possible to use pseudowires to provide\r\nlow-rate Time Division Multiplexed and a Synchronous Optical\r\nNETworking circuit emulation over an MPLS-enabled network.  This\r\ndocument specifies a protocol for establishing and maintaining the\r\npseudowires, using extensions to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).\r\nProcedures for encapsulating Layer 2 PDUs are specified in a set of\r\ncompanion documents.
