The discussion focuses on link addresses and, to a small\r\nextent, loopback addresses.  While many of the issues are well\r\nrecognised within the ISP community, there appears to be no document\r\nthat collectively describes the issues.  This document is not an Internet \r\nStandards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.","pub_date":"September 2012","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6752","errata_url":null}
