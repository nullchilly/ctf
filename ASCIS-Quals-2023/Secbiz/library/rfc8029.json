It defines a probe message called an \"MPLS                       \r\necho request\" and a response message called an \"MPLS echo reply\" for\r\nreturning the result of the probe.  The MPLS echo request is intended\r\nto contain sufficient information to check correct operation of the\r\ndata plane and to verify the data plane against the control plane,\r\nthereby localizing faults.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 4379, 6424, 6829, and 7537, and updates\r\nRFC 1122.","pub_date":"March 2017","keywords":["MPLS echo request","MPLS echo reply"],"obsoletes":["RFC4379","RFC6424","RFC6829","RFC7537"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC1122"],"updated_by":["RFC8611","RFC9041"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8029","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc8029"}
