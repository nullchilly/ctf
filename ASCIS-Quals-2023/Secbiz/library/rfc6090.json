These descriptions may be useful for\r\nimplementing the fundamental algorithms without using any of the\r\nspecialized methods that were developed in following years.  Only\r\nelliptic curves defined over fields of characteristic greater than\r\nthree are in scope; these curves are those used in Suite B.\r\nThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is\r\npublished for informational purposes.","pub_date":"February 2011","keywords":["ECC"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6090","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6090"}
