The transforms are based on the GOST R\r\n34.12-2015 block ciphers (which are named \"Magma\" and \"Kuznyechik\")\r\nin Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) and the external rekeying approach. \r\n\r\nThis specification was developed to facilitate implementations that\r\nwish to support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply\r\nIETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used in this\r\ndocument.","pub_date":"March 2022","keywords":["AEAD","MGM"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9227","errata_url":null}
