The association is achieved by defining new\r\nAssociation Types for use in ASSOCIATION and in Extended ASSOCIATION Objects.\r\nOne of these types enables independent provisioning of the associated\r\nbidirectional LSPs on both sides, while the other enables single-sided\r\nprovisioning.  The REVERSE_LSP Object is also defined to enable a single\r\nendpoint to trigger creation of the reverse LSP and to specify parameters of\r\nthe reverse LSP in the single-sided provisioning case.","pub_date":"May 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC8537"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7551","errata_url":null}
