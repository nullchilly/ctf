Typically, all BGP\r\nspeakers within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external\r\nrouting information must be re-distributed to all other routers\r\nwithin that Autonomous System (AS).  This represents a serious scaling\r\nproblem that has been well documented with several alternatives proposed.\r\n\r\nThis document describes the use and design of a method known as\r\n\"route reflection\" to alleviate the need for \"full mesh\" Internal\r\nBGP (IBGP).\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFC 2796 and RFC 1966.
