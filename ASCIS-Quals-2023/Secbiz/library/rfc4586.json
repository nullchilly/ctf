Unicast and multicast topologies are considered as\r\nwell as several protocol and environment configurations.  The\r\nresults show that the timing rules result in better performance\r\nregarding feedback delay and still preserve the well-accepted RTP\r\nrules regarding allowed bit rates for control traffic.
