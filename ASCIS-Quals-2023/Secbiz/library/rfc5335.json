It also requires being able to\r\nexpress those addresses and the information based on them in mail\r\nheader fields.  This document specifies an experimental variant of\r\nInternet mail that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8,\r\nrather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field.\r\nThis form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP\r\nextension, as specified in an associated specification.  This\r\nspecification Updates section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to conform with the\r\nrequirements.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet\r\ncommunity.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","unicode","utf-8"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":["RFC6532"],"updates":["RFC2045","RFC2822"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5335","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc5335"}
