This document describes the known limitations of\r\nwireless (primarily 802.11) Layer 2 multicast.  Also described are\r\ncertain multicast enhancement features that have been specified by\r\nthe IETF and by IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as some\r\noperational choices that can be made to improve the performance of\r\nthe network.  Finally, some recommendations are provided about the\r\nusage and combination of these features and operational choices.","pub_date":"October 2021","keywords":["Multicast","IEEE 802 Wireless Multicast","Broadcast","BUM","wifi","wireless"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9119","errata_url":null}
