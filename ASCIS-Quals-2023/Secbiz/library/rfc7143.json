The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with\r\nthe standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2).  RFC 3720\r\ndefined the original iSCSI protocol.  RFC 3721 discusses iSCSI\r\nnaming examples and discovery techniques.  Subsequently, RFC 3980\r\nadded an additional naming format to the iSCSI protocol.  RFC 4850\r\nfollowed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI.  RFC\r\n5048 offered a number of clarifications as well as a few\r\nimprovements and corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850, and 5048 by\r\nconsolidating them into a single document and making additional\r\nupdates to the consolidated specification.  This document also\r\nupdates RFC 3721.  The text in this document thus supersedes the\r\ntext in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a difference in\r\nsemantics.","pub_date":"April 2014","keywords":["iSCSI","SCSI","storage","SAN","block storage","SCSI object storage devices","OSD","SAM","disk","T10"],"obsoletes":["RFC3720","RFC3980","RFC4850","RFC5048"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3721"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7143","errata_url":null}
