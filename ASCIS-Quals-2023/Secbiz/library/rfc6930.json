The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been\r\ndefined to configure the 6rd Customer Edge (CE).  However, in many\r\nnetworks, the configuration information may be stored in\r\nthe Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers, while user\r\nconfiguration is mainly acquired from a Broadband Network Gateway\r\n(BNG) through the DHCP protocol.  This document defines a Remote\r\nAuthentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries\r\n6rd configuration information from the AAA server to BNGs.","pub_date":"April 2013","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC6930","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc6930"}
