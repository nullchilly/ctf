These routing enhancements\r\nare applicable in common optical or hybrid electro-optical networks\r\nwhere not all the optical signals in the network are compatible\r\nwith all network elements participating in the network.\r\n\r\nThis compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical\r\nor hybrid electro-optical systems such as optical-electronic-optical\r\n(OEO) switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters, since such\r\nsystems can be limited to processing only certain types of WSON\r\nsignals.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7688","errata_url":null}
