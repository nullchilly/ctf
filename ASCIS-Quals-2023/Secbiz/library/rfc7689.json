Such extensions are applicable in WSONs\r\nunder a number of conditions including: (a) when optional\r\nprocessing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at\r\nspecific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured\r\nto accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where\r\nequipment must be configured to output an optical signal with\r\nspecific attributes.  This document provides mechanisms to\r\nsupport distributed wavelength assignment with a choice of distributed\r\nwavelength assignment algorithms.","pub_date":"November 2015","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7689","errata_url":null}
