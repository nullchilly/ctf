This document defines MULE (Multicast\r\nEmail), an application protocol for transferring Internet Mail\r\nmessages (as described in RFC 5322) over P_MUL (as defined in ACP\r\n142).  MULE enables transfer between Message Transfer Agents (MTAs).\r\nIt doesn't provide a service similar to SMTP Submission (as described\r\nin RFC 6409).\r\n\r\nThis document explains how MULE can be used in conjunction with SMTP\r\n(RFC 5321), including some common SMTP extensions, to provide an\r\nalternate MTA-to-MTA transfer mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis is not an IETF specification; it describes an existing\r\nimplementation.  It is provided in order to facilitate interoperable\r\nimplementations and third-party diagnostics.","pub_date":"November 2018","keywords":["P_MUL"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8494","errata_url":null}
