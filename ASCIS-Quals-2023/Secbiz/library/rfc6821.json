Some of this discussion has produced controversial\r\nmyths, some rooted in reality while others remain unfounded.  This\r\ndocument evaluates the most prominent myths attributed to P2P\r\noptimization techniques by referencing the most relevant study or\r\nstudies that have addressed facts pertaining to the myth.
