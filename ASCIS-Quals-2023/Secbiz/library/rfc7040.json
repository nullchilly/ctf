Public 4over6 was developed in\r\nthe IETF and is in use in some existing deployments but is not\r\nrecommended for new deployments.  Future deployments of similar\r\nscenarios should use Lightweight 4over6.  Public 4over6 follows the\r\nHub and Spoke softwire model and uses an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel to\r\nforward IPv4 packets over an IPv6 access network.  The\r\nbidirectionality of the IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly\r\nallocating global non-shared IPv4 addresses to end users and by\r\nmaintaining IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  Public\r\n4over6 aims to provide uninterrupted IPv4 services to users, like\r\nInternet Content Providers (ICPs), etc., while an operator makes the\r\naccess network transition to an IPv6-only access network.","pub_date":"November 2013","keywords":["Public 4over6","IPv4 over IPv6","Access Network","DHCPv4 over IPv6","IPv6 Tunnel","IPv6 Transition"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7040","errata_url":null}
