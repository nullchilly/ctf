LTP does Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) of data\r\ntransmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment reception\r\nreports.  It is stateful and has no negotiation or handshakes.  This\r\ndocument describes security extensions to LTP, and is part of a\r\nseries of related documents describing LTP.\r\n\r\nThis document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research\r\nGroup and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its\r\npublication as an RFC were raised.  This memo defines an Experimental \r\nProtocol for the Internet community.","pub_date":"September 2008","keywords":["[--------]","ltp","radio frequency","automatic repeat request","arq"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC5327","errata_url":null}
