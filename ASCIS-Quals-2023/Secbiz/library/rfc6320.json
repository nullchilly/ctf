Use cases\r\nfor ANCP are documented in RFC 5851.  As well as describing the base\r\nANCP protocol, this document specifies capabilities for Digital\r\nSubscriber Line (DSL) topology discovery, line configuration, and\r\nremote line connectivity testing.  The design of ANCP allows for\r\nprotocol extensions in other documents if they are needed to support\r\nother use cases and other access technologies.\r\n\r\nANCP is based on the General Switch Management Protocol version 3\r\n(GSMPv3) described in RFC 3292, but with many modifications and\r\nextensions, to the point that the two protocols are not\r\ninteroperable.  For this reason, ANCP was assigned a separate version\r\nnumber to distinguish it.
