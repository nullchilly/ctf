In that spirit, the\r\nForwarding Element Manager (FEM) is modeled by creating a Logical\r\nFunctional Block (LFB) to represent its functionality.  We refer to\r\nthis LFB as the Subsidiary Mechanism (SM) LFB.  A Control Element\r\n(CE) that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can also\r\nmanage its configuration via the SM LFB.  This document introduces\r\nthe SM LFB class, an LFB class that specifies the configuration\r\nparameters of an FE.  The configuration parameters include new LFB\r\nclass loading and CE associations; they also provide manipulation of\r\ndebug mechanisms along with a general purpose attribute definition to\r\ndescribe configuration information.","pub_date":"December 2015","keywords":["ForCES","LFB","Subsidiary Management","Virtualization"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7729","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc7729"}
