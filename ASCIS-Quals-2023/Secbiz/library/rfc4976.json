The Message Session Relay Protocol\r\n(MSRP) is a protocol for near real-time, peer-to-peer exchanges of\r\nbinary content without intermediaries, which is designed to be\r\nsignaled using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP.  This\r\ndocument introduces the notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP\r\nand describes the extensions necessary to use them.
