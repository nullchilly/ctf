The proposed solutions hide\r\na hidden service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI\r\nof the fronting service to external observers. This document lists\r\nknown attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current \"HTTP\r\nco-tenancy\" solution, and presents requirements for future TLS-layer\r\nsolutions. \r\n\r\nIn practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every\r\nrequirement and that practical solutions will have to make some\r\ncompromises.","pub_date":"July 2020","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC8744","errata_url":null}
