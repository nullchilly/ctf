Suignard"],"format":["ASCII","HTML"],"page_count":"46","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"IETF - NON WORKING GROUP","abstract":"This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized  Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource  Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the  Universal Character Set (Unicode\/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to   URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs,  where appropriate, to identify resources.\r\n\r\n The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs.  This was done in order  to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with  existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs.","pub_date":"December 2004","keywords":["uri","uniform resource identifier","Universal Character Set"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC3987","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc3987"}
