To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they are\r\nexpected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently, while\r\nthey are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6-layer\r\nperspective, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able\r\nto use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nThe Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally\r\ndefined in RFC 4843 lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm\r\nagility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document\r\nremoves this limitation by encoding, in the identifier itself, an\r\nindex to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.","pub_date":"September 2014","keywords":["HIP","HIPv2","ORCHID","CGA","API"],"obsoletes":["RFC4843"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":["RFC9374"],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC7343","errata_url":null}
