However, all those cipher suites use\r\nSHA-1 in their Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.  This\r\ndocument describes a set of pre-shared key cipher suites for TLS that\r\nuses stronger digest algorithms (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384) and\r\nanother set that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in\r\nGalois Counter Mode (GCM).
