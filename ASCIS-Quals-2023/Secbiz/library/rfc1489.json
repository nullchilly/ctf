Factually, \"koi8-r\" is de-facto standard for Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.  This is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes \"koi8-r\" should be registered.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.
